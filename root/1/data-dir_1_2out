hosts,	1
doth	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
from	1
Judah	1
the	1
stay	1
and	1
the	1
staff,	1
the	1
whole	1
stay	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
stay	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
3:2	1
The	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
the	1
prudent,	1
and	1
the	1
ancient,	1
3:3	1
The	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty,	1
and	1
the	1
honourable	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
counsellor,	1
and	1
the	1
cunning	1
artificer,	1
and	1
the	1
eloquent	1
orator.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
children	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
babes	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
oppressed,	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
another,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
behave	1
himself	1
proudly	1
against	1
the	1
ancient,	1
and	1
the	1
base	1
against	1
the	1
honourable.	1
	1
3:6	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
clothing,	1
be	1
thou	1
our	1
ruler,	1
and	1
let	1
this	1
ruin	1
be	1
under	1
thy	1
hand:	1
3:7	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
he	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
healer;	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
neither	1
bread	1
nor	1
clothing:	1
make	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:8	1
For	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
ruined,	1
and	1
Judah	1
is	1
fallen:	1
because	1
their	1
tongue	1
and	1
their	1
doings	1
are	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
shew	1
of	1
their	1
countenance	1
doth	1
witness	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
declare	1
their	1
sin	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
they	1
hide	1
it	1
not.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
their	1
soul!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
rewarded	1
evil	1
unto	1
themselves.	1
	1
3:10	1
Say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
righteous,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked!	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
ill	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
3:12	1
As	1
for	1
my	1
people,	1
children	1
are	1
their	1
oppressors,	1
and	1
women	1
rule	1
over	1
them.	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
they	1
which	1
lead	1
thee	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
paths.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
standeth	1
up	1
to	1
plead,	1
and	1
standeth	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
judgment	1
with	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
eaten	1
up	1
the	1
vineyard;	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
houses.	1
	1
3:15	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
that	1
ye	1
beat	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
grind	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
poor?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:16	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Because	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion	1
are	1
haughty,	1
and	1
walk	1
with	1
stretched	1
forth	1
necks	1
and	1
wanton	1
eyes,	1
walking	1
and	1
mincing	1
as	1
they	1
go,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
tinkling	1
with	1
their	1
feet:	1
3:17	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
with	1
a	1
scab	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
discover	1
their	1
secret	1
parts.	1
	1
3:18	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
bravery	1
of	1
their	1
tinkling	1
ornaments	1
about	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
cauls,	1
and	1
their	1
round	1
tires	1
like	1
the	1
moon,	1
3:19	1
The	1
chains,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
the	1
mufflers,	1
3:20	1
The	1
bonnets,	1
and	1
the	1
ornaments	1
of	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
the	1
headbands,	1
and	1
the	1
tablets,	1
and	1
the	1
earrings,	1
3:21	1
The	1
rings,	1
and	1
nose	1
jewels,	1
3:22	1
The	1
changeable	1
suits	1
of	1
apparel,	1
and	1
the	1
mantles,	1
and	1
the	1
wimples,	1
and	1
the	1
crisping	1
pins,	1
3:23	1
The	1
glasses,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
the	1
hoods,	1
and	1
the	1
vails.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
sweet	1
smell	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
stink;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
girdle	1
a	1
rent;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
well	1
set	1
hair	1
baldness;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
stomacher	1
a	1
girding	1
of	1
sackcloth;	1
and	1
burning	1
instead	1
of	1
beauty.	1
	1
3:25	1
Thy	1
men	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
her	1
gates	1
shall	1
lament	1
and	1
mourn;	1
and	1
she	1
being	1
desolate	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
seven	1
women	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
eat	1
our	1
own	1
bread,	1
and	1
wear	1
our	1
own	1
apparel:	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
reproach.	1
	1
4:2	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
beautiful	1
and	1
glorious,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
excellent	1
and	1
comely	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
holy,	1
even	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
among	1
the	1
living	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
4:4	1
When	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
have	1
washed	1
away	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
purged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
burning.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
create	1
upon	1
every	1
dwelling	1
place	1
of	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
assemblies,	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
smoke	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
shining	1
of	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire	1
by	1
night:	1
for	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
defence.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
a	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time	1
from	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
refuge,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
covert	1
from	1
storm	1
and	1
from	1
rain.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
to	1
my	1
wellbeloved	1
a	1
song	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
touching	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
My	1
wellbeloved	1
hath	1
a	1
vineyard	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
fruitful	1
hill:	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
fenced	1
it,	1
and	1
gathered	1
out	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof,	1
and	1
planted	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
vine,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
also	1
made	1
a	1
winepress	1
therein:	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
grapes,	1
and	1
it	1
brought	1
forth	1
wild	1
grapes.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
judge,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
5:4	1
What	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
vineyard,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
it?	1
wherefore,	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
grapes,	1
brought	1
it	1
forth	1
wild	1
grapes?	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
now	1
go	1
to;	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
my	1
vineyard:	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
hedge	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
up;	1
and	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down:	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
it	1
waste:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
pruned,	1
nor	1
digged;	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
command	1
the	1
clouds	1
that	1
they	1
rain	1
no	1
rain	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
his	1
pleasant	1
plant:	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
judgment,	1
but	1
behold	1
oppression;	1
for	1
righteousness,	1
but	1
behold	1
a	1
cry.	1
	1
5:8	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
join	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
that	1
lay	1
field	1
to	1
field,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
placed	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth!	1
	1
5:9	1
In	1
mine	1
ears	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
many	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
even	1
great	1
and	1
fair,	1
without	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
5:10	1
Yea,	1
ten	1
acres	1
of	1
vineyard	1
shall	1
yield	1
one	1
bath,	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
an	1
homer	1
shall	1
yield	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
5:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
follow	1
strong	1
drink;	1
that	1
continue	1
until	1
night,	1
till	1
wine	1
inflame	1
them!	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
harp,	1
and	1
the	1
viol,	1
the	1
tabret,	1
and	1
pipe,	1
and	1
wine,	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
feasts:	1
but	1
they	1
regard	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
consider	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
5:13	1
Therefore	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge:	1
and	1
their	1
honourable	1
men	1
are	1
famished,	1
and	1
their	1
multitude	1
dried	1
up	1
with	1
thirst.	1
	1
5:14	1
Therefore	1
hell	1
hath	1
enlarged	1
herself,	1
and	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
without	1
measure:	1
and	1
their	1
glory,	1
and	1
their	1
multitude,	1
and	1
their	1
pomp,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
rejoiceth,	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
mean	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
lofty	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled:	1
5:16	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
holy	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
lambs	1
feed	1
after	1
their	1
manner,	1
and	1
the	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
ones	1
shall	1
strangers	1
eat.	1
	1
5:18	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
draw	1
iniquity	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
vanity,	1
and	1
sin	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
with	1
a	1
cart	1
rope:	1
5:19	1
That	1
say,	1
Let	1
him	1
make	1
speed,	1
and	1
hasten	1
his	1
work,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
it:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
draw	1
nigh	1
and	1
come,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
it!	1
	1
5:20	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
evil	1
good,	1
and	1
good	1
evil;	1
that	1
put	1
darkness	1
for	1
light,	1
and	1
light	1
for	1
darkness;	1
that	1
put	1
bitter	1
for	1
sweet,	1
and	1
sweet	1
for	1
bitter!	1
	1
5:21	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
prudent	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
sight!	1
	1
5:22	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
mighty	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
strength	1
to	1
mingle	1
strong	1
drink:	1
5:23	1
Which	1
justify	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
from	1
him!	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
consumeth	1
the	1
chaff,	1
so	1
their	1
root	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
rottenness,	1
and	1
their	1
blossom	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
as	1
dust:	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
despised	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:25	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
kindled	1
against	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
hath	1
smitten	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
did	1
tremble,	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
were	1
torn	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
to	1
the	1
nations	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
will	1
hiss	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
speed	1
swiftly:	1
5:27	1
None	1
shall	1
be	1
weary	1
nor	1
stumble	1
among	1
them;	1
none	1
shall	1
slumber	1
nor	1
sleep;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
their	1
loins	1
be	1
loosed,	1
nor	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
their	1
shoes	1
be	1
broken:	1
5:28	1
Whose	1
arrows	1
are	1
sharp,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
bows	1
bent,	1
their	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
like	1
flint,	1
and	1
their	1
wheels	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind:	1
5:29	1
Their	1
roaring	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
young	1
lions:	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
roar,	1
and	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
it	1
away	1
safe,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
roar	1
against	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
if	1
one	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
behold	1
darkness	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
darkened	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:1	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
king	1
Uzziah	1
died	1
I	1
saw	1
also	1
the	1
LORD	1
sitting	1
upon	1
a	1
throne,	1
high	1
and	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
train	1
filled	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
6:2	1
Above	1
it	1
stood	1
the	1
seraphims:	1
each	1
one	1
had	1
six	1
wings;	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
with	1
twain	1
he	1
did	1
fly.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
one	1
cried	1
unto	1
another,	1
and	1
said,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
posts	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
undone;	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips,	1
and	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
unclean	1
lips:	1
for	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:6	1
Then	1
flew	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seraphims	1
unto	1
me,	1
having	1
a	1
live	1
coal	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar:	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
this	1
hath	1
touched	1
thy	1
lips;	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
thy	1
sin	1
purged.	1
	1
6:8	1
Also	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
send,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
us?	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go,	1
and	1
tell	1
this	1
people,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
indeed,	1
but	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
see	1
ye	1
indeed,	1
but	1
perceive	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
Make	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
fat,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
ears	1
heavy,	1
and	1
shut	1
their	1
eyes;	1
lest	1
they	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
convert,	1
and	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
long?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Until	1
the	1
cities	1
be	1
wasted	1
without	1
inhabitant,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
without	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
be	1
utterly	1
desolate,	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
removed	1
men	1
far	1
away,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
forsaking	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
6:13	1
But	1
yet	1
in	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
tenth,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
as	1
a	1
teil	1
tree,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
oak,	1
whose	1
substance	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
leaves:	1
so	1
the	1
holy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
substance	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
Rezin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
it,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Syria	1
is	1
confederate	1
with	1
Ephraim.	1
And	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
as	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
are	1
moved	1
with	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
7:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Isaiah,	1
Go	1
forth	1
now	1
to	1
meet	1
Ahaz,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Shearjashub	1
thy	1
son,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conduit	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's	1
field;	1
7:4	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
be	1
quiet;	1
fear	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
fainthearted	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
tails	1
of	1
these	1
smoking	1
firebrands,	1
for	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
Rezin	1
with	1
Syria,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah.	1
	1
7:5	1
Because	1
Syria,	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
have	1
taken	1
evil	1
counsel	1
against	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
7:6	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
vex	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
breach	1
therein	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
even	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tabeal:	1
7:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
stand,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Syria	1
is	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Damascus	1
is	1
Rezin;	1
and	1
within	1
threescore	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
shall	1
Ephraim	1
be	1
broken,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
a	1
people.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Samaria	1
is	1
Remaliah's	1
son.	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe,	1
surely	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
7:10	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
again	1
unto	1
Ahaz,	1
saying,	1
7:11	1
Ask	1
thee	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
ask	1
it	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
depth,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
above.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
Ahaz	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
ask,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
tempt	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
now,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
weary	1
men,	1
but	1
will	1
ye	1
weary	1
my	1
God	1
also?	1
	1
7:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
sign;	1
Behold,	1
a	1
virgin	1
shall	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shall	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Immanuel.	1
	1
7:15	1
Butter	1
and	1
honey	1
shall	1
he	1
eat,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
know	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
good.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
know	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
good,	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
thou	1
abhorrest	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken	1
of	1
both	1
her	1
kings.	1
	1
7:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
days	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
come,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Ephraim	1
departed	1
from	1
Judah;	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
hiss	1
for	1
the	1
fly	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
bee	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
shall	1
rest	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
desolate	1
valleys,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
holes	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
thorns,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
bushes.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
shave	1
with	1
a	1
razor	1
that	1
is	1
hired,	1
namely,	1
by	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
by	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
the	1
feet:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
consume	1
the	1
beard.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
nourish	1
a	1
young	1
cow,	1
and	1
two	1
sheep;	1
7:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
for	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
milk	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
butter:	1
for	1
butter	1
and	1
honey	1
shall	1
every	1
one	1
eat	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
every	1
place	1
shall	1
be,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
vines	1
at	1
a	1
thousand	1
silverlings,	1
it	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
for	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns.	1
	1
7:24	1
With	1
arrows	1
and	1
with	1
bows	1
shall	1
men	1
come	1
thither;	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
become	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
on	1
all	1
hills	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
digged	1
with	1
the	1
mattock,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
thither	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns:	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
sending	1
forth	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
treading	1
of	1
lesser	1
cattle.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
roll,	1
and	1
write	1
in	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
man's	1
pen	1
concerning	1
Mahershalalhashbaz.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
unto	1
me	1
faithful	1
witnesses	1
to	1
record,	1
Uriah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeberechiah.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
prophetess;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
me,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Mahershalalhashbaz.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
before	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
have	1
knowledge	1
to	1
cry,	1
My	1
father,	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
Damascus	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
8:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
spake	1
also	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
saying,	1
8:6	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
people	1
refuseth	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Shiloah	1
that	1
go	1
softly,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Rezin	1
and	1
Remaliah's	1
son;	1
8:7	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
bringeth	1
up	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
strong	1
and	1
many,	1
even	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
channels,	1
and	1
go	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
banks:	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Judah;	1
he	1
shall	1
overflow	1
and	1
go	1
over,	1
he	1
shall	1
reach	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
neck;	1
and	1
the	1
stretching	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wings	1
shall	1
fill	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
O	1
Immanuel.	1
	1
8:9	1
Associate	1
yourselves,	1
O	1
ye	1
people,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
far	1
countries:	1
gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
8:10	1
Take	1
counsel	1
together,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought;	1
speak	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
8:11	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
thus	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
instructed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
people,	1
saying,	1
8:12	1
Say	1
ye	1
not,	1
A	1
confederacy,	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
say,	1
A	1
confederacy;	1
neither	1
fear	1
ye	1
their	1
fear,	1
nor	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
8:13	1
Sanctify	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
himself;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
fear,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
dread.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sanctuary;	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence	1
to	1
both	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Israel,	1
for	1
a	1
gin	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
many	1
among	1
them	1
shall	1
stumble,	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
be	1
snared,	1
and	1
be	1
taken.	1
	1
8:16	1
Bind	1
up	1
the	1
testimony,	1
seal	1
the	1
law	1
among	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hideth	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
8:18	1
Behold,	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
for	1
signs	1
and	1
for	1
wonders	1
in	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Seek	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
unto	1
wizards	1
that	1
peep,	1
and	1
that	1
mutter:	1
should	1
not	1
a	1
people	1
seek	1
unto	1
their	1
God?	1
for	1
the	1
living	1
to	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
8:20	1
To	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
testimony:	1
if	1
they	1
speak	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it,	1
hardly	1
bestead	1
and	1
hungry:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
hungry,	1
they	1
shall	1
fret	1
themselves,	1
and	1
curse	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
look	1
upward.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble	1
and	1
darkness,	1
dimness	1
of	1
anguish;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
darkness.	1
	1
9:1	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
dimness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
vexation,	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
lightly	1
afflicted	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
afterward	1
did	1
more	1
grievously	1
afflict	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
in	1
Galilee	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
9:2	1
The	1
people	1
that	1
walked	1
in	1
darkness	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
light:	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
upon	1
them	1
hath	1
the	1
light	1
shined.	1
	1
9:3	1
Thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
not	1
increased	1
the	1
joy:	1
they	1
joy	1
before	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
joy	1
in	1
harvest,	1
and	1
as	1
men	1
rejoice	1
when	1
they	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
9:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
his	1
burden,	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
oppressor,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
every	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
warrior	1
is	1
with	1
confused	1
noise,	1
and	1
garments	1
rolled	1
in	1
blood;	1
but	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
burning	1
and	1
fuel	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
9:6	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
child	1
is	1
born,	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
son	1
is	1
given:	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Wonderful,	1
Counsellor,	1
The	1
mighty	1
God,	1
The	1
everlasting	1
Father,	1
The	1
Prince	1
of	1
Peace.	1
	1
9:7	1
Of	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
and	1
peace	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end,	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
order	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
it	1
with	1
judgment	1
and	1
with	1
justice	1
from	1
henceforth	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
will	1
perform	1
this.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
sent	1
a	1
word	1
into	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
lighted	1
upon	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
know,	1
even	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
that	1
say	1
in	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
stoutness	1
of	1
heart,	1
9:10	1
The	1
bricks	1
are	1
fallen	1
down,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
build	1
with	1
hewn	1
stones:	1
the	1
sycomores	1
are	1
cut	1
down,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
change	1
them	1
into	1
cedars.	1
	1
9:11	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
Rezin	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
join	1
his	1
enemies	1
together;	1
9:12	1
The	1
Syrians	1
before,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
behind;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour	1
Israel	1
with	1
open	1
mouth.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
turneth	1
not	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
them,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
9:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel	1
head	1
and	1
tail,	1
branch	1
and	1
rush,	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
ancient	1
and	1
honourable,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head;	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
teacheth	1
lies,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
tail.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
err;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
led	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
	1
9:17	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
joy	1
in	1
their	1
young	1
men,	1
neither	1
shall	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
their	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
is	1
an	1
hypocrite	1
and	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
and	1
every	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
folly.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
9:18	1
For	1
wickedness	1
burneth	1
as	1
the	1
fire:	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns,	1
and	1
shall	1
kindle	1
in	1
the	1
thickets	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
mount	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
lifting	1
up	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
9:19	1
Through	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
fuel	1
of	1
the	1
fire:	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
spare	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
snatch	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
be	1
hungry;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
arm:	1
9:21	1
Manasseh,	1
Ephraim;	1
and	1
Ephraim,	1
Manasseh:	1
and	1
they	1
together	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
Judah.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
10:1	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
decree	1
unrighteous	1
decrees,	1
and	1
that	1
write	1
grievousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
prescribed;	1
10:2	1
To	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
needy	1
from	1
judgment,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
right	1
from	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
widows	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
prey,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rob	1
the	1
fatherless!	1
10:3	1
And	1
what	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
desolation	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far?	1
to	1
whom	1
will	1
ye	1
flee	1
for	1
help?	1
and	1
where	1
will	1
ye	1
leave	1
your	1
glory?	1
	1
10:4	1
Without	1
me	1
they	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
slain.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
anger	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
away,	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
still.	1
	1
10:5	1
O	1
Assyrian,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
is	1
mine	1
indignation.	1
	1
10:6	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
against	1
an	1
hypocritical	1
nation,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
wrath	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
charge,	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
to	1
tread	1
them	1
down	1
like	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
10:7	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
meaneth	1
not	1
so,	1
neither	1
doth	1
his	1
heart	1
think	1
so;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
destroy	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
nations	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
he	1
saith,	1
Are	1
not	1
my	1
princes	1
altogether	1
kings?	1
	1
10:9	1
Is	1
not	1
Calno	1
as	1
Carchemish?	1
is	1
not	1
Hamath	1
as	1
Arpad?	1
is	1
not	1
Samaria	1
as	1
Damascus?	1
	1
10:10	1
As	1
my	1
hand	1
hath	1
found	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
whose	1
graven	1
images	1
did	1
excel	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
10:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
not,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
Samaria	1
and	1
her	1
idols,	1
so	1
do	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
her	1
idols?	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
performed	1
his	1
whole	1
work	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zion	1
and	1
on	1
Jerusalem,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
stout	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
high	1
looks.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
he	1
saith,	1
By	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
wisdom;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
prudent:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
removed	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
have	1
robbed	1
their	1
treasures,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
like	1
a	1
valiant	1
man:	1
10:14	1
And	1
my	1
hand	1
hath	1
found	1
as	1
a	1
nest	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
as	1
one	1
gathereth	1
eggs	1
that	1
are	1
left,	1
have	1
I	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
moved	1
the	1
wing,	1
or	1
opened	1
the	1
mouth,	1
or	1
peeped.	1
	1
10:15	1
Shall	1
the	1
axe	1
boast	1
itself	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
heweth	1
therewith?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
saw	1
magnify	1
itself	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
shaketh	1
it?	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
rod	1
should	1
shake	1
itself	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
lift	1
it	1
up,	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
staff	1
should	1
lift	1
up	1
itself,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
no	1
wood.	1
	1
10:16	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
hosts,	1
send	1
among	1
his	1
fat	1
ones	1
leanness;	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
glory	1
he	1
shall	1
kindle	1
a	1
burning	1
like	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
a	1
fire.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
Holy	1
One	1
for	1
a	1
flame:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
burn	1
and	1
devour	1
his	1
thorns	1
and	1
his	1
briers	1
in	1
one	1
day;	1
10:18	1
And	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
forest,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
standard-bearer	1
fainteth.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
his	1
forest	1
shall	1
be	1
few,	1
that	1
a	1
child	1
may	1
write	1
them.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
again	1
stay	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
them;	1
but	1
shall	1
stay	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
10:21	1
The	1
remnant	1
shall	1
return,	1
even	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
unto	1
the	1
mighty	1
God.	1
	1
10:22	1
For	1
though	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
return:	1
the	1
consumption	1
decreed	1
shall	1
overflow	1
with	1
righteousness.	1
	1
10:23	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
consumption,	1
even	1
determined,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
10:24	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
O	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
Zion,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrian:	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
and	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
staff	1
against	1
thee,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:25	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
indignation	1
shall	1
cease,	1
and	1
mine	1
anger	1
in	1
their	1
destruction.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
a	1
scourge	1
for	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
Midian	1
at	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
Oreb:	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
rod	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
lift	1
it	1
up	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
his	1
burden	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
the	1
yoke	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
anointing.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
Aiath,	1
he	1
is	1
passed	1
to	1
Migron;	1
at	1
Michmash	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
up	1
his	1
carriages:	1
10:29	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
passage:	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
lodging	1
at	1
Geba;	1
Ramah	1
is	1
afraid;	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul	1
is	1
fled.	1
	1
10:30	1
Lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Gallim:	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
unto	1
Laish,	1
O	1
poor	1
Anathoth.	1
	1
10:31	1
Madmenah	1
is	1
removed;	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gebim	1
gather	1
themselves	1
to	1
flee.	1
	1
10:32	1
As	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
remain	1
at	1
Nob	1
that	1
day:	1
he	1
shall	1
shake	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:33	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
lop	1
the	1
bough	1
with	1
terror:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
ones	1
of	1
stature	1
shall	1
be	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
haughty	1
shall	1
be	1
humbled.	1
	1
10:34	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
thickets	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
with	1
iron,	1
and	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
a	1
mighty	1
one.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
a	1
rod	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stem	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
a	1
Branch	1
shall	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
roots:	1
11:2	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
him,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
counsel	1
and	1
might,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
11:3	1
And	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
of	1
quick	1
understanding	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
neither	1
reprove	1
after	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
his	1
ears:	1
11:4	1
But	1
with	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
he	1
judge	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
reprove	1
with	1
equity	1
for	1
the	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
earth:	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
shall	1
he	1
slay	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
faithfulness	1
the	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
reins.	1
	1
11:6	1
The	1
wolf	1
also	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
leopard	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
kid;	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
fatling	1
together;	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
lead	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1
cow	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
shall	1
feed;	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
shall	1
eat	1
straw	1
like	1
the	1
ox.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
sucking	1
child	1
shall	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
asp,	1
and	1
the	1
weaned	1
child	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
cockatrice'	1
den.	1
	1
11:9	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
nor	1
destroy	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
which	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
an	1
ensign	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
to	1
it	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
seek:	1
and	1
his	1
rest	1
shall	1
be	1
glorious.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
set	1
his	1
hand	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
recover	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
from	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
from	1
Pathros,	1
and	1
from	1
Cush,	1
and	1
from	1
Elam,	1
and	1
from	1
Shinar,	1
and	1
from	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
islands	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
for	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
shall	1
assemble	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
dispersed	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:13	1
The	1
envy	1
also	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
depart,	1
and	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
not	1
envy	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Judah	1
shall	1
not	1
vex	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
11:14	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
fly	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
toward	1
the	1
west;	1
they	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
together:	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hand	1
upon	1
Edom	1
and	1
Moab;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
shall	1
obey	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
sea;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
wind	1
shall	1
he	1
shake	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
streams,	1
and	1
make	1
men	1
go	1
over	1
dryshod.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
highway	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
from	1
Assyria;	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thee:	1
though	1
thou	1
wast	1
angry	1
with	1
me,	1
thine	1
anger	1
is	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
thou	1
comfortedst	1
me.	1
	1
12:2	1
Behold,	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
salvation;	1
I	1
will	1
trust,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
afraid:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
JEHOVAH	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
my	1
song;	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore	1
with	1
joy	1
shall	1
ye	1
draw	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
ye	1
say,	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
name,	1
declare	1
his	1
doings	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
make	1
mention	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
exalted.	1
	1
12:5	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
excellent	1
things:	1
this	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:6	1
Cry	1
out	1
and	1
shout,	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
13:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
which	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
did	1
see.	1
	1
13:2	1
Lift	1
ye	1
up	1
a	1
banner	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
mountain,	1
exalt	1
the	1
voice	1
unto	1
them,	1
shake	1
the	1
hand,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
nobles.	1
	1
13:3	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
my	1
sanctified	1
ones,	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
called	1
my	1
mighty	1
ones	1
for	1
mine	1
anger,	1
even	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
highness.	1
	1
13:4	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
multitude	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
people;	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
nations	1
gathered	1
together:	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
mustereth	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
13:5	1
They	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
his	1
indignation,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
whole	1
land.	1
	1
13:6	1
Howl	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty.	1
	1
13:7	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
all	1
hands	1
be	1
faint,	1
and	1
every	1
man's	1
heart	1
shall	1
melt:	1
13:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid:	1
pangs	1
and	1
sorrows	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
pain	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
travaileth:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
amazed	1
one	1
at	1
another;	1
their	1
faces	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
flames.	1
	1
13:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
cruel	1
both	1
with	1
wrath	1
and	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
land	1
desolate:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
sinners	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:10	1
For	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
constellations	1
thereof	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
their	1
light:	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened	1
in	1
his	1
going	1
forth,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
cause	1
her	1
light	1
to	1
shine.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
their	1
evil,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
arrogancy	1
of	1
the	1
proud	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
will	1
lay	1
low	1
the	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
the	1
terrible.	1
	1
13:12	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
fine	1
gold;	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
the	1
golden	1
wedge	1
of	1
Ophir.	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
remove	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
chased	1
roe,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
up:	1
they	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
turn	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
people,	1
and	1
flee	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
13:15	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
found	1
shall	1
be	1
thrust	1
through;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
them	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
13:16	1
Their	1
children	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
dashed	1
to	1
pieces	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
ravished.	1
	1
13:17	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
Medes	1
against	1
them,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
regard	1
silver;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
gold,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
delight	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
Their	1
bows	1
also	1
shall	1
dash	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
pieces;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
womb;	1
their	1
eyes	1
shall	1
not	1
spare	1
children.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Babylon,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees'	1
excellency,	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
13:20	1
It	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
dwelt	1
in	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation:	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
Arabian	1
pitch	1
tent	1
there;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
shepherds	1
make	1
their	1
fold	1
there.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
lie	1
there;	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
doleful	1
creatures;	1
and	1
owls	1
shall	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
satyrs	1
shall	1
dance	1
there.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
islands	1
shall	1
cry	1
in	1
their	1
desolate	1
houses,	1
and	1
dragons	1
in	1
their	1
pleasant	1
palaces:	1
and	1
her	1
time	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
her	1
days	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
prolonged.	1
	1
14:1	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
will	1
yet	1
choose	1
Israel,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land:	1
and	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
take	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
place:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
possess	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
servants	1
and	1
handmaids:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
captives,	1
whose	1
captives	1
they	1
were;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
their	1
oppressors.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
rest	1
from	1
thy	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
fear,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hard	1
bondage	1
wherein	1
thou	1
wast	1
made	1
to	1
serve,	1
14:4	1
That	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
up	1
this	1
proverb	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
say,	1
How	1
hath	1
the	1
oppressor	1
ceased!	1
the	1
golden	1
city	1
ceased!	1
	1
14:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
broken	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
the	1
rulers.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
who	1
smote	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
wrath	1
with	1
a	1
continual	1
stroke,	1
he	1
that	1
ruled	1
the	1
nations	1
in	1
anger,	1
is	1
persecuted,	1
and	1
none	1
hindereth.	1
	1
14:7	1
The	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
at	1
rest,	1
and	1
is	1
quiet:	1
they	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing.	1
	1
14:8	1
Yea,	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
rejoice	1
at	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
saying,	1
Since	1
thou	1
art	1
laid	1
down,	1
no	1
feller	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Hell	1
from	1
beneath	1
is	1
moved	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
meet	1
thee	1
at	1
thy	1
coming:	1
it	1
stirreth	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
for	1
thee,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
ones	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
it	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
their	1
thrones	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
14:10	1
All	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
become	1
weak	1
as	1
we?	1
art	1
thou	1
become	1
like	1
unto	1
us?	1
	1
14:11	1
Thy	1
pomp	1
is	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
viols:	1
the	1
worm	1
is	1
spread	1
under	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
worms	1
cover	1
thee.	1
	1
14:12	1
How	1
art	1
thou	1
fallen	1
from	1
heaven,	1
O	1
Lucifer,	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
morning!	1
how	1
art	1
thou	1
cut	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
didst	1
weaken	1
the	1
nations!	1
14:13	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven,	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
my	1
throne	1
above	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
sit	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
14:14	1
I	1
will	1
ascend	1
above	1
the	1
heights	1
of	1
the	1
clouds;	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
most	1
High.	1
	1
14:15	1
Yet	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
14:16	1
They	1
that	1
see	1
thee	1
shall	1
narrowly	1
look	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
consider	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
tremble,	1
that	1
did	1
shake	1
kingdoms;	1
14:17	1
That	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof;	1
that	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
prisoners?	1
	1
14:18	1
All	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
even	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
lie	1
in	1
glory,	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
14:19	1
But	1
thou	1
art	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
grave	1
like	1
an	1
abominable	1
branch,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
slain,	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
pit;	1
as	1
a	1
carcase	1
trodden	1
under	1
feet.	1
	1
14:20	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
joined	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
burial,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
slain	1
thy	1
people:	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
evildoers	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
renowned.	1
	1
14:21	1
Prepare	1
slaughter	1
for	1
his	1
children	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers;	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
rise,	1
nor	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
nor	1
fill	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
cities.	1
	1
14:22	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Babylon	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
remnant,	1
and	1
son,	1
and	1
nephew,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:23	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
possession	1
for	1
the	1
bittern,	1
and	1
pools	1
of	1
water:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sweep	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
besom	1
of	1
destruction,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
14:24	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sworn,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
thought,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
purposed,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
stand:	1
14:25	1
That	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
in	1
my	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
mountains	1
tread	1
him	1
under	1
foot:	1
then	1
shall	1
his	1
yoke	1
depart	1
from	1
off	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
burden	1
depart	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
14:26	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
purpose	1
that	1
is	1
purposed	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
is	1
stretched	1
out	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
14:27	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
disannul	1
it?	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
stretched	1
out,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
turn	1
it	1
back?	1
	1
14:28	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
died	1
was	1
this	1
burden.	1
	1
14:29	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
thou,	1
whole	1
Palestina,	1
because	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
thee	1
is	1
broken:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
serpent's	1
root	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
a	1
cockatrice,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fiery	1
flying	1
serpent.	1
	1
14:30	1
And	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
feed,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
safety:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
thy	1
root	1
with	1
famine,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
thy	1
remnant.	1
	1
14:31	1
Howl,	1
O	1
gate;	1
cry,	1
O	1
city;	1
thou,	1
whole	1
Palestina,	1
art	1
dissolved:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
a	1
smoke,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
alone	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
times.	1
	1
14:32	1
What	1
shall	1
one	1
then	1
answer	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
nation?	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
founded	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
15:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Moab.	1
Because	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
Ar	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
silence;	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
Kir	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
silence;	1
15:2	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Bajith,	1
and	1
to	1
Dibon,	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
to	1
weep:	1
Moab	1
shall	1
howl	1
over	1
Nebo,	1
and	1
over	1
Medeba:	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
heads	1
shall	1
be	1
baldness,	1
and	1
every	1
beard	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
15:3	1
In	1
their	1
streets	1
they	1
shall	1
gird	1
themselves	1
with	1
sackcloth:	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
their	1
houses,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
streets,	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
howl,	1
weeping	1
abundantly.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Heshbon	1
shall	1
cry,	1
and	1
Elealeh:	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
even	1
unto	1
Jahaz:	1
therefore	1
the	1
armed	1
soldiers	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
cry	1
out;	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
grievous	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:5	1
My	1
heart	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
for	1
Moab;	1
his	1
fugitives	1
shall	1
flee	1
unto	1
Zoar,	1
an	1
heifer	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
mounting	1
up	1
of	1
Luhith	1
with	1
weeping	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
it	1
up;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Horonaim	1
they	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
destruction.	1
	1
15:6	1
For	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Nimrim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate:	1
for	1
the	1
hay	1
is	1
withered	1
away,	1
the	1
grass	1
faileth,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
green	1
thing.	1
	1
15:7	1
Therefore	1
the	1
abundance	1
they	1
have	1
gotten,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
up,	1
shall	1
they	1
carry	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
the	1
willows.	1
	1
15:8	1
For	1
the	1
cry	1
is	1
gone	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Moab;	1
the	1
howling	1
thereof	1
unto	1
Eglaim,	1
and	1
the	1
howling	1
thereof	1
unto	1
Beerelim.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Dimon	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
blood:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
more	1
upon	1
Dimon,	1
lions	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
escapeth	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
16:1	1
Send	1
ye	1
the	1
lamb	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
Sela	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
16:2	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
wandering	1
bird	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nest,	1
so	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
fords	1
of	1
Arnon.	1
	1
16:3	1
Take	1
counsel,	1
execute	1
judgment;	1
make	1
thy	1
shadow	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
noonday;	1
hide	1
the	1
outcasts;	1
bewray	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
wandereth.	1
	1
16:4	1
Let	1
mine	1
outcasts	1
dwell	1
with	1
thee,	1
Moab;	1
be	1
thou	1
a	1
covert	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
spoiler:	1
for	1
the	1
extortioner	1
is	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
the	1
spoiler	1
ceaseth,	1
the	1
oppressors	1
are	1
consumed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
in	1
mercy	1
shall	1
the	1
throne	1
be	1
established:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
it	1
in	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
judging,	1
and	1
seeking	1
judgment,	1
and	1
hasting	1
righteousness.	1
	1
16:6	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Moab;	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
proud:	1
even	1
of	1
his	1
haughtiness,	1
and	1
his	1
pride,	1
and	1
his	1
wrath:	1
but	1
his	1
lies	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
16:7	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
Moab	1
howl	1
for	1
Moab,	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
howl:	1
for	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
Kirhareseth	1
shall	1
ye	1
mourn;	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
stricken.	1
	1
16:8	1
For	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
languish,	1
and	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
Sibmah:	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
have	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
principal	1
plants	1
thereof,	1
they	1
are	1
come	1
even	1
unto	1
Jazer,	1
they	1
wandered	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
her	1
branches	1
are	1
stretched	1
out,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:9	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
bewail	1
with	1
the	1
weeping	1
of	1
Jazer	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
Sibmah:	1
I	1
will	1
water	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
tears,	1
O	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
Elealeh:	1
for	1
the	1
shouting	1
for	1
thy	1
summer	1
fruits	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
harvest	1
is	1
fallen.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
gladness	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
joy	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plentiful	1
field;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
singing,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
shouting:	1
the	1
treaders	1
shall	1
tread	1
out	1
no	1
wine	1
in	1
their	1
presses;	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
vintage	1
shouting	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
16:11	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
bowels	1
shall	1
sound	1
like	1
an	1
harp	1
for	1
Moab,	1
and	1
mine	1
inward	1
parts	1
for	1
Kirharesh.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
seen	1
that	1
Moab	1
is	1
weary	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
place,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
sanctuary	1
to	1
pray;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail.	1
	1
16:13	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
Moab	1
since	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
16:14	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
saying,	1
Within	1
three	1
years,	1
as	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
contemned,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
great	1
multitude;	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
feeble.	1
	1
17:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Damascus.	1
Behold,	1
Damascus	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
ruinous	1
heap.	1
	1
17:2	1
The	1
cities	1
of	1
Aroer	1
are	1
forsaken:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
flocks,	1
which	1
shall	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:3	1
The	1
fortress	1
also	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Syria:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
thin,	1
and	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
wax	1
lean.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
harvestman	1
gathereth	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
reapeth	1
the	1
ears	1
with	1
his	1
arm;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
ears	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
17:6	1
Yet	1
gleaning	1
grapes	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
an	1
olive	1
tree,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
berries	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
uppermost	1
bough,	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
outmost	1
fruitful	1
branches	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:7	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
look	1
to	1
his	1
Maker,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
shall	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
altars,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
neither	1
shall	1
respect	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
fingers	1
have	1
made,	1
either	1
the	1
groves,	1
or	1
the	1
images.	1
	1
17:9	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
his	1
strong	1
cities	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
forsaken	1
bough,	1
and	1
an	1
uppermost	1
branch,	1
which	1
they	1
left	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
desolation.	1
	1
17:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
thy	1
strength,	1
therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
plant	1
pleasant	1
plants,	1
and	1
shalt	1
set	1
it	1
with	1
strange	1
slips:	1
17:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thy	1
plant	1
to	1
grow,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
flourish:	1
but	1
the	1
harvest	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
heap	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
of	1
desperate	1
sorrow.	1
	1
17:12	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
which	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
nations,	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
rushing	1
like	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
mighty	1
waters!	1
	1
17:13	1
The	1
nations	1
shall	1
rush	1
like	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
many	1
waters:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
rebuke	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
chased	1
as	1
the	1
chaff	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
before	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
rolling	1
thing	1
before	1
the	1
whirlwind.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
behold	1
at	1
eveningtide	1
trouble;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
spoil	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rob	1
us.	1
	1
18:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
shadowing	1
with	1
wings,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Ethiopia:	1
18:2	1
That	1
sendeth	1
ambassadors	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
bulrushes	1
upon	1
the	1
waters,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
ye	1
swift	1
messengers,	1
to	1
a	1
nation	1
scattered	1
and	1
peeled,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
terrible	1
from	1
their	1
beginning	1
hitherto;	1
a	1
nation	1
meted	1
out	1
and	1
trodden	1
down,	1
whose	1
land	1
the	1
rivers	1
have	1
spoiled!	1
	1
18:3	1
All	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
dwellers	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
see	1
ye,	1
when	1
he	1
lifteth	1
up	1
an	1
ensign	1
on	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
bloweth	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
hear	1
ye.	1
	1
18:4	1
For	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
my	1
rest,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consider	1
in	1
my	1
dwelling	1
place	1
like	1
a	1
clear	1
heat	1
upon	1
herbs,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
dew	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
harvest.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
afore	1
the	1
harvest,	1
when	1
the	1
bud	1
is	1
perfect,	1
and	1
the	1
sour	1
grape	1
is	1
ripening	1
in	1
the	1
flower,	1
he	1
shall	1
both	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
sprigs	1
with	1
pruning	1
hooks,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
18:6	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
shall	1
summer	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
winter	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
18:7	1
In	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
the	1
present	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
scattered	1
and	1
peeled,	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
people	1
terrible	1
from	1
their	1
beginning	1
hitherto;	1
a	1
nation	1
meted	1
out	1
and	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot,	1
whose	1
land	1
the	1
rivers	1
have	1
spoiled,	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
19:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
rideth	1
upon	1
a	1
swift	1
cloud,	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
at	1
his	1
presence,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
melt	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
against	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
city	1
against	1
city,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
fail	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
counsel	1
thereof:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
charmers,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wizards.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
cruel	1
lord;	1
and	1
a	1
fierce	1
king	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
be	1
wasted	1
and	1
dried	1
up.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
the	1
rivers	1
far	1
away;	1
and	1
the	1
brooks	1
of	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
emptied	1
and	1
dried	1
up:	1
the	1
reeds	1
and	1
flags	1
shall	1
wither.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
paper	1
reeds	1
by	1
the	1
brooks,	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
brooks,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
sown	1
by	1
the	1
brooks,	1
shall	1
wither,	1
be	1
driven	1
away,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
19:8	1
The	1
fishers	1
also	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
cast	1
angle	1
into	1
the	1
brooks	1
shall	1
lament,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
spread	1
nets	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
languish.	1
	1
19:9	1
Moreover	1
they	1
that	1
work	1
in	1
fine	1
flax,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
weave	1
networks,	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
the	1
purposes	1
thereof,	1
all	1
that	1
make	1
sluices	1
and	1
ponds	1
for	1
fish.	1
	1
19:11	1
Surely	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Zoan	1
are	1
fools,	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
counsellors	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
is	1
become	1
brutish:	1
how	1
say	1
ye	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
ancient	1
kings?	1
	1
19:12	1
Where	1
are	1
they?	1
where	1
are	1
thy	1
wise	1
men?	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
tell	1
thee	1
now,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed	1
upon	1
Egypt.	1
	1
19:13	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Zoan	1
are	1
become	1
fools,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Noph	1
are	1
deceived;	1
they	1
have	1
also	1
seduced	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
stay	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
mingled	1
a	1
perverse	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
Egypt	1
to	1
err	1
in	1
every	1
work	1
thereof,	1
as	1
a	1
drunken	1
man	1
staggereth	1
in	1
his	1
vomit.	1
	1
19:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
work	1
for	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
the	1
head	1
or	1
tail,	1
branch	1
or	1
rush,	1
may	1
do.	1
	1
19:16	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
Egypt	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
women:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
he	1
shaketh	1
over	1
it.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
terror	1
unto	1
Egypt,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
maketh	1
mention	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
in	1
himself,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
determined	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
19:18	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
five	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
speak	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
swear	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
destruction.	1
	1
19:19	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
altar	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
a	1
pillar	1
at	1
the	1
border	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
oppressors,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
a	1
saviour,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
one,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
oblation;	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
perform	1
it.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
Egypt:	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
and	1
heal	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
intreated	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
19:23	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
highway	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
into	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
serve	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians.	1
	1
19:24	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
Israel	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
with	1
Egypt	1
and	1
with	1
Assyria,	1
even	1
a	1
blessing	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
bless,	1
saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
Egypt	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
Assyria	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
Israel	1
mine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
20:1	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
Tartan	1
came	1
unto	1
Ashdod,	1
(when	1
Sargon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
sent	1
him,)	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
took	1
it;	1
20:2	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
spake	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
loose	1
the	1
sackcloth	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoe	1
from	1
thy	1
foot.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
walking	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Like	1
as	1
my	1
servant	1
Isaiah	1
hath	1
walked	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot	1
three	1
years	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
wonder	1
upon	1
Egypt	1
and	1
upon	1
Ethiopia;	1
20:4	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
lead	1
away	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
captives,	1
young	1
and	1
old,	1
naked	1
and	1
barefoot,	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
buttocks	1
uncovered,	1
to	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
their	1
expectation,	1
and	1
of	1
Egypt	1
their	1
glory.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
this	1
isle	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Behold,	1
such	1
is	1
our	1
expectation,	1
whither	1
we	1
flee	1
for	1
help	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
escape?	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
As	1
whirlwinds	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
pass	1
through;	1
so	1
it	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
desert,	1
from	1
a	1
terrible	1
land.	1
	1
21:2	1
A	1
grievous	1
vision	1
is	1
declared	1
unto	1
me;	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealer	1
dealeth	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
the	1
spoiler	1
spoileth.	1
Go	1
up,	1
O	1
Elam:	1
besiege,	1
O	1
Media;	1
all	1
the	1
sighing	1
thereof	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
21:3	1
Therefore	1
are	1
my	1
loins	1
filled	1
with	1
pain:	1
pangs	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
travaileth:	1
I	1
was	1
bowed	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
it;	1
I	1
was	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
seeing	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:4	1
My	1
heart	1
panted,	1
fearfulness	1
affrighted	1
me:	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
my	1
pleasure	1
hath	1
he	1
turned	1
into	1
fear	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
21:5	1
Prepare	1
the	1
table,	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
watchtower,	1
eat,	1
drink:	1
arise,	1
ye	1
princes,	1
and	1
anoint	1
the	1
shield.	1
	1
21:6	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
set	1
a	1
watchman,	1
let	1
him	1
declare	1
what	1
he	1
seeth.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
chariot	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
horsemen,	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
asses,	1
and	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
camels;	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
diligently	1
with	1
much	1
heed:	1
21:8	1
And	1
he	1
cried,	1
A	1
lion:	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
stand	1
continually	1
upon	1
the	1
watchtower	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
in	1
my	1
ward	1
whole	1
nights:	1
21:9	1
And,	1
behold,	1
here	1
cometh	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
men,	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
horsemen.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
her	1
gods	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
unto	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
21:10	1
O	1
my	1
threshing,	1
and	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
my	1
floor:	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
I	1
declared	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
21:11	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Dumah.	1
He	1
calleth	1
to	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
Seir,	1
Watchman,	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
Watchman,	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
night?	1
	1
21:12	1
The	1
watchman	1
said,	1
The	1
morning	1
cometh,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
night:	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
enquire,	1
enquire	1
ye:	1
return,	1
come.	1
	1
21:13	1
The	1
burden	1
upon	1
Arabia.	1
In	1
the	1
forest	1
in	1
Arabia	1
shall	1
ye	1
lodge,	1
O	1
ye	1
travelling	1
companies	1
of	1
Dedanim.	1
	1
21:14	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tema	1
brought	1
water	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
they	1
prevented	1
with	1
their	1
bread	1
him	1
that	1
fled.	1
	1
21:15	1
For	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
swords,	1
from	1
the	1
drawn	1
sword,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
bent	1
bow,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
grievousness	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
21:16	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Within	1
a	1
year,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Kedar	1
shall	1
fail:	1
21:17	1
And	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
archers,	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Kedar,	1
shall	1
be	1
diminished:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
22:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
vision.	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee	1
now,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wholly	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
housetops?	1
	1
22:2	1
Thou	1
that	1
art	1
full	1
of	1
stirs,	1
a	1
tumultuous	1
city,	1
joyous	1
city:	1
thy	1
slain	1
men	1
are	1
not	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
nor	1
dead	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
22:3	1
All	1
thy	1
rulers	1
are	1
fled	1
together,	1
they	1
are	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
archers:	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
found	1
in	1
thee	1
are	1
bound	1
together,	1
which	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
far.	1
	1
22:4	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
Look	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
weep	1
bitterly,	1
labour	1
not	1
to	1
comfort	1
me,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
22:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
of	1
treading	1
down,	1
and	1
of	1
perplexity	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
vision,	1
breaking	1
down	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
of	1
crying	1
to	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
Elam	1
bare	1
the	1
quiver	1
with	1
chariots	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
Kir	1
uncovered	1
the	1
shield.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
thy	1
choicest	1
valleys	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
chariots,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
discovered	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
22:9	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
also	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
many:	1
and	1
ye	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
pool.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
numbered	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
have	1
ye	1
broken	1
down	1
to	1
fortify	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
22:11	1
Ye	1
made	1
also	1
a	1
ditch	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
walls	1
for	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
pool:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
looked	1
unto	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof,	1
neither	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
fashioned	1
it	1
long	1
ago.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
did	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
call	1
to	1
weeping,	1
and	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
to	1
baldness,	1
and	1
to	1
girding	1
with	1
sackcloth:	1
22:13	1
And	1
behold	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
slaying	1
oxen,	1
and	1
killing	1
sheep,	1
eating	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinking	1
wine:	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
in	1
mine	1
ears	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Surely	1
this	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
purged	1
from	1
you	1
till	1
ye	1
die,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
22:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Go,	1
get	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
treasurer,	1
even	1
unto	1
Shebna,	1
which	1
is	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
say,	1
22:16	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
here?	1
and	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
here,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hewed	1
thee	1
out	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
here,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
heweth	1
him	1
out	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
that	1
graveth	1
an	1
habitation	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
rock?	1
	1
22:17	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
carry	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
captivity,	1
and	1
will	1
surely	1
cover	1
thee.	1
	1
22:18	1
He	1
will	1
surely	1
violently	1
turn	1
and	1
toss	1
thee	1
like	1
a	1
ball	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
country:	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
die,	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
thy	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
lord's	1
house.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
station,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
state	1
shall	1
he	1
pull	1
thee	1
down.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
my	1
servant	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah:	1
22:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
clothe	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
robe,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
girdle,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
commit	1
thy	1
government	1
into	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder;	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
open,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
shut;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shut,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
open.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fasten	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
nail	1
in	1
a	1
sure	1
place;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
glorious	1
throne	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
hang	1
upon	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
the	1
offspring	1
and	1
the	1
issue,	1
all	1
vessels	1
of	1
small	1
quantity,	1
from	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
cups,	1
even	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
flagons.	1
	1
22:25	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
the	1
nail	1
that	1
is	1
fastened	1
in	1
the	1
sure	1
place	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
and	1
fall;	1
and	1
the	1
burden	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
23:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Tyre.	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
laid	1
waste,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
house,	1
no	1
entering	1
in:	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chittim	1
it	1
is	1
revealed	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
23:2	1
Be	1
still,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
isle;	1
thou	1
whom	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
that	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
have	1
replenished.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
by	1
great	1
waters	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Sihor,	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
is	1
her	1
revenue;	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
mart	1
of	1
nations.	1
	1
23:4	1
Be	1
thou	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
Zidon:	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
even	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
I	1
travail	1
not,	1
nor	1
bring	1
forth	1
children,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
nourish	1
up	1
young	1
men,	1
nor	1
bring	1
up	1
virgins.	1
	1
23:5	1
As	1
at	1
the	1
report	1
concerning	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
sorely	1
pained	1
at	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
Tyre.	1
	1
23:6	1
Pass	1
ye	1
over	1
to	1
Tarshish;	1
howl,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
isle.	1
	1
23:7	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
joyous	1
city,	1
whose	1
antiquity	1
is	1
of	1
ancient	1
days?	1
her	1
own	1
feet	1
shall	1
carry	1
her	1
afar	1
off	1
to	1
sojourn.	1
	1
23:8	1
Who	1
hath	1
taken	1
this	1
counsel	1
against	1
Tyre,	1
the	1
crowning	1
city,	1
whose	1
merchants	1
are	1
princes,	1
whose	1
traffickers	1
are	1
the	1
honourable	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
23:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
purposed	1
it,	1
to	1
stain	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
all	1
glory,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
into	1
contempt	1
all	1
the	1
honourable	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:10	1
Pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land	1
as	1
a	1
river,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Tarshish:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
strength.	1
	1
23:11	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
he	1
shook	1
the	1
kingdoms:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
against	1
the	1
merchant	1
city,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
strong	1
holds	1
thereof.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
rejoice,	1
O	1
thou	1
oppressed	1
virgin,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zidon:	1
arise,	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
Chittim;	1
there	1
also	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
23:13	1
Behold	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
this	1
people	1
was	1
not,	1
till	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
founded	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
they	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
towers	1
thereof,	1
they	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
ruin.	1
	1
23:14	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish:	1
for	1
your	1
strength	1
is	1
laid	1
waste.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
Tyre	1
shall	1
be	1
forgotten	1
seventy	1
years,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
one	1
king:	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seventy	1
years	1
shall	1
Tyre	1
sing	1
as	1
an	1
harlot.	1
	1
23:16	1
Take	1
an	1
harp,	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
city,	1
thou	1
harlot	1
that	1
hast	1
been	1
forgotten;	1
make	1
sweet	1
melody,	1
sing	1
many	1
songs,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
remembered.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seventy	1
years,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
visit	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
her	1
hire,	1
and	1
shall	1
commit	1
fornication	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
her	1
merchandise	1
and	1
her	1
hire	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
treasured	1
nor	1
laid	1
up;	1
for	1
her	1
merchandise	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
eat	1
sufficiently,	1
and	1
for	1
durable	1
clothing.	1
	1
24:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
maketh	1
the	1
earth	1
empty,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
waste,	1
and	1
turneth	1
it	1
upside	1
down,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
abroad	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
priest;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
servant,	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
master;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
maid,	1
so	1
with	1
her	1
mistress;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
buyer,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
seller;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
lender,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
borrower;	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
taker	1
of	1
usury,	1
so	1
with	1
the	1
giver	1
of	1
usury	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
24:3	1
The	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
emptied,	1
and	1
utterly	1
spoiled:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
this	1
word.	1
	1
24:4	1
The	1
earth	1
mourneth	1
and	1
fadeth	1
away,	1
the	1
world	1
languisheth	1
and	1
fadeth	1
away,	1
the	1
haughty	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
languish.	1
	1
24:5	1
The	1
earth	1
also	1
is	1
defiled	1
under	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
laws,	1
changed	1
the	1
ordinance,	1
broken	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
24:6	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
curse	1
devoured	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
are	1
desolate:	1
therefore	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
burned,	1
and	1
few	1
men	1
left.	1
	1
24:7	1
The	1
new	1
wine	1
mourneth,	1
the	1
vine	1
languisheth,	1
all	1
the	1
merryhearted	1
do	1
sigh.	1
	1
24:8	1
The	1
mirth	1
of	1
tabrets	1
ceaseth,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
endeth,	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
harp	1
ceaseth.	1
	1
24:9	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
with	1
a	1
song;	1
strong	1
drink	1
shall	1
be	1
bitter	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
drink	1
it.	1
	1
24:10	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
confusion	1
is	1
broken	1
down:	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
shut	1
up,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
24:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
crying	1
for	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
all	1
joy	1
is	1
darkened,	1
the	1
mirth	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
gone.	1
	1
24:12	1
In	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
left	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
gate	1
is	1
smitten	1
with	1
destruction.	1
	1
24:13	1
When	1
thus	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
an	1
olive	1
tree,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
gleaning	1
grapes	1
when	1
the	1
vintage	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
24:14	1
They	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
they	1
shall	1
sing	1
for	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
aloud	1
from	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
24:15	1
Wherefore	1
glorify	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
fires,	1
even	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
24:16	1
From	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
we	1
heard	1
songs,	1
even	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
righteous.	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
My	1
leanness,	1
my	1
leanness,	1
woe	1
unto	1
me!	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealers	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously;	1
yea,	1
the	1
treacherous	1
dealers	1
have	1
dealt	1
very	1
treacherously.	1
	1
24:17	1
Fear,	1
and	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
snare,	1
are	1
upon	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
fleeth	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
pit;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
snare:	1
for	1
the	1
windows	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
are	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
shake.	1
	1
24:19	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
utterly	1
broken	1
down,	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
clean	1
dissolved,	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
moved	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
24:20	1
The	1
earth	1
shall	1
reel	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
removed	1
like	1
a	1
cottage;	1
and	1
the	1
transgression	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
heavy	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
punish	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
ones	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
as	1
prisoners	1
are	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
after	1
many	1
days	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
visited.	1
	1
24:23	1
Then	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
ancients	1
gloriously.	1
	1
25:1	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
God;	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
praise	1
thy	1
name;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
wonderful	1
things;	1
thy	1
counsels	1
of	1
old	1
are	1
faithfulness	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
25:2	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
an	1
heap;	1
of	1
a	1
defenced	1
city	1
a	1
ruin:	1
a	1
palace	1
of	1
strangers	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
city;	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
25:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
strong	1
people	1
glorify	1
thee,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
nations	1
shall	1
fear	1
thee.	1
	1
25:4	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
a	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
a	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
needy	1
in	1
his	1
distress,	1
a	1
refuge	1
from	1
the	1
storm,	1
a	1
shadow	1
from	1
the	1
heat,	1
when	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
storm	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
strangers,	1
as	1
the	1
heat	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
place;	1
even	1
the	1
heat	1
with	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
cloud:	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
make	1
unto	1
all	1
people	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
fat	1
things,	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
wines	1
on	1
the	1
lees,	1
of	1
fat	1
things	1
full	1
of	1
marrow,	1
of	1
wines	1
on	1
the	1
lees	1
well	1
refined.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
destroy	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
covering	1
cast	1
over	1
all	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
is	1
spread	1
over	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
25:8	1
He	1
will	1
swallow	1
up	1
death	1
in	1
victory;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
wipe	1
away	1
tears	1
from	1
off	1
all	1
faces;	1
and	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Lo,	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
God;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
LORD;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
25:10	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
mountain	1
shall	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
rest,	1
and	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
under	1
him,	1
even	1
as	1
straw	1
is	1
trodden	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
dunghill.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
swimmeth	1
spreadeth	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
swim:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
their	1
pride	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
fort	1
of	1
thy	1
walls	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
down,	1
lay	1
low,	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
26:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
this	1
song	1
be	1
sung	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah;	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
city;	1
salvation	1
will	1
God	1
appoint	1
for	1
walls	1
and	1
bulwarks.	1
	1
26:2	1
Open	1
ye	1
the	1
gates,	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
nation	1
which	1
keepeth	1
the	1
truth	1
may	1
enter	1
in.	1
	1
26:3	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
him	1
in	1
perfect	1
peace,	1
whose	1
mind	1
is	1
stayed	1
on	1
thee:	1
because	1
he	1
trusteth	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
26:4	1
Trust	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
JEHOVAH	1
is	1
everlasting	1
strength:	1
26:5	1
For	1
he	1
bringeth	1
down	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
high;	1
the	1
lofty	1
city,	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
low;	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
low,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
he	1
bringeth	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
26:6	1
The	1
foot	1
shall	1
tread	1
it	1
down,	1
even	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
needy.	1
	1
26:7	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
is	1
uprightness:	1
thou,	1
most	1
upright,	1
dost	1
weigh	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
26:8	1
Yea,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
have	1
we	1
waited	1
for	1
thee;	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
our	1
soul	1
is	1
to	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
26:9	1
With	1
my	1
soul	1
have	1
I	1
desired	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
yea,	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
within	1
me	1
will	1
I	1
seek	1
thee	1
early:	1
for	1
when	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
learn	1
righteousness.	1
	1
26:10	1
Let	1
favour	1
be	1
shewed	1
to	1
the	1
wicked,	1
yet	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
learn	1
righteousness:	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
uprightness	1
will	1
he	1
deal	1
unjustly,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
behold	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:11	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thy	1
hand	1
is	1
lifted	1
up,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
see:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
their	1
envy	1
at	1
the	1
people;	1
yea,	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
26:12	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ordain	1
peace	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
thou	1
also	1
hast	1
wrought	1
all	1
our	1
works	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
26:13	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
other	1
lords	1
beside	1
thee	1
have	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
us:	1
but	1
by	1
thee	1
only	1
will	1
we	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
26:14	1
They	1
are	1
dead,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
live;	1
they	1
are	1
deceased,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
rise:	1
therefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
visited	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
their	1
memory	1
to	1
perish.	1
	1
26:15	1
Thou	1
hast	1
increased	1
the	1
nation,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
increased	1
the	1
nation:	1
thou	1
art	1
glorified:	1
thou	1
hadst	1
removed	1
it	1
far	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
26:16	1
LORD,	1
in	1
trouble	1
have	1
they	1
visited	1
thee,	1
they	1
poured	1
out	1
a	1
prayer	1
when	1
thy	1
chastening	1
was	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
26:17	1
Like	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child,	1
that	1
draweth	1
near	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
delivery,	1
is	1
in	1
pain,	1
and	1
crieth	1
out	1
in	1
her	1
pangs;	1
so	1
have	1
we	1
been	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:18	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
child,	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
pain,	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
brought	1
forth	1
wind;	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
wrought	1
any	1
deliverance	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
neither	1
have	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
fallen.	1
	1
26:19	1
Thy	1
dead	1
men	1
shall	1
live,	1
together	1
with	1
my	1
dead	1
body	1
shall	1
they	1
arise.	1
Awake	1
and	1
sing,	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
dust:	1
for	1
thy	1
dew	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
herbs,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
26:20	1
Come,	1
my	1
people,	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
thy	1
chambers,	1
and	1
shut	1
thy	1
doors	1
about	1
thee:	1
hide	1
thyself	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
moment,	1
until	1
the	1
indignation	1
be	1
overpast.	1
	1
26:21	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
shall	1
disclose	1
her	1
blood,	1
and	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
cover	1
her	1
slain.	1
	1
27:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
his	1
sore	1
and	1
great	1
and	1
strong	1
sword	1
shall	1
punish	1
leviathan	1
the	1
piercing	1
serpent,	1
even	1
leviathan	1
that	1
crooked	1
serpent;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
dragon	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:2	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
sing	1
ye	1
unto	1
her,	1
A	1
vineyard	1
of	1
red	1
wine.	1
	1
27:3	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
keep	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
water	1
it	1
every	1
moment:	1
lest	1
any	1
hurt	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
it	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
27:4	1
Fury	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me:	1
who	1
would	1
set	1
the	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns	1
against	1
me	1
in	1
battle?	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
them,	1
I	1
would	1
burn	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
27:5	1
Or	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
strength,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
peace	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
27:6	1
He	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
of	1
Jacob	1
to	1
take	1
root:	1
Israel	1
shall	1
blossom	1
and	1
bud,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
fruit.	1
	1
27:7	1
Hath	1
he	1
smitten	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
smote	1
those	1
that	1
smote	1
him?	1
or	1
is	1
he	1
slain	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
by	1
him?	1
	1
27:8	1
In	1
measure,	1
when	1
it	1
shooteth	1
forth,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
debate	1
with	1
it:	1
he	1
stayeth	1
his	1
rough	1
wind	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
wind.	1
	1
27:9	1
By	1
this	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Jacob	1
be	1
purged;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
sin;	1
when	1
he	1
maketh	1
all	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
as	1
chalkstones	1
that	1
are	1
beaten	1
in	1
sunder,	1
the	1
groves	1
and	1
images	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
27:10	1
Yet	1
the	1
defenced	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
habitation	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
left	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness:	1
there	1
shall	1
the	1
calf	1
feed,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
he	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
consume	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof.	1
	1
27:11	1
When	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof	1
are	1
withered,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
off:	1
the	1
women	1
come,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
on	1
fire:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
no	1
understanding:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
them	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
them	1
will	1
shew	1
them	1
no	1
favour.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
beat	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
unto	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
be	1
blown,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
which	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
perish	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
outcasts	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
shall	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
28:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
pride,	1
to	1
the	1
drunkards	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
whose	1
glorious	1
beauty	1
is	1
a	1
fading	1
flower,	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
valleys	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
overcome	1
with	1
wine!	1
	1
28:2	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
a	1
mighty	1
and	1
strong	1
one,	1
which	1
as	1
a	1
tempest	1
of	1
hail	1
and	1
a	1
destroying	1
storm,	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
mighty	1
waters	1
overflowing,	1
shall	1
cast	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
28:3	1
The	1
crown	1
of	1
pride,	1
the	1
drunkards	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
feet:	1
28:4	1
And	1
the	1
glorious	1
beauty,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
valley,	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fading	1
flower,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
hasty	1
fruit	1
before	1
the	1
summer;	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
looketh	1
upon	1
it	1
seeth,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
eateth	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
28:5	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
diadem	1
of	1
beauty,	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
28:6	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
for	1
strength	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
turn	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
28:7	1
But	1
they	1
also	1
have	1
erred	1
through	1
wine,	1
and	1
through	1
strong	1
drink	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
have	1
erred	1
through	1
strong	1
drink,	1
they	1
are	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
wine,	1
they	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
strong	1
drink;	1
they	1
err	1
in	1
vision,	1
they	1
stumble	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
28:8	1
For	1
all	1
tables	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
vomit	1
and	1
filthiness,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
clean.	1
	1
28:9	1
Whom	1
shall	1
he	1
teach	1
knowledge?	1
and	1
whom	1
shall	1
he	1
make	1
to	1
understand	1
doctrine?	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weaned	1
from	1
the	1
milk,	1
and	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
breasts.	1
	1
28:10	1
For	1
precept	1
must	1
be	1
upon	1
precept,	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept;	1
line	1
upon	1
line,	1
line	1
upon	1
line;	1
here	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
little:	1
28:11	1
For	1
with	1
stammering	1
lips	1
and	1
another	1
tongue	1
will	1
he	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
28:12	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
rest	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
may	1
cause	1
the	1
weary	1
to	1
rest;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
refreshing:	1
yet	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
28:13	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
unto	1
them	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept,	1
precept	1
upon	1
precept;	1
line	1
upon	1
line,	1
line	1
upon	1
line;	1
here	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
little;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
go,	1
and	1
fall	1
backward,	1
and	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
snared,	1
and	1
taken.	1
	1
28:14	1
Wherefore	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
scornful	1
men,	1
that	1
rule	1
this	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
28:15	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
hell	1
are	1
we	1
at	1
agreement;	1
when	1
the	1
overflowing	1
scourge	1
shall	1
pass	1
through,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
lies	1
our	1
refuge,	1
and	1
under	1
falsehood	1
have	1
we	1
hid	1
ourselves:	1
28:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Zion	1
for	1
a	1
foundation	1
a	1
stone,	1
a	1
tried	1
stone,	1
a	1
precious	1
corner	1
stone,	1
a	1
sure	1
foundation:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
haste.	1
	1
28:17	1
Judgment	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
to	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
to	1
the	1
plummet:	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
shall	1
sweep	1
away	1
the	1
refuge	1
of	1
lies,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
overflow	1
the	1
hiding	1
place.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
your	1
covenant	1
with	1
death	1
shall	1
be	1
disannulled,	1
and	1
your	1
agreement	1
with	1
hell	1
shall	1
not	1
stand;	1
when	1
the	1
overflowing	1
scourge	1
shall	1
pass	1
through,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
28:19	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
goeth	1
forth	1
it	1
shall	1
take	1
you:	1
for	1
morning	1
by	1
morning	1
shall	1
it	1
pass	1
over,	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
by	1
night:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vexation	1
only	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
report.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
the	1
bed	1
is	1
shorter	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
covering	1
narrower	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
wrap	1
himself	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
28:21	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
as	1
in	1
mount	1
Perazim,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
wroth	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
his	1
work,	1
his	1
strange	1
work;	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
pass	1
his	1
act,	1
his	1
strange	1
act.	1
	1
28:22	1
Now	1
therefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
mockers,	1
lest	1
your	1
bands	1
be	1
made	1
strong:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
a	1
consumption,	1
even	1
determined	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
28:23	1
Give	1
ye	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
hearken,	1
and	1
hear	1
my	1
speech.	1
	1
28:24	1
Doth	1
the	1
plowman	1
plow	1
all	1
day	1
to	1
sow?	1
doth	1
he	1
open	1
and	1
break	1
the	1
clods	1
of	1
his	1
ground?	1
	1
28:25	1
When	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
plain	1
the	1
face	1
thereof,	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
cast	1
abroad	1
the	1
fitches,	1
and	1
scatter	1
the	1
cummin,	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
wheat	1
and	1
the	1
appointed	1
barley	1
and	1
the	1
rie	1
in	1
their	1
place?	1
	1
28:26	1
For	1
his	1
God	1
doth	1
instruct	1
him	1
to	1
discretion,	1
and	1
doth	1
teach	1
him.	1
	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
fitches	1
are	1
not	1
threshed	1
with	1
a	1
threshing	1
instrument,	1
neither	1
is	1
a	1
cart	1
wheel	1
turned	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
cummin;	1
but	1
the	1
fitches	1
are	1
beaten	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
staff,	1
and	1
the	1
cummin	1
with	1
a	1
rod.	1
	1
28:28	1
Bread	1
corn	1
is	1
bruised;	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
ever	1
be	1
threshing	1
it,	1
nor	1
break	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
his	1
cart,	1
nor	1
bruise	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
28:29	1
This	1
also	1
cometh	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
is	1
wonderful	1
in	1
counsel,	1
and	1
excellent	1
in	1
working.	1
	1
29:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
Ariel,	1
to	1
Ariel,	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
David	1
dwelt!	1
add	1
ye	1
year	1
to	1
year;	1
let	1
them	1
kill	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
29:2	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
distress	1
Ariel,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
heaviness	1
and	1
sorrow:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
Ariel.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
camp	1
against	1
thee	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
lay	1
siege	1
against	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
forts	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
shalt	1
speak	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
shall	1
be	1
low	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
thy	1
voice	1
shall	1
be,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
shall	1
whisper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
29:5	1
Moreover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
strangers	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
small	1
dust,	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
ones	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
chaff	1
that	1
passeth	1
away:	1
yea,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
instant	1
suddenly.	1
	1
29:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
visited	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
with	1
thunder,	1
and	1
with	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
noise,	1
with	1
storm	1
and	1
tempest,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
devouring	1
fire.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
Ariel,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
munition,	1
and	1
that	1
distress	1
her,	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
dream	1
of	1
a	1
night	1
vision.	1
	1
29:8	1
It	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
as	1
when	1
an	1
hungry	1
man	1
dreameth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
eateth;	1
but	1
he	1
awaketh,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
empty:	1
or	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
thirsty	1
man	1
dreameth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
drinketh;	1
but	1
he	1
awaketh,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
faint,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
hath	1
appetite:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
be,	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
mount	1
Zion.	1
	1
29:9	1
Stay	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
wonder;	1
cry	1
ye	1
out,	1
and	1
cry:	1
they	1
are	1
drunken,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
wine;	1
they	1
stagger,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
strong	1
drink.	1
	1
29:10	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
deep	1
sleep,	1
and	1
hath	1
closed	1
your	1
eyes:	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
your	1
rulers,	1
the	1
seers	1
hath	1
he	1
covered.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
become	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
is	1
sealed,	1
which	1
men	1
deliver	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
learned,	1
saying,	1
Read	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
cannot;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
sealed:	1
29:12	1
And	1
the	1
book	1
is	1
delivered	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
learned,	1
saying,	1
Read	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
learned.	1
	1
29:13	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
people	1
draw	1
near	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
lips	1
do	1
honour	1
me,	1
but	1
have	1
removed	1
their	1
heart	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
their	1
fear	1
toward	1
me	1
is	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
precept	1
of	1
men:	1
29:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
marvellous	1
work	1
among	1
this	1
people,	1
even	1
a	1
marvellous	1
work	1
and	1
a	1
wonder:	1
for	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
their	1
wise	1
men	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
their	1
prudent	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
29:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
deep	1
to	1
hide	1
their	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
Who	1
seeth	1
us?	1
and	1
who	1
knoweth	1
us?	1
	1
29:16	1
Surely	1
your	1
turning	1
of	1
things	1
upside	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
the	1
potter's	1
clay:	1
for	1
shall	1
the	1
work	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
it,	1
He	1
made	1
me	1
not?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
thing	1
framed	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
framed	1
it,	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
understanding?	1
	1
29:17	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
yet	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
esteemed	1
as	1
a	1
forest?	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
shall	1
see	1
out	1
of	1
obscurity,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
29:19	1
The	1
meek	1
also	1
shall	1
increase	1
their	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
among	1
men	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:20	1
For	1
the	1
terrible	1
one	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
nought,	1
and	1
the	1
scorner	1
is	1
consumed,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
watch	1
for	1
iniquity	1
are	1
cut	1
off:	1
29:21	1
That	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
an	1
offender	1
for	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
lay	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
reproveth	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought.	1
	1
29:22	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
redeemed	1
Abraham,	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
his	1
face	1
now	1
wax	1
pale.	1
	1
29:23	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
his	1
children,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
mine	1
hands,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:24	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
erred	1
in	1
spirit	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
understanding,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
murmured	1
shall	1
learn	1
doctrine.	1
	1
30:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
rebellious	1
children,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
take	1
counsel,	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
that	1
cover	1
with	1
a	1
covering,	1
but	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
add	1
sin	1
to	1
sin:	1
30:2	1
That	1
walk	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
asked	1
at	1
my	1
mouth;	1
to	1
strengthen	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Egypt!	1
	1
30:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
be	1
your	1
shame,	1
and	1
the	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Egypt	1
your	1
confusion.	1
	1
30:4	1
For	1
his	1
princes	1
were	1
at	1
Zoan,	1
and	1
his	1
ambassadors	1
came	1
to	1
Hanes.	1
	1
30:5	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
ashamed	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
nor	1
be	1
an	1
help	1
nor	1
profit,	1
but	1
a	1
shame,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
reproach.	1
	1
30:6	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
anguish,	1
from	1
whence	1
come	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
old	1
lion,	1
the	1
viper	1
and	1
fiery	1
flying	1
serpent,	1
they	1
will	1
carry	1
their	1
riches	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
young	1
asses,	1
and	1
their	1
treasures	1
upon	1
the	1
bunches	1
of	1
camels,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
them.	1
	1
30:7	1
For	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
help	1
in	1
vain,	1
and	1
to	1
no	1
purpose:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
cried	1
concerning	1
this,	1
Their	1
strength	1
is	1
to	1
sit	1
still.	1
	1
30:8	1
Now	1
go,	1
write	1
it	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
note	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
30:9	1
That	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
rebellious	1
people,	1
lying	1
children,	1
children	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
30:10	1
Which	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
seers,	1
See	1
not;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
unto	1
us	1
right	1
things,	1
speak	1
unto	1
us	1
smooth	1
things,	1
prophesy	1
deceits:	1
30:11	1
Get	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
turn	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
path,	1
cause	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
before	1
us.	1
	1
30:12	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Because	1
ye	1
despise	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
oppression	1
and	1
perverseness,	1
and	1
stay	1
thereon:	1
30:13	1
Therefore	1
this	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
breach	1
ready	1
to	1
fall,	1
swelling	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
wall,	1
whose	1
breaking	1
cometh	1
suddenly	1
at	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
potters'	1
vessel	1
that	1
is	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
spare:	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
bursting	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
sherd	1
to	1
take	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
hearth,	1
or	1
to	1
take	1
water	1
withal	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
30:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
In	1
returning	1
and	1
rest	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
saved;	1
in	1
quietness	1
and	1
in	1
confidence	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
strength:	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not.	1
	1
30:16	1
But	1
ye	1
said,	1
No;	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
flee	1
upon	1
horses;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
flee:	1
and,	1
We	1
will	1
ride	1
upon	1
the	1
swift;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
pursue	1
you	1
be	1
swift.	1
	1
30:17	1
One	1
thousand	1
shall	1
flee	1
at	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
one;	1
at	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
five	1
shall	1
ye	1
flee:	1
till	1
ye	1
be	1
left	1
as	1
a	1
beacon	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
ensign	1
on	1
an	1
hill.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
therefore	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
wait,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
therefore	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
exalted,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
judgment:	1
blessed	1
are	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
30:19	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Zion	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
weep	1
no	1
more:	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
gracious	1
unto	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
cry;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
it,	1
he	1
will	1
answer	1
thee.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
adversity,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
affliction,	1
yet	1
shall	1
not	1
thy	1
teachers	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
teachers:	1
30:21	1
And	1
thine	1
ears	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
behind	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
it,	1
when	1
ye	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
30:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
defile	1
also	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
thy	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
thy	1
molten	1
images	1
of	1
gold:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cast	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
a	1
menstruous	1
cloth;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
it,	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence.	1
	1
30:23	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
give	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
the	1
ground	1
withal;	1
and	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
fat	1
and	1
plenteous:	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
thy	1
cattle	1
feed	1
in	1
large	1
pastures.	1
	1
30:24	1
The	1
oxen	1
likewise	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
asses	1
that	1
ear	1
the	1
ground	1
shall	1
eat	1
clean	1
provender,	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
winnowed	1
with	1
the	1
shovel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fan.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
rivers	1
and	1
streams	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
slaughter,	1
when	1
the	1
towers	1
fall.	1
	1
30:26	1
Moreover	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
sevenfold,	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
seven	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
bindeth	1
up	1
the	1
breach	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
healeth	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
their	1
wound.	1
	1
30:27	1
Behold,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
from	1
far,	1
burning	1
with	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
burden	1
thereof	1
is	1
heavy:	1
his	1
lips	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
indignation,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
as	1
a	1
devouring	1
fire:	1
30:28	1
And	1
his	1
breath,	1
as	1
an	1
overflowing	1
stream,	1
shall	1
reach	1
to	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
neck,	1
to	1
sift	1
the	1
nations	1
with	1
the	1
sieve	1
of	1
vanity:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
bridle	1
in	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
causing	1
them	1
to	1
err.	1
	1
30:29	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
song,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
when	1
a	1
holy	1
solemnity	1
is	1
kept;	1
and	1
gladness	1
of	1
heart,	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
goeth	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
30:30	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
cause	1
his	1
glorious	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
the	1
lighting	1
down	1
of	1
his	1
arm,	1
with	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
a	1
devouring	1
fire,	1
with	1
scattering,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
and	1
hailstones.	1
	1
30:31	1
For	1
through	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
be	1
beaten	1
down,	1
which	1
smote	1
with	1
a	1
rod.	1
	1
30:32	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
grounded	1
staff	1
shall	1
pass,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lay	1
upon	1
him,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
tabrets	1
and	1
harps:	1
and	1
in	1
battles	1
of	1
shaking	1
will	1
he	1
fight	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
30:33	1
For	1
Tophet	1
is	1
ordained	1
of	1
old;	1
yea,	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
it	1
is	1
prepared;	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
deep	1
and	1
large:	1
the	1
pile	1
thereof	1
is	1
fire	1
and	1
much	1
wood;	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
brimstone,	1
doth	1
kindle	1
it.	1
	1
31:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt	1
for	1
help;	1
and	1
stay	1
on	1
horses,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
chariots,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
many;	1
and	1
in	1
horsemen,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
strong;	1
but	1
they	1
look	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD!	1
	1
31:2	1
Yet	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
evil,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
back	1
his	1
words:	1
but	1
will	1
arise	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity.	1
	1
31:3	1
Now	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
are	1
men,	1
and	1
not	1
God;	1
and	1
their	1
horses	1
flesh,	1
and	1
not	1
spirit.	1
When	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
helpeth	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holpen	1
shall	1
fall	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
fail	1
together.	1
	1
31:4	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
Like	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lion	1
roaring	1
on	1
his	1
prey,	1
when	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
shepherds	1
is	1
called	1
forth	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
voice,	1
nor	1
abase	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them:	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
fight	1
for	1
mount	1
Zion,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
hill	1
thereof.	1
	1
31:5	1
As	1
birds	1
flying,	1
so	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
defend	1
Jerusalem;	1
defending	1
also	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
it;	1
and	1
passing	1
over	1
he	1
will	1
preserve	1
it.	1
	1
31:6	1
Turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
deeply	1
revolted.	1
	1
31:7	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
his	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
your	1
own	1
hands	1
have	1
made	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
sin.	1
	1
31:8	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
fall	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
sword,	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
mean	1
man,	1
shall	1
devour	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
his	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
discomfited.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
strong	1
hold	1
for	1
fear,	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
ensign,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
fire	1
is	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
his	1
furnace	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
32:1	1
Behold,	1
a	1
king	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
princes	1
shall	1
rule	1
in	1
judgment.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
an	1
hiding	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
a	1
covert	1
from	1
the	1
tempest;	1
as	1
rivers	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
place,	1
as	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
rock	1
in	1
a	1
weary	1
land.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
see	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
dim,	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
hearken.	1
	1
32:4	1
The	1
heart	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
rash	1
shall	1
understand	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
stammerers	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
speak	1
plainly.	1
	1
32:5	1
The	1
vile	1
person	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
called	1
liberal,	1
nor	1
the	1
churl	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
bountiful.	1
	1
32:6	1
For	1
the	1
vile	1
person	1
will	1
speak	1
villany,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
will	1
work	1
iniquity,	1
to	1
practise	1
hypocrisy,	1
and	1
to	1
utter	1
error	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
empty	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
thirsty	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
32:7	1
The	1
instruments	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
churl	1
are	1
evil:	1
he	1
deviseth	1
wicked	1
devices	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
poor	1
with	1
lying	1
words,	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
needy	1
speaketh	1
right.	1
	1
32:8	1
But	1
the	1
liberal	1
deviseth	1
liberal	1
things;	1
and	1
by	1
liberal	1
things	1
shall	1
he	1
stand.	1
	1
32:9	1
Rise	1
up,	1
ye	1
women	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease;	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
ye	1
careless	1
daughters;	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
my	1
speech.	1
	1
32:10	1
Many	1
days	1
and	1
years	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
troubled,	1
ye	1
careless	1
women:	1
for	1
the	1
vintage	1
shall	1
fail,	1
the	1
gathering	1
shall	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
32:11	1
Tremble,	1
ye	1
women	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease;	1
be	1
troubled,	1
ye	1
careless	1
ones:	1
strip	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
bare,	1
and	1
gird	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
your	1
loins.	1
	1
32:12	1
They	1
shall	1
lament	1
for	1
the	1
teats,	1
for	1
the	1
pleasant	1
fields,	1
for	1
the	1
fruitful	1
vine.	1
	1
32:13	1
Upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers;	1
yea,	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
joyous	1
city:	1
32:14	1
Because	1
the	1
palaces	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken;	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
left;	1
the	1
forts	1
and	1
towers	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
dens	1
for	1
ever,	1
a	1
joy	1
of	1
wild	1
asses,	1
a	1
pasture	1
of	1
flocks;	1
32:15	1
Until	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
poured	1
upon	1
us	1
from	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
wilderness	1
be	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
a	1
forest.	1
	1
32:16	1
Then	1
judgment	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
fruitful	1
field.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
righteousness	1
quietness	1
and	1
assurance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:18	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
peaceable	1
habitation,	1
and	1
in	1
sure	1
dwellings,	1
and	1
in	1
quiet	1
resting	1
places;	1
32:19	1
When	1
it	1
shall	1
hail,	1
coming	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
forest;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
low	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
place.	1
	1
32:20	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
sow	1
beside	1
all	1
waters,	1
that	1
send	1
forth	1
thither	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
and	1
the	1
ass.	1
	1
33:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
thee	1
that	1
spoilest,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
dealest	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
they	1
dealt	1
not	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee!	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cease	1
to	1
spoil,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
spoiled;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
deal	1
treacherously,	1
they	1
shall	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
33:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
thee:	1
be	1
thou	1
their	1
arm	1
every	1
morning,	1
our	1
salvation	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
trouble.	1
	1
33:3	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
tumult	1
the	1
people	1
fled;	1
at	1
the	1
lifting	1
up	1
of	1
thyself	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
scattered.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
your	1
spoil	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
like	1
the	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
caterpiller:	1
as	1
the	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
of	1
locusts	1
shall	1
he	1
run	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
33:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
exalted;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
on	1
high:	1
he	1
hath	1
filled	1
Zion	1
with	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness.	1
	1
33:6	1
And	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
thy	1
times,	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
salvation:	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
treasure.	1
	1
33:7	1
Behold,	1
their	1
valiant	1
ones	1
shall	1
cry	1
without:	1
the	1
ambassadors	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
weep	1
bitterly.	1
	1
33:8	1
The	1
highways	1
lie	1
waste,	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
ceaseth:	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
the	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
cities,	1
he	1
regardeth	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
33:9	1
The	1
earth	1
mourneth	1
and	1
languisheth:	1
Lebanon	1
is	1
ashamed	1
and	1
hewn	1
down:	1
Sharon	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
Bashan	1
and	1
Carmel	1
shake	1
off	1
their	1
fruits.	1
	1
33:10	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
rise,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
exalted;	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
lift	1
up	1
myself.	1
	1
33:11	1
Ye	1
shall	1
conceive	1
chaff,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
stubble:	1
your	1
breath,	1
as	1
fire,	1
shall	1
devour	1
you.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
burnings	1
of	1
lime:	1
as	1
thorns	1
cut	1
up	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
33:13	1
Hear,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done;	1
and,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
near,	1
acknowledge	1
my	1
might.	1
	1
33:14	1
The	1
sinners	1
in	1
Zion	1
are	1
afraid;	1
fearfulness	1
hath	1
surprised	1
the	1
hypocrites.	1
Who	1
among	1
us	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
devouring	1
fire?	1
who	1
among	1
us	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
everlasting	1
burnings?	1
	1
33:15	1
He	1
that	1
walketh	1
righteously,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
uprightly;	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
the	1
gain	1
of	1
oppressions,	1
that	1
shaketh	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
holding	1
of	1
bribes,	1
that	1
stoppeth	1
his	1
ears	1
from	1
hearing	1
of	1
blood,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
seeing	1
evil;	1
33:16	1
He	1
shall	1
dwell	1
on	1
high:	1
his	1
place	1
of	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
munitions	1
of	1
rocks:	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him;	1
his	1
waters	1
shall	1
be	1
sure.	1
	1
33:17	1
Thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
beauty:	1
they	1
shall	1
behold	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
33:18	1
Thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
meditate	1
terror.	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
receiver?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
counted	1
the	1
towers?	1
	1
33:19	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
fierce	1
people,	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
deeper	1
speech	1
than	1
thou	1
canst	1
perceive;	1
of	1
a	1
stammering	1
tongue,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
33:20	1
Look	1
upon	1
Zion,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
our	1
solemnities:	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
quiet	1
habitation,	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
down;	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stakes	1
thereof	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
removed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cords	1
thereof	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
33:21	1
But	1
there	1
the	1
glorious	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
broad	1
rivers	1
and	1
streams;	1
wherein	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1
galley	1
with	1
oars,	1
neither	1
shall	1
gallant	1
ship	1
pass	1
thereby.	1
	1
33:22	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
judge,	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
lawgiver,	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
king;	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
33:23	1
Thy	1
tacklings	1
are	1
loosed;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
strengthen	1
their	1
mast,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
spread	1
the	1
sail:	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
spoil	1
divided;	1
the	1
lame	1
take	1
the	1
prey.	1
	1
33:24	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
shall	1
not	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
sick:	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
34:1	1
Come	1
near,	1
ye	1
nations,	1
to	1
hear;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
people:	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
hear,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein;	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
come	1
forth	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
34:2	1
For	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
his	1
fury	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
armies:	1
he	1
hath	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
34:3	1
Their	1
slain	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out,	1
and	1
their	1
stink	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
carcases,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
melted	1
with	1
their	1
blood.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
be	1
rolled	1
together	1
as	1
a	1
scroll:	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
host	1
shall	1
fall	1
down,	1
as	1
the	1
leaf	1
falleth	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
falling	1
fig	1
from	1
the	1
fig	1
tree.	1
	1
34:5	1
For	1
my	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
bathed	1
in	1
heaven:	1
behold,	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
Idumea,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
curse,	1
to	1
judgment.	1
	1
34:6	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
blood,	1
it	1
is	1
made	1
fat	1
with	1
fatness,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
lambs	1
and	1
goats,	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
kidneys	1
of	1
rams:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
Bozrah,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Idumea.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
the	1
unicorns	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
bullocks	1
with	1
the	1
bulls;	1
and	1
their	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
soaked	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
their	1
dust	1
made	1
fat	1
with	1
fatness.	1
	1
34:8	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
recompences	1
for	1
the	1
controversy	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
the	1
streams	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
pitch,	1
and	1
the	1
dust	1
thereof	1
into	1
brimstone,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
thereof	1
shall	1
become	1
burning	1
pitch.	1
	1
34:10	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched	1
night	1
nor	1
day;	1
the	1
smoke	1
thereof	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
for	1
ever:	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
it	1
shall	1
lie	1
waste;	1
none	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
34:11	1
But	1
the	1
cormorant	1
and	1
the	1
bittern	1
shall	1
possess	1
it;	1
the	1
owl	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
raven	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stretch	1
out	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
confusion,	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
emptiness.	1
	1
34:12	1
They	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
nobles	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
but	1
none	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
34:13	1
And	1
thorns	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
palaces,	1
nettles	1
and	1
brambles	1
in	1
the	1
fortresses	1
thereof:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
dragons,	1
and	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
owls.	1
	1
34:14	1
The	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
also	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
and	1
the	1
satyr	1
shall	1
cry	1
to	1
his	1
fellow;	1
the	1
screech	1
owl	1
also	1
shall	1
rest	1
there,	1
and	1
find	1
for	1
herself	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
rest.	1
	1
34:15	1
There	1
shall	1
the	1
great	1
owl	1
make	1
her	1
nest,	1
and	1
lay,	1
and	1
hatch,	1
and	1
gather	1
under	1
her	1
shadow:	1
there	1
shall	1
the	1
vultures	1
also	1
be	1
gathered,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
her	1
mate.	1
	1
34:16	1
Seek	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
read:	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
shall	1
fail,	1
none	1
shall	1
want	1
her	1
mate:	1
for	1
my	1
mouth	1
it	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
and	1
his	1
spirit	1
it	1
hath	1
gathered	1
them.	1
	1
34:17	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
the	1
lot	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
divided	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
line:	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
it	1
for	1
ever,	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
shall	1
they	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
35:1	1
The	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
solitary	1
place	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
for	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
desert	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
blossom	1
as	1
the	1
rose.	1
	1
35:2	1
It	1
shall	1
blossom	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
even	1
with	1
joy	1
and	1
singing:	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
it,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Carmel	1
and	1
Sharon,	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
35:3	1
Strengthen	1
ye	1
the	1
weak	1
hands,	1
and	1
confirm	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees.	1
	1
35:4	1
Say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
fearful	1
heart,	1
Be	1
strong,	1
fear	1
not:	1
behold,	1
your	1
God	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
vengeance,	1
even	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
recompence;	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
save	1
you.	1
	1
35:5	1
Then	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
deaf	1
shall	1
be	1
unstopped.	1
	1
35:6	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
leap	1
as	1
an	1
hart,	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
dumb	1
sing:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
shall	1
waters	1
break	1
out,	1
and	1
streams	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
35:7	1
And	1
the	1
parched	1
ground	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
pool,	1
and	1
the	1
thirsty	1
land	1
springs	1
of	1
water:	1
in	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
dragons,	1
where	1
each	1
lay,	1
shall	1
be	1
grass	1
with	1
reeds	1
and	1
rushes.	1
	1
35:8	1
And	1
an	1
highway	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
and	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
holiness;	1
the	1
unclean	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
those:	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
men,	1
though	1
fools,	1
shall	1
not	1
err	1
therein.	1
	1
35:9	1
No	1
lion	1
shall	1
be	1
there,	1
nor	1
any	1
ravenous	1
beast	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
thereon,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
there;	1
but	1
the	1
redeemed	1
shall	1
walk	1
there:	1
35:10	1
And	1
the	1
ransomed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
Zion	1
with	1
songs	1
and	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
upon	1
their	1
heads:	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
sorrow	1
and	1
sighing	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
36:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
that	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
took	1
them.	1
	1
36:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
sent	1
Rabshakeh	1
from	1
Lachish	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army.	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
conduit	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
pool	1
in	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's	1
field.	1
	1
36:3	1
Then	1
came	1
forth	1
unto	1
him	1
Eliakim,	1
Hilkiah's	1
son,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah,	1
Asaph's	1
son,	1
the	1
recorder.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
Rabshakeh	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Say	1
ye	1
now	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
What	1
confidence	1
is	1
this	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustest?	1
	1
36:5	1
I	1
say,	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
(but	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
vain	1
words)	1
I	1
have	1
counsel	1
and	1
strength	1
for	1
war:	1
now	1
on	1
whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
trust,	1
that	1
thou	1
rebellest	1
against	1
me?	1
	1
36:6	1
Lo,	1
thou	1
trustest	1
in	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
this	1
broken	1
reed,	1
on	1
Egypt;	1
whereon	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lean,	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
pierce	1
it:	1
so	1
is	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
36:7	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
We	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
he,	1
whose	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
whose	1
altars	1
Hezekiah	1
hath	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Judah	1
and	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
worship	1
before	1
this	1
altar?	1
36:8	1
Now	1
therefore	1
give	1
pledges,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
two	1
thousand	1
horses,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
able	1
on	1
thy	1
part	1
to	1
set	1
riders	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
36:9	1
How	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
one	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
my	1
master's	1
servants,	1
and	1
put	1
thy	1
trust	1
on	1
Egypt	1
for	1
chariots	1
and	1
for	1
horsemen?	1
	1
36:10	1
And	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
come	1
up	1
without	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
36:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Eliakim	1
and	1
Shebna	1
and	1
Joah	1
unto	1
Rabshakeh,	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
Syrian	1
language;	1
for	1
we	1
understand	1
it:	1
and	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
36:12	1
But	1
Rabshakeh	1
said,	1
Hath	1
my	1
master	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
thy	1
master	1
and	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
these	1
words?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
dung,	1
and	1
drink	1
their	1
own	1
piss	1
with	1
you?	1
	1
36:13	1
Then	1
Rabshakeh	1
stood,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
36:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
not	1
Hezekiah	1
deceive	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
you.	1
	1
36:15	1
Neither	1
let	1
Hezekiah	1
make	1
you	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
surely	1
deliver	1
us:	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
36:16	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
Make	1
an	1
agreement	1
with	1
me	1
by	1
a	1
present,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
me:	1
and	1
eat	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vine,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
drink	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cistern;	1
36:17	1
Until	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
like	1
your	1
own	1
land,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
vineyards.	1
	1
36:18	1
Beware	1
lest	1
Hezekiah	1
persuade	1
you,	1
saying,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
deliver	1
us.	1
	1
Hath	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
his	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria?	1
	1
36:19	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Hamath	1
and	1
Arphad?	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Sepharvaim?	1
and	1
have	1
they	1
delivered	1
Samaria	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand?	1
	1
36:20	1
Who	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
these	1
lands,	1
that	1
have	1
delivered	1
their	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
should	1
deliver	1
Jerusalem	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand?	1
	1
36:21	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was,	1
saying,	1
Answer	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
36:22	1
Then	1
came	1
Eliakim,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asaph,	1
the	1
recorder,	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh.	1
	1
37:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
covered	1
himself	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Eliakim,	1
who	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
unto	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz.	1
	1
37:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Hezekiah,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
of	1
rebuke,	1
and	1
of	1
blasphemy:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
strength	1
to	1
bring	1
forth.	1
	1
37:4	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
his	1
master	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
heard:	1
wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
is	1
left.	1
	1
37:5	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
came	1
to	1
Isaiah.	1
	1
37:6	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
your	1
master,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
blasphemed	1
me.	1
	1
37:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
blast	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
rumour,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
37:8	1
So	1
Rabshakeh	1
returned,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
warring	1
against	1
Libnah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
Lachish.	1
	1
37:9	1
And	1
he	1
heard	1
say	1
concerning	1
Tirhakah	1
king	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
He	1
is	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
thee.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
37:10	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
God,	1
in	1
whom	1
thou	1
trustest,	1
deceive	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
37:11	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
all	1
lands	1
by	1
destroying	1
them	1
utterly;	1
and	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered?	1
37:12	1
Have	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
them	1
which	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
destroyed,	1
as	1
Gozan,	1
and	1
Haran,	1
and	1
Rezeph,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Eden	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Telassar?	1
	1
37:13	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Arphad,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sepharvaim,	1
Hena,	1
and	1
Ivah?	1
	1
37:14	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
received	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
read	1
it:	1
and	1
Hezekiah	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:15	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
37:16	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
God,	1
even	1
thou	1
alone,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
37:17	1
Incline	1
thine	1
ear,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hear;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see:	1
and	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Sennacherib,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
37:18	1
Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
LORD,	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
laid	1
waste	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
their	1
countries,	1
37:19	1
And	1
have	1
cast	1
their	1
gods	1
into	1
the	1
fire:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
gods,	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone:	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
37:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
thou	1
only.	1
	1
37:21	1
Then	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
sent	1
unto	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
hast	1
prayed	1
to	1
me	1
against	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
37:22	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
him;	1
The	1
virgin,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
hath	1
despised	1
thee,	1
and	1
laughed	1
thee	1
to	1
scorn;	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
hath	1
shaken	1
her	1
head	1
at	1
thee.	1
	1
37:23	1
Whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
reproached	1
and	1
blasphemed?	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
exalted	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
on	1
high?	1
even	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
37:24	1
By	1
thy	1
servants	1
hast	1
thou	1
reproached	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
hast	1
said,	1
By	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
my	1
chariots	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
tall	1
cedars	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
fir	1
trees	1
thereof:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
border,	1
and	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
his	1
Carmel.	1
	1
37:25	1
I	1
have	1
digged,	1
and	1
drunk	1
water;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
my	1
feet	1
have	1
I	1
dried	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
the	1
besieged	1
places.	1
	1
37:26	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard	1
long	1
ago,	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it;	1
and	1
of	1
ancient	1
times,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
it?	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
to	1
lay	1
waste	1
defenced	1
cities	1
into	1
ruinous	1
heaps.	1
	1
37:27	1
Therefore	1
their	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
of	1
small	1
power,	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb,	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
on	1
the	1
housetops,	1
and	1
as	1
corn	1
blasted	1
before	1
it	1
be	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
37:28	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
abode,	1
and	1
thy	1
going	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
37:29	1
Because	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
thy	1
tumult,	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
mine	1
ears,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
hook	1
in	1
thy	1
nose,	1
and	1
my	1
bridle	1
in	1
thy	1
lips,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
thee	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
thou	1
camest.	1
	1
37:30	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
year	1
such	1
as	1
groweth	1
of	1
itself;	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
that	1
which	1
springeth	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
sow	1
ye,	1
and	1
reap,	1
and	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof.	1
	1
37:31	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
is	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
again	1
take	1
root	1
downward,	1
and	1
bear	1
fruit	1
upward:	1
37:32	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
mount	1
Zion:	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
do	1
this.	1
	1
37:33	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
nor	1
shoot	1
an	1
arrow	1
there,	1
nor	1
come	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
shields,	1
nor	1
cast	1
a	1
bank	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
37:34	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
came,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:35	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city	1
to	1
save	1
it	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake.	1
	1
37:36	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
smote	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
thousand:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
dead	1
corpses.	1
	1
37:37	1
So	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Nineveh.	1
	1
37:38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
worshipping	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nisroch	1
his	1
god,	1
that	1
Adrammelech	1
and	1
Sharezer	1
his	1
sons	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Armenia:	1
and	1
Esarhaddon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
38:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
was	1
Hezekiah	1
sick	1
unto	1
death.	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Set	1
thine	1
house	1
in	1
order:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
and	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
38:2	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
38:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Remember	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
wept	1
sore.	1
	1
38:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Isaiah,	1
saying,	1
38:5	1
Go,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayer,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
tears:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
unto	1
thy	1
days	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
38:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
38:7	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken;	1
38:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
degrees,	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
dial	1
of	1
Ahaz,	1
ten	1
degrees	1
backward.	1
So	1
the	1
sun	1
returned	1
ten	1
degrees,	1
by	1
which	1
degrees	1
it	1
was	1
gone	1
down.	1
	1
38:9	1
The	1
writing	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick,	1
and	1
was	1
recovered	1
of	1
his	1
sickness:	1
38:10	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
cutting	1
off	1
of	1
my	1
days,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
grave:	1
I	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
my	1
years.	1
	1
38:11	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
man	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
38:12	1
Mine	1
age	1
is	1
departed,	1
and	1
is	1
removed	1
from	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd's	1
tent:	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
like	1
a	1
weaver	1
my	1
life:	1
he	1
will	1
cut	1
me	1
off	1
with	1
pining	1
sickness:	1
from	1
day	1
even	1
to	1
night	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
38:13	1
I	1
reckoned	1
till	1
morning,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
so	1
will	1
he	1
break	1
all	1
my	1
bones:	1
from	1
day	1
even	1
to	1
night	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
38:14	1
Like	1
a	1
crane	1
or	1
a	1
swallow,	1
so	1
did	1
I	1
chatter:	1
I	1
did	1
mourn	1
as	1
a	1
dove:	1
mine	1
eyes	1
fail	1
with	1
looking	1
upward:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
am	1
oppressed;	1
undertake	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
38:15	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
himself	1
hath	1
done	1
it:	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
softly	1
all	1
my	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
my	1
soul.	1
	1
38:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
by	1
these	1
things	1
men	1
live,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
spirit:	1
so	1
wilt	1
thou	1
recover	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
38:17	1
Behold,	1
for	1
peace	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
bitterness:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
love	1
to	1
my	1
soul	1
delivered	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
cast	1
all	1
my	1
sins	1
behind	1
thy	1
back.	1
	1
38:18	1
For	1
the	1
grave	1
cannot	1
praise	1
thee,	1
death	1
can	1
not	1
celebrate	1
thee:	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
cannot	1
hope	1
for	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
38:19	1
The	1
living,	1
the	1
living,	1
he	1
shall	1
praise	1
thee,	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
day:	1
the	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
38:20	1
The	1
LORD	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
save	1
me:	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
sing	1
my	1
songs	1
to	1
the	1
stringed	1
instruments	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
38:21	1
For	1
Isaiah	1
had	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
take	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
plaister	1
upon	1
the	1
boil,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
recover.	1
	1
38:22	1
Hezekiah	1
also	1
had	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
sign	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
39:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Merodachbaladan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Baladan,	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
sent	1
letters	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick,	1
and	1
was	1
recovered.	1
	1
39:2	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
precious	1
things,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
spices,	1
and	1
the	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
treasures:	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
nor	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
dominion,	1
that	1
Hezekiah	1
shewed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
39:3	1
Then	1
came	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
said	1
these	1
men?	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
they	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
from	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:4	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
seen	1
in	1
thine	1
house?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
answered,	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
have	1
they	1
seen:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
among	1
my	1
treasures	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
39:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Isaiah	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
39:6	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
until	1
this	1
day,	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
that	1
shall	1
issue	1
from	1
thee,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beget,	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
away;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
eunuchs	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Hezekiah	1
to	1
Isaiah,	1
Good	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
peace	1
and	1
truth	1
in	1
my	1
days.	1
	1
40:1	1
Comfort	1
ye,	1
comfort	1
ye	1
my	1
people,	1
saith	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
40:2	1
Speak	1
ye	1
comfortably	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
her,	1
that	1
her	1
warfare	1
is	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
her	1
iniquity	1
is	1
pardoned:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
double	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
sins.	1
	1
40:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
crieth	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
make	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
a	1
highway	1
for	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
40:4	1
Every	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted,	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
hill	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
low:	1
and	1
the	1
crooked	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
places	1
plain:	1
40:5	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
it	1
together:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
40:6	1
The	1
voice	1
said,	1
Cry.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
cry?	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
goodliness	1
thereof	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
40:7	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
the	1
flower	1
fadeth:	1
because	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
bloweth	1
upon	1
it:	1
surely	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
grass.	1
	1
40:8	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
the	1
flower	1
fadeth:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
40:9	1
O	1
Zion,	1
that	1
bringest	1
good	1
tidings,	1
get	1
thee	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
mountain;	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
bringest	1
good	1
tidings,	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
with	1
strength;	1
lift	1
it	1
up,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid;	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Behold	1
your	1
God!	1
	1
40:10	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
rule	1
for	1
him:	1
behold,	1
his	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
work	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
40:11	1
He	1
shall	1
feed	1
his	1
flock	1
like	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
the	1
lambs	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
shall	1
gently	1
lead	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
young.	1
	1
40:12	1
Who	1
hath	1
measured	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
meted	1
out	1
heaven	1
with	1
the	1
span,	1
and	1
comprehended	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
a	1
measure,	1
and	1
weighed	1
the	1
mountains	1
in	1
scales,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
in	1
a	1
balance?	1
	1
40:13	1
Who	1
hath	1
directed	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
or	1
being	1
his	1
counsellor	1
hath	1
taught	1
him?	1
	1
40:14	1
With	1
whom	1
took	1
he	1
counsel,	1
and	1
who	1
instructed	1
him,	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
taught	1
him	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
shewed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
understanding?	1
	1
40:15	1
Behold,	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
a	1
bucket,	1
and	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
the	1
small	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
balance:	1
behold,	1
he	1
taketh	1
up	1
the	1
isles	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
thing.	1
	1
40:16	1
And	1
Lebanon	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
burn,	1
nor	1
the	1
beasts	1
thereof	1
sufficient	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
40:17	1
All	1
nations	1
before	1
him	1
are	1
as	1
nothing;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
counted	1
to	1
him	1
less	1
than	1
nothing,	1
and	1
vanity.	1
	1
40:18	1
To	1
whom	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
God?	1
or	1
what	1
likeness	1
will	1
ye	1
compare	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
40:19	1
The	1
workman	1
melteth	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
the	1
goldsmith	1
spreadeth	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
casteth	1
silver	1
chains.	1
	1
40:20	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
impoverished	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
oblation	1
chooseth	1
a	1
tree	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
rot;	1
he	1
seeketh	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
cunning	1
workman	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
40:21	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
known?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
heard?	1
hath	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
40:22	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
are	1
as	1
grasshoppers;	1
that	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
the	1
heavens	1
as	1
a	1
curtain,	1
and	1
spreadeth	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
tent	1
to	1
dwell	1
in:	1
40:23	1
That	1
bringeth	1
the	1
princes	1
to	1
nothing;	1
he	1
maketh	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
vanity.	1
	1
40:24	1
Yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
planted;	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sown:	1
yea,	1
their	1
stock	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
root	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
blow	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wither,	1
and	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
stubble.	1
	1
40:25	1
To	1
whom	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
me,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
equal?	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
One.	1
	1
40:26	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
behold	1
who	1
hath	1
created	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
bringeth	1
out	1
their	1
host	1
by	1
number:	1
he	1
calleth	1
them	1
all	1
by	1
names	1
by	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
might,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
in	1
power;	1
not	1
one	1
faileth.	1
	1
40:27	1
Why	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
speakest,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
My	1
way	1
is	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
passed	1
over	1
from	1
my	1
God?	1
	1
40:28	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known?	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard,	1
that	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Creator	1
of	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
fainteth	1
not,	1
neither	1
is	1
weary?	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
searching	1
of	1
his	1
understanding.	1
	1
40:29	1
He	1
giveth	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
faint;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
might	1
he	1
increaseth	1
strength.	1
	1
40:30	1
Even	1
the	1
youths	1
shall	1
faint	1
and	1
be	1
weary,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
utterly	1
fall:	1
40:31	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
renew	1
their	1
strength;	1
they	1
shall	1
mount	1
up	1
with	1
wings	1
as	1
eagles;	1
they	1
shall	1
run,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
weary;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk,	1
and	1
not	1
faint.	1
	1
41:1	1
Keep	1
silence	1
before	1
me,	1
O	1
islands;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
renew	1
their	1
strength:	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
near;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
speak:	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
near	1
together	1
to	1
judgment.	1
	1
41:2	1
Who	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
righteous	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
foot,	1
gave	1
the	1
nations	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
rule	1
over	1
kings?	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
to	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
as	1
driven	1
stubble	1
to	1
his	1
bow.	1
	1
41:3	1
He	1
pursued	1
them,	1
and	1
passed	1
safely;	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
with	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
41:4	1
Who	1
hath	1
wrought	1
and	1
done	1
it,	1
calling	1
the	1
generations	1
from	1
the	1
beginning?	1
I	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
last;	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
41:5	1
The	1
isles	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
feared;	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
afraid,	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
came.	1
	1
41:6	1
They	1
helped	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage.	1
	1
41:7	1
So	1
the	1
carpenter	1
encouraged	1
the	1
goldsmith,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
smootheth	1
with	1
the	1
hammer	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
anvil,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
sodering:	1
and	1
he	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
nails,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved.	1
	1
41:8	1
But	1
thou,	1
Israel,	1
art	1
my	1
servant,	1
Jacob	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen,	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham	1
my	1
friend.	1
	1
41:9	1
Thou	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
called	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
thereof,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant;	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
and	1
not	1
cast	1
thee	1
away.	1
	1
41:10	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee:	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
uphold	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
righteousness.	1
	1
41:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
incensed	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
nothing;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
41:12	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
seek	1
them,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
find	1
them,	1
even	1
them	1
that	1
contended	1
with	1
thee:	1
they	1
that	1
war	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
nothing,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought.	1
	1
41:13	1
For	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
hold	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
saying	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee.	1
	1
41:14	1
Fear	1
not,	1
thou	1
worm	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
41:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
new	1
sharp	1
threshing	1
instrument	1
having	1
teeth:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
thresh	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
beat	1
them	1
small,	1
and	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
hills	1
as	1
chaff.	1
	1
41:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fan	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
scatter	1
them:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shalt	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
41:17	1
When	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy	1
seek	1
water,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
faileth	1
for	1
thirst,	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
hear	1
them,	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
them.	1
	1
41:18	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
rivers	1
in	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
fountains	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
valleys:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
springs	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
41:19	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
the	1
cedar,	1
the	1
shittah	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
myrtle,	1
and	1
the	1
oil	1
tree;	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
pine,	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
tree	1
together:	1
41:20	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
know,	1
and	1
consider,	1
and	1
understand	1
together,	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
this,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
created	1
it.	1
	1
41:21	1
Produce	1
your	1
cause,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
bring	1
forth	1
your	1
strong	1
reasons,	1
saith	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
41:22	1
Let	1
them	1
bring	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
shew	1
us	1
what	1
shall	1
happen:	1
let	1
them	1
shew	1
the	1
former	1
things,	1
what	1
they	1
be,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
consider	1
them,	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
them;	1
or	1
declare	1
us	1
things	1
for	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
41:23	1
Shew	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
hereafter,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
gods:	1
yea,	1
do	1
good,	1
or	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
and	1
behold	1
it	1
together.	1
	1
41:24	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
nothing,	1
and	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
nought:	1
an	1
abomination	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
chooseth	1
you.	1
	1
41:25	1
I	1
have	1
raised	1
up	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come:	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
he	1
call	1
upon	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
princes	1
as	1
upon	1
morter,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
potter	1
treadeth	1
clay.	1
	1
41:26	1
Who	1
hath	1
declared	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know?	1
and	1
beforetime,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
say,	1
He	1
is	1
righteous?	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
sheweth,	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
declareth,	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
heareth	1
your	1
words.	1
	1
41:27	1
The	1
first	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
Zion,	1
Behold,	1
behold	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
one	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings.	1
	1
41:28	1
For	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man;	1
even	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
counsellor,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
of	1
them,	1
could	1
answer	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
41:29	1
Behold,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
vanity;	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
nothing:	1
their	1
molten	1
images	1
are	1
wind	1
and	1
confusion.	1
	1
42:1	1
Behold	1
my	1
servant,	1
whom	1
I	1
uphold;	1
mine	1
elect,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
delighteth;	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
42:2	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
cry,	1
nor	1
lift	1
up,	1
nor	1
cause	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
42:3	1
A	1
bruised	1
reed	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
smoking	1
flax	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
quench:	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
judgment	1
unto	1
truth.	1
	1
42:4	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
nor	1
be	1
discouraged,	1
till	1
he	1
have	1
set	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
law.	1
	1
42:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
God	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
that	1
created	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
stretched	1
them	1
out;	1
he	1
that	1
spread	1
forth	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
it;	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
breath	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
spirit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
therein:	1
42:6	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
called	1
thee	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
will	1
hold	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
42:7	1
To	1
open	1
the	1
blind	1
eyes,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
prisoners	1
from	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
house.	1
	1
42:8	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
my	1
glory	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
to	1
another,	1
neither	1
my	1
praise	1
to	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
42:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
new	1
things	1
do	1
I	1
declare:	1
before	1
they	1
spring	1
forth	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
42:10	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
and	1
his	1
praise	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
ye	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein;	1
the	1
isles,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
42:11	1
Let	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
the	1
villages	1
that	1
Kedar	1
doth	1
inhabit:	1
let	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
sing,	1
let	1
them	1
shout	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
42:12	1
Let	1
them	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
declare	1
his	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
islands.	1
	1
42:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
jealousy	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war:	1
he	1
shall	1
cry,	1
yea,	1
roar;	1
he	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
42:14	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
time	1
holden	1
my	1
peace;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
still,	1
and	1
refrained	1
myself:	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
cry	1
like	1
a	1
travailing	1
woman;	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
and	1
devour	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
42:15	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
waste	1
mountains	1
and	1
hills,	1
and	1
dry	1
up	1
all	1
their	1
herbs;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
rivers	1
islands,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dry	1
up	1
the	1
pools.	1
	1
42:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
blind	1
by	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
them	1
in	1
paths	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
darkness	1
light	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
crooked	1
things	1
straight.	1
These	1
things	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
forsake	1
them.	1
	1
42:17	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
back,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
greatly	1
ashamed,	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
graven	1
images,	1
that	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
molten	1
images,	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
gods.	1
	1
42:18	1
Hear,	1
ye	1
deaf;	1
and	1
look,	1
ye	1
blind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
see.	1
	1
42:19	1
Who	1
is	1
blind,	1
but	1
my	1
servant?	1
or	1
deaf,	1
as	1
my	1
messenger	1
that	1
I	1
sent?	1
	1
who	1
is	1
blind	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
perfect,	1
and	1
blind	1
as	1
the	1
LORD's	1
servant?	1
	1
42:20	1
Seeing	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
thou	1
observest	1
not;	1
opening	1
the	1
ears,	1
but	1
he	1
heareth	1
not.	1
	1
42:21	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
well	1
pleased	1
for	1
his	1
righteousness'	1
sake;	1
he	1
will	1
magnify	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
honourable.	1
	1
42:22	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
robbed	1
and	1
spoiled;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
snared	1
in	1
holes,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
in	1
prison	1
houses:	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
none	1
delivereth;	1
for	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
none	1
saith,	1
Restore.	1
	1
42:23	1
Who	1
among	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
this?	1
who	1
will	1
hearken	1
and	1
hear	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
42:24	1
Who	1
gave	1
Jacob	1
for	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
Israel	1
to	1
the	1
robbers?	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
against	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
sinned?	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
neither	1
were	1
they	1
obedient	1
unto	1
his	1
law.	1
	1
42:25	1
Therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
battle:	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
fire	1
round	1
about,	1
yet	1
he	1
knew	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
burned	1
him,	1
yet	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
43:1	1
But	1
now	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
created	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
thee,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name;	1
thou	1
art	1
mine.	1
	1
43:2	1
When	1
thou	1
passest	1
through	1
the	1
waters,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
rivers,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
overflow	1
thee:	1
when	1
thou	1
walkest	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
burned;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
flame	1
kindle	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
43:3	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
Saviour:	1
I	1
gave	1
Egypt	1
for	1
thy	1
ransom,	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
Seba	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
43:4	1
Since	1
thou	1
wast	1
precious	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
honourable,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
men	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
people	1
for	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
43:5	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
gather	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
west;	1
43:6	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
north,	1
Give	1
up;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
Keep	1
not	1
back:	1
bring	1
my	1
sons	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
my	1
daughters	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
43:7	1
Even	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
him	1
for	1
my	1
glory,	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
him;	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
him.	1
	1
43:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
blind	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
that	1
have	1
ears.	1
	1
43:9	1
Let	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
assembled:	1
who	1
among	1
them	1
can	1
declare	1
this,	1
and	1
shew	1
us	1
former	1
things?	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
forth	1
their	1
witnesses,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
justified:	1
or	1
let	1
them	1
hear,	1
and	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
43:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
witnesses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
and	1
believe	1
me,	1
and	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
before	1
me	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
God	1
formed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
43:11	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
beside	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saviour.	1
	1
43:12	1
I	1
have	1
declared,	1
and	1
have	1
saved,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
shewed,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strange	1
god	1
among	1
you:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
witnesses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
God.	1
	1
43:13	1
Yea,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand:	1
I	1
will	1
work,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
let	1
it?	1
	1
43:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
your	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
For	1
your	1
sake	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
down	1
all	1
their	1
nobles,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
whose	1
cry	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
ships.	1
	1
43:15	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
your	1
Holy	1
One,	1
the	1
creator	1
of	1
Israel,	1
your	1
King.	1
	1
43:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
maketh	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
a	1
path	1
in	1
the	1
mighty	1
waters;	1
43:17	1
Which	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
the	1
chariot	1
and	1
horse,	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
power;	1
they	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
together,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
rise:	1
they	1
are	1
extinct,	1
they	1
are	1
quenched	1
as	1
tow.	1
	1
43:18	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
former	1
things,	1
neither	1
consider	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
43:19	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
a	1
new	1
thing;	1
now	1
it	1
shall	1
spring	1
forth;	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
it?	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
rivers	1
in	1
the	1
desert.	1
	1
43:20	1
The	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
honour	1
me,	1
the	1
dragons	1
and	1
the	1
owls:	1
because	1
I	1
give	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
rivers	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
to	1
give	1
drink	1
to	1
my	1
people,	1
my	1
chosen.	1
	1
43:21	1
This	1
people	1
have	1
I	1
formed	1
for	1
myself;	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
my	1
praise.	1
	1
43:22	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
called	1
upon	1
me,	1
O	1
Jacob;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
weary	1
of	1
me,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
43:23	1
Thou	1
hast	1
not	1
brought	1
me	1
the	1
small	1
cattle	1
of	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings;	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
honoured	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
sacrifices.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
an	1
offering,	1
nor	1
wearied	1
thee	1
with	1
incense.	1
	1
43:24	1
Thou	1
hast	1
bought	1
me	1
no	1
sweet	1
cane	1
with	1
money,	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
thy	1
sacrifices:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
thy	1
sins,	1
thou	1
hast	1
wearied	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
iniquities.	1
	1
43:25	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
blotteth	1
out	1
thy	1
transgressions	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
remember	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
43:26	1
Put	1
me	1
in	1
remembrance:	1
let	1
us	1
plead	1
together:	1
declare	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
43:27	1
Thy	1
first	1
father	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
and	1
thy	1
teachers	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
43:28	1
Therefore	1
I	1
have	1
profaned	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
Jacob	1
to	1
the	1
curse,	1
and	1
Israel	1
to	1
reproaches.	1
	1
44:1	1
Yet	1
now	1
hear,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
44:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
made	1
thee,	1
and	1
formed	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
which	1
will	1
help	1
thee;	1
Fear	1
not,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
thou,	1
Jesurun,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen.	1
	1
44:3	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
water	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
floods	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
ground:	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
thy	1
seed,	1
and	1
my	1
blessing	1
upon	1
thine	1
offspring:	1
44:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
spring	1
up	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
grass,	1
as	1
willows	1
by	1
the	1
water	1
courses.	1
	1
44:5	1
One	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD's;	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
call	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
subscribe	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
surname	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
44:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
redeemer	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last;	1
and	1
beside	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
	1
44:7	1
And	1
who,	1
as	1
I,	1
shall	1
call,	1
and	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
for	1
me,	1
since	1
I	1
appointed	1
the	1
ancient	1
people?	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
coming,	1
and	1
shall	1
come,	1
let	1
them	1
shew	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
44:8	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
afraid:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
from	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
have	1
declared	1
it?	1
ye	1
are	1
even	1
my	1
witnesses.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
God	1
beside	1
me?	1
yea,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God;	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
any.	1
	1
44:9	1
They	1
that	1
make	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
vanity;	1
and	1
their	1
delectable	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
profit;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
their	1
own	1
witnesses;	1
they	1
see	1
not,	1
nor	1
know;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
44:10	1
Who	1
hath	1
formed	1
a	1
god,	1
or	1
molten	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
that	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
nothing?	1
	1
44:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
his	1
fellows	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
the	1
workmen,	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
men:	1
let	1
them	1
all	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
let	1
them	1
stand	1
up;	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
fear,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
together.	1
	1
44:12	1
The	1
smith	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
both	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
coals,	1
and	1
fashioneth	1
it	1
with	1
hammers,	1
and	1
worketh	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
arms:	1
yea,	1
he	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
faileth:	1
he	1
drinketh	1
no	1
water,	1
and	1
is	1
faint.	1
	1
44:13	1
The	1
carpenter	1
stretcheth	1
out	1
his	1
rule;	1
he	1
marketh	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
line;	1
he	1
fitteth	1
it	1
with	1
planes,	1
and	1
he	1
marketh	1
it	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
compass,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
44:14	1
He	1
heweth	1
him	1
down	1
cedars,	1
and	1
taketh	1
the	1
cypress	1
and	1
the	1
oak,	1
which	1
he	1
strengtheneth	1
for	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
forest:	1
he	1
planteth	1
an	1
ash,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
doth	1
nourish	1
it.	1
	1
44:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
burn:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
thereof,	1
and	1
warm	1
himself;	1
yea,	1
he	1
kindleth	1
it,	1
and	1
baketh	1
bread;	1
yea,	1
he	1
maketh	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
it;	1
he	1
maketh	1
it	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
falleth	1
down	1
thereto.	1
	1
44:16	1
He	1
burneth	1
part	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
with	1
part	1
thereof	1
he	1
eateth	1
flesh;	1
he	1
roasteth	1
roast,	1
and	1
is	1
satisfied:	1
yea,	1
he	1
warmeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Aha,	1
I	1
am	1
warm,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
fire:	1
44:17	1
And	1
the	1
residue	1
thereof	1
he	1
maketh	1
a	1
god,	1
even	1
his	1
graven	1
image:	1
he	1
falleth	1
down	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
it,	1
and	1
prayeth	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Deliver	1
me;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
god.	1
	1
44:18	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
nor	1
understood:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
shut	1
their	1
eyes,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
see;	1
and	1
their	1
hearts,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
understand.	1
	1
44:19	1
And	1
none	1
considereth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
knowledge	1
nor	1
understanding	1
to	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
burned	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
yea,	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
baked	1
bread	1
upon	1
the	1
coals	1
thereof;	1
I	1
have	1
roasted	1
flesh,	1
and	1
eaten	1
it:	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
residue	1
thereof	1
an	1
abomination?	1
shall	1
I	1
fall	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
a	1
tree?	1
	1
44:20	1
He	1
feedeth	1
on	1
ashes:	1
a	1
deceived	1
heart	1
hath	1
turned	1
him	1
aside,	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul,	1
nor	1
say,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
lie	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand?	1
	1
44:21	1
Remember	1
these,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Israel;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant:	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
thee;	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant:	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
44:22	1
I	1
have	1
blotted	1
out,	1
as	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud,	1
thy	1
transgressions,	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
cloud,	1
thy	1
sins:	1
return	1
unto	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
thee.	1
	1
44:23	1
Sing,	1
O	1
ye	1
heavens;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
it:	1
shout,	1
ye	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
ye	1
mountains,	1
O	1
forest,	1
and	1
every	1
tree	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
glorified	1
himself	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
44:24	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
redeemer,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
formed	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
maketh	1
all	1
things;	1
that	1
stretcheth	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens	1
alone;	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
abroad	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
myself;	1
44:25	1
That	1
frustrateth	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
the	1
liars,	1
and	1
maketh	1
diviners	1
mad;	1
that	1
turneth	1
wise	1
men	1
backward,	1
and	1
maketh	1
their	1
knowledge	1
foolish;	1
44:26	1
That	1
confirmeth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
performeth	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
messengers;	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
inhabited;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
built,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
decayed	1
places	1
thereof:	1
44:27	1
That	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
deep,	1
Be	1
dry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dry	1
up	1
thy	1
rivers:	1
44:28	1
That	1
saith	1
of	1
Cyrus,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
shall	1
perform	1
all	1
my	1
pleasure:	1
even	1
saying	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
temple,	1
Thy	1
foundation	1
shall	1
be	1
laid.	1
	1
45:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
his	1
anointed,	1
to	1
Cyrus,	1
whose	1
right	1
hand	1
I	1
have	1
holden,	1
to	1
subdue	1
nations	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
loose	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
kings,	1
to	1
open	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
two	1
leaved	1
gates;	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut;	1
45:2	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
crooked	1
places	1
straight:	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
cut	1
in	1
sunder	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
iron:	1
45:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hidden	1
riches	1
of	1
secret	1
places,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
I,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
call	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
45:4	1
For	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
and	1
Israel	1
mine	1
elect,	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
called	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
name:	1
I	1
have	1
surnamed	1
thee,	1
though	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
me.	1
	1
45:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
beside	1
me:	1
I	1
girded	1
thee,	1
though	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
me:	1
45:6	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:7	1
I	1
form	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
create	1
darkness:	1
I	1
make	1
peace,	1
and	1
create	1
evil:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
45:8	1
Drop	1
down,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
skies	1
pour	1
down	1
righteousness:	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
open,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
forth	1
salvation,	1
and	1
let	1
righteousness	1
spring	1
up	1
together;	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
created	1
it.	1
	1
45:9	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
striveth	1
with	1
his	1
Maker!	1
Let	1
the	1
potsherd	1
strive	1
with	1
the	1
potsherds	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Shall	1
the	1
clay	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
fashioneth	1
it,	1
What	1
makest	1
thou?	1
or	1
thy	1
work,	1
He	1
hath	1
no	1
hands?	1
	1
45:10	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
What	1
begettest	1
thou?	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
forth?	1
	1
45:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
Maker,	1
Ask	1
me	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come	1
concerning	1
my	1
sons,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
command	1
ye	1
me.	1
	1
45:12	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
created	1
man	1
upon	1
it:	1
I,	1
even	1
my	1
hands,	1
have	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
host	1
have	1
I	1
commanded.	1
	1
45:13	1
I	1
have	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
direct	1
all	1
his	1
ways:	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
my	1
city,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
go	1
my	1
captives,	1
not	1
for	1
price	1
nor	1
reward,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
45:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
labour	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
merchandise	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sabeans,	1
men	1
of	1
stature,	1
shall	1
come	1
over	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
thine:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
after	1
thee;	1
in	1
chains	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
over,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
unto	1
thee,	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
supplication	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God.	1
	1
45:15	1
Verily	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
God	1
that	1
hidest	1
thyself,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
Saviour.	1
	1
45:16	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
also	1
confounded,	1
all	1
of	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
confusion	1
together	1
that	1
are	1
makers	1
of	1
idols.	1
	1
45:17	1
But	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
salvation:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
nor	1
confounded	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
	1
45:18	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
created	1
the	1
heavens;	1
God	1
himself	1
that	1
formed	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
made	1
it;	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
it,	1
he	1
created	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
vain,	1
he	1
formed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:19	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
in	1
secret,	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
me	1
in	1
vain:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
speak	1
righteousness,	1
I	1
declare	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
right.	1
	1
45:20	1
Assemble	1
yourselves	1
and	1
come;	1
draw	1
near	1
together,	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge	1
that	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
their	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
a	1
god	1
that	1
cannot	1
save.	1
	1
45:21	1
Tell	1
ye,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
near;	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
counsel	1
together:	1
who	1
hath	1
declared	1
this	1
from	1
ancient	1
time?	1
who	1
hath	1
told	1
it	1
from	1
that	1
time?	1
	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
else	1
beside	1
me;	1
a	1
just	1
God	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
45:22	1
Look	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
saved,	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
45:23	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
myself,	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
That	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow,	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
swear.	1
	1
45:24	1
Surely,	1
shall	1
one	1
say,	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
I	1
righteousness	1
and	1
strength:	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
men	1
come;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
incensed	1
against	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
45:25	1
In	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
justified,	1
and	1
shall	1
glory.	1
	1
46:1	1
Bel	1
boweth	1
down,	1
Nebo	1
stoopeth,	1
their	1
idols	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle:	1
your	1
carriages	1
were	1
heavy	1
loaden;	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
the	1
weary	1
beast.	1
	1
46:2	1
They	1
stoop,	1
they	1
bow	1
down	1
together;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
deliver	1
the	1
burden,	1
but	1
themselves	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
46:3	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
borne	1
by	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
belly,	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
46:4	1
And	1
even	1
to	1
your	1
old	1
age	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
hoar	1
hairs	1
will	1
I	1
carry	1
you:	1
I	1
have	1
made,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bear;	1
even	1
I	1
will	1
carry,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
you.	1
	1
46:5	1
To	1
whom	1
will	1
ye	1
liken	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
equal,	1
and	1
compare	1
me,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
like?	1
	1
46:6	1
They	1
lavish	1
gold	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
weigh	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
balance,	1
and	1
hire	1
a	1
goldsmith;	1
and	1
he	1
maketh	1
it	1
a	1
god:	1
they	1
fall	1
down,	1
yea,	1
they	1
worship.	1
	1
46:7	1
They	1
bear	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
they	1
carry	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
he	1
standeth;	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
remove:	1
yea,	1
one	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
him,	1
yet	1
can	1
he	1
not	1
answer,	1
nor	1
save	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
trouble.	1
	1
46:8	1
Remember	1
this,	1
and	1
shew	1
yourselves	1
men:	1
bring	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
mind,	1
O	1
ye	1
transgressors.	1
	1
46:9	1
Remember	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
of	1
old:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else;	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
me,	1
46:10	1
Declaring	1
the	1
end	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
from	1
ancient	1
times	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
done,	1
saying,	1
My	1
counsel	1
shall	1
stand,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
pleasure:	1
46:11	1
Calling	1
a	1
ravenous	1
bird	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
executeth	1
my	1
counsel	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
pass;	1
I	1
have	1
purposed	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
46:12	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
stouthearted,	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
righteousness:	1
46:13	1
I	1
bring	1
near	1
my	1
righteousness;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
my	1
salvation	1
shall	1
not	1
tarry:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
salvation	1
in	1
Zion	1
for	1
Israel	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
47:1	1
Come	1
down,	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
dust,	1
O	1
virgin	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
throne,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
tender	1
and	1
delicate.	1
	1
47:2	1
Take	1
the	1
millstones,	1
and	1
grind	1
meal:	1
uncover	1
thy	1
locks,	1
make	1
bare	1
the	1
leg,	1
uncover	1
the	1
thigh,	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
rivers.	1
	1
47:3	1
Thy	1
nakedness	1
shall	1
be	1
uncovered,	1
yea,	1
thy	1
shame	1
shall	1
be	1
seen:	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
47:4	1
As	1
for	1
our	1
redeemer,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
47:5	1
Sit	1
thou	1
silent,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
darkness,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
lady	1
of	1
kingdoms.	1
	1
47:6	1
I	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
my	1
people,	1
I	1
have	1
polluted	1
mine	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand:	1
thou	1
didst	1
shew	1
them	1
no	1
mercy;	1
upon	1
the	1
ancient	1
hast	1
thou	1
very	1
heavily	1
laid	1
thy	1
yoke.	1
	1
47:7	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
lady	1
for	1
ever:	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
lay	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
thy	1
heart,	1
neither	1
didst	1
remember	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
47:8	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
now	1
this,	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
given	1
to	1
pleasures,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
carelessly,	1
that	1
sayest	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
none	1
else	1
beside	1
me;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
widow,	1
neither	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
children:	1
47:9	1
But	1
these	1
two	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
children,	1
and	1
widowhood:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
perfection	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
sorceries,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
abundance	1
of	1
thine	1
enchantments.	1
	1
47:10	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
trusted	1
in	1
thy	1
wickedness:	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
None	1
seeth	1
me.	1
Thy	1
wisdom	1
and	1
thy	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
hath	1
perverted	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
none	1
else	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
47:11	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
evil	1
come	1
upon	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
from	1
whence	1
it	1
riseth:	1
and	1
mischief	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
off:	1
and	1
desolation	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee	1
suddenly,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know.	1
	1
47:12	1
Stand	1
now	1
with	1
thine	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
sorceries,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured	1
from	1
thy	1
youth;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
profit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prevail.	1
	1
47:13	1
Thou	1
art	1
wearied	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
counsels.	1
Let	1
now	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
stargazers,	1
the	1
monthly	1
prognosticators,	1
stand	1
up,	1
and	1
save	1
thee	1
from	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
47:14	1
Behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
stubble;	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
burn	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
flame:	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
coal	1
to	1
warm	1
at,	1
nor	1
fire	1
to	1
sit	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
47:15	1
Thus	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
even	1
thy	1
merchants,	1
from	1
thy	1
youth:	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
quarter;	1
none	1
shall	1
save	1
thee.	1
	1
48:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
truth,	1
nor	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
48:2	1
For	1
they	1
call	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
stay	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
48:3	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
shewed	1
them;	1
I	1
did	1
them	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
48:4	1
Because	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
obstinate,	1
and	1
thy	1
neck	1
is	1
an	1
iron	1
sinew,	1
and	1
thy	1
brow	1
brass;	1
48:5	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
thee;	1
before	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
I	1
shewed	1
it	1
thee:	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Mine	1
idol	1
hath	1
done	1
them,	1
and	1
my	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
my	1
molten	1
image,	1
hath	1
commanded	1
them.	1
	1
48:6	1
Thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
see	1
all	1
this;	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
ye	1
declare	1
it?	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
thee	1
new	1
things	1
from	1
this	1
time,	1
even	1
hidden	1
things,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
48:7	1
They	1
are	1
created	1
now,	1
and	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
thou	1
heardest	1
them	1
not;	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
knew	1
them.	1
	1
48:8	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
heardest	1
not;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not;	1
yea,	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
that	1
thine	1
ear	1
was	1
not	1
opened:	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
deal	1
very	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
wast	1
called	1
a	1
transgressor	1
from	1
the	1
womb.	1
	1
48:9	1
For	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
will	1
I	1
defer	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
praise	1
will	1
I	1
refrain	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
cut	1
thee	1
not	1
off.	1
	1
48:10	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
refined	1
thee,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
silver;	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
affliction.	1
	1
48:11	1
For	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
even	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
it:	1
for	1
how	1
should	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
polluted?	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
my	1
glory	1
unto	1
another.	1
	1
48:12	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Israel,	1
my	1
called;	1
I	1
am	1
he;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first,	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
48:13	1
Mine	1
hand	1
also	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
hath	1
spanned	1
the	1
heavens:	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
stand	1
up	1
together.	1
	1
48:14	1
All	1
ye,	1
assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
hear;	1
which	1
among	1
them	1
hath	1
declared	1
these	1
things?	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
loved	1
him:	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
his	1
pleasure	1
on	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
48:15	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
have	1
spoken;	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
him:	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
his	1
way	1
prosperous.	1
	1
48:16	1
Come	1
ye	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
hear	1
ye	1
this;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
in	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
beginning;	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
was,	1
there	1
am	1
I:	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
and	1
his	1
Spirit,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
48:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
which	1
teacheth	1
thee	1
to	1
profit,	1
which	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
go.	1
	1
48:18	1
O	1
that	1
thou	1
hadst	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
commandments!	1
then	1
had	1
thy	1
peace	1
been	1
as	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
48:19	1
Thy	1
seed	1
also	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
the	1
sand,	1
and	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels	1
like	1
the	1
gravel	1
thereof;	1
his	1
name	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
nor	1
destroyed	1
from	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
48:20	1
Go	1
ye	1
forth	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
flee	1
ye	1
from	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
singing	1
declare	1
ye,	1
tell	1
this,	1
utter	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
say	1
ye,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
his	1
servant	1
Jacob.	1
	1
48:21	1
And	1
they	1
thirsted	1
not	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
deserts:	1
he	1
caused	1
the	1
waters	1
to	1
flow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
for	1
them:	1
he	1
clave	1
the	1
rock	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
48:22	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
49:1	1
Listen,	1
O	1
isles,	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
people,	1
from	1
far;	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
womb;	1
from	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
my	1
mother	1
hath	1
he	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
49:2	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
my	1
mouth	1
like	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword;	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
he	1
hid	1
me,	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
polished	1
shaft;	1
in	1
his	1
quiver	1
hath	1
he	1
hid	1
me;	1
49:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
49:4	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain,	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
my	1
strength	1
for	1
nought,	1
and	1
in	1
vain:	1
yet	1
surely	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
work	1
with	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
49:5	1
And	1
now,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
formed	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
servant,	1
to	1
bring	1
Jacob	1
again	1
to	1
him,	1
Though	1
Israel	1
be	1
not	1
gathered,	1
yet	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
glorious	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
strength.	1
	1
49:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
my	1
servant	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
preserved	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
my	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
49:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
his	1
Holy	1
One,	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
man	1
despiseth,	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
the	1
nation	1
abhorreth,	1
to	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
rulers,	1
Kings	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
arise,	1
princes	1
also	1
shall	1
worship,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
is	1
faithful,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
choose	1
thee.	1
	1
49:8	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
In	1
an	1
acceptable	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
helped	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
cause	1
to	1
inherit	1
the	1
desolate	1
heritages;	1
49:9	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
Go	1
forth;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
Shew	1
yourselves.	1
They	1
shall	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
ways,	1
and	1
their	1
pastures	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
49:10	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hunger	1
nor	1
thirst;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
heat	1
nor	1
sun	1
smite	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
them	1
shall	1
lead	1
them,	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
water	1
shall	1
he	1
guide	1
them.	1
	1
49:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
my	1
mountains	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
my	1
highways	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
49:12	1
Behold,	1
these	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
these	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west;	1
and	1
these	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sinim.	1
	1
49:13	1
Sing,	1
O	1
heavens;	1
and	1
be	1
joyful,	1
O	1
earth;	1
and	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
O	1
mountains:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
his	1
afflicted.	1
	1
49:14	1
But	1
Zion	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
Lord	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
49:15	1
Can	1
a	1
woman	1
forget	1
her	1
sucking	1
child,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
her	1
womb?	1
yea,	1
they	1
may	1
forget,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
forget	1
thee.	1
	1
49:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
graven	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
my	1
hands;	1
thy	1
walls	1
are	1
continually	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
49:17	1
Thy	1
children	1
shall	1
make	1
haste;	1
thy	1
destroyers	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
made	1
thee	1
waste	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
49:18	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
behold:	1
all	1
these	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
clothe	1
thee	1
with	1
them	1
all,	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
ornament,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
on	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
doeth.	1
	1
49:19	1
For	1
thy	1
waste	1
and	1
thy	1
desolate	1
places,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
destruction,	1
shall	1
even	1
now	1
be	1
too	1
narrow	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
swallowed	1
thee	1
up	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
away.	1
	1
49:20	1
The	1
children	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have,	1
after	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost	1
the	1
other,	1
shall	1
say	1
again	1
in	1
thine	1
ears,	1
The	1
place	1
is	1
too	1
strait	1
for	1
me:	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell.	1
	1
49:21	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
hath	1
begotten	1
me	1
these,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
am	1
desolate,	1
a	1
captive,	1
and	1
removing	1
to	1
and	1
fro?	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
brought	1
up	1
these?	1
Behold,	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
alone;	1
these,	1
where	1
had	1
they	1
been?	1
	1
49:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
standard	1
to	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
thy	1
sons	1
in	1
their	1
arms,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
49:23	1
And	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
nursing	1
fathers,	1
and	1
their	1
queens	1
thy	1
nursing	1
mothers:	1
they	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
lick	1
up	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
thy	1
feet;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
49:24	1
Shall	1
the	1
prey	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
mighty,	1
or	1
the	1
lawful	1
captive	1
delivered?	1
	1
49:25	1
But	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Even	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
contendeth	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
49:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
that	1
oppress	1
thee	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
flesh;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
drunken	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
blood,	1
as	1
with	1
sweet	1
wine:	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
thy	1
Saviour	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
50:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
your	1
mother's	1
divorcement,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
away?	1
or	1
which	1
of	1
my	1
creditors	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sold	1
you?	1
	1
Behold,	1
for	1
your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
ye	1
sold	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
transgressions	1
is	1
your	1
mother	1
put	1
away.	1
	1
50:2	1
Wherefore,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
man?	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
was	1
there	1
none	1
to	1
answer?	1
Is	1
my	1
hand	1
shortened	1
at	1
all,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
redeem?	1
or	1
have	1
I	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
deliver?	1
behold,	1
at	1
my	1
rebuke	1
I	1
dry	1
up	1
the	1
sea,	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
rivers	1
a	1
wilderness:	1
their	1
fish	1
stinketh,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
water,	1
and	1
dieth	1
for	1
thirst.	1
	1
50:3	1
I	1
clothe	1
the	1
heavens	1
with	1
blackness,	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
sackcloth	1
their	1
covering.	1
	1
50:4	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
learned,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
season	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
weary:	1
he	1
wakeneth	1
morning	1
by	1
morning,	1
he	1
wakeneth	1
mine	1
ear	1
to	1
hear	1
as	1
the	1
learned.	1
	1
50:5	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
ear,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
rebellious,	1
neither	1
turned	1
away	1
back.	1
	1
50:6	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
smiters,	1
and	1
my	1
cheeks	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
plucked	1
off	1
the	1
hair:	1
I	1
hid	1
not	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
shame	1
and	1
spitting.	1
	1
50:7	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
help	1
me;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
be	1
confounded:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
flint,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
50:8	1
He	1
is	1
near	1
that	1
justifieth	1
me;	1
who	1
will	1
contend	1
with	1
me?	1
let	1
us	1
stand	1
together:	1
who	1
is	1
mine	1
adversary?	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
50:9	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
help	1
me;	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
condemn	1
me?	1
	1
lo,	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
a	1
garment;	1
the	1
moth	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
50:10	1
Who	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
feareth	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
no	1
light?	1
let	1
him	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
stay	1
upon	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
50:11	1
Behold,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire,	1
that	1
compass	1
yourselves	1
about	1
with	1
sparks:	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
your	1
fire,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sparks	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
kindled.	1
This	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
mine	1
hand;	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
sorrow.	1
	1
51:1	1
Hearken	1
to	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
ye	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD:	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
whence	1
ye	1
are	1
hewn,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
whence	1
ye	1
are	1
digged.	1
	1
51:2	1
Look	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
that	1
bare	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
called	1
him	1
alone,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
increased	1
him.	1
	1
51:3	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
comfort	1
Zion:	1
he	1
will	1
comfort	1
all	1
her	1
waste	1
places;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
wilderness	1
like	1
Eden,	1
and	1
her	1
desert	1
like	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
therein,	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
melody.	1
	1
51:4	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
give	1
ear	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
nation:	1
for	1
a	1
law	1
shall	1
proceed	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
judgment	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
51:5	1
My	1
righteousness	1
is	1
near;	1
my	1
salvation	1
is	1
gone	1
forth,	1
and	1
mine	1
arms	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
people;	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
mine	1
arm	1
shall	1
they	1
trust.	1
	1
51:6	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath:	1
for	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away	1
like	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
like	1
manner:	1
but	1
my	1
salvation	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
my	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
abolished.	1
	1
51:7	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
know	1
righteousness,	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
my	1
law;	1
fear	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
revilings.	1
	1
51:8	1
For	1
the	1
moth	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
worm	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
like	1
wool:	1
but	1
my	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
my	1
salvation	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
51:9	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
put	1
on	1
strength,	1
O	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
awake,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
ancient	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
old.	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
it	1
that	1
hath	1
cut	1
Rahab,	1
and	1
wounded	1
the	1
dragon?	1
	1
51:10	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
it	1
which	1
hath	1
dried	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deep;	1
that	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
a	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
ransomed	1
to	1
pass	1
over?	1
	1
51:11	1
Therefore	1
the	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
singing	1
unto	1
Zion;	1
and	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
their	1
head:	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
gladness	1
and	1
joy;	1
and	1
sorrow	1
and	1
mourning	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
51:12	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
comforteth	1
you:	1
who	1
art	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
die,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
as	1
grass;	1
51:13	1
And	1
forgettest	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
maker,	1
that	1
hath	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
hast	1
feared	1
continually	1
every	1
day	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
destroy?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor?	1
	1
51:14	1
The	1
captive	1
exile	1
hasteneth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
loosed,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
pit,	1
nor	1
that	1
his	1
bread	1
should	1
fail.	1
	1
51:15	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
divided	1
the	1
sea,	1
whose	1
waves	1
roared:	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
51:16	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
covered	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
plant	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
51:17	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
stand	1
up,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
hast	1
drunk	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
fury;	1
thou	1
hast	1
drunken	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling,	1
and	1
wrung	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
51:18	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
guide	1
her	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
whom	1
she	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
taketh	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
brought	1
up.	1
	1
51:19	1
These	1
two	1
things	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee;	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
desolation,	1
and	1
destruction,	1
and	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
sword:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
comfort	1
thee?	1
	1
51:20	1
Thy	1
sons	1
have	1
fainted,	1
they	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets,	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
bull	1
in	1
a	1
net:	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
rebuke	1
of	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
51:21	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
now	1
this,	1
thou	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
drunken,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
wine:	1
51:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
Lord	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
that	1
pleadeth	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling,	1
even	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
my	1
fury;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
drink	1
it	1
again:	1
51:23	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
afflict	1
thee;	1
which	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
thy	1
soul,	1
Bow	1
down,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
over:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
thy	1
body	1
as	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
street,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
went	1
over.	1
	1
52:1	1
Awake,	1
awake;	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
strength,	1
O	1
Zion;	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
beautiful	1
garments,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
holy	1
city:	1
for	1
henceforth	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
come	1
into	1
thee	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
and	1
the	1
unclean.	1
	1
52:2	1
Shake	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
dust;	1
arise,	1
and	1
sit	1
down,	1
O	1
Jerusalem:	1
loose	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
thy	1
neck,	1
O	1
captive	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
52:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
have	1
sold	1
yourselves	1
for	1
nought;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
redeemed	1
without	1
money.	1
	1
52:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
My	1
people	1
went	1
down	1
aforetime	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
oppressed	1
them	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
52:5	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
here,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
for	1
nought?	1
they	1
that	1
rule	1
over	1
them	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
howl,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
continually	1
every	1
day	1
is	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
52:6	1
Therefore	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
know	1
my	1
name:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
speak:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
I.	1
	1
52:7	1
How	1
beautiful	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
peace;	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
good,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
salvation;	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
Thy	1
God	1
reigneth!	1
	1
52:8	1
Thy	1
watchmen	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
voice;	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
together	1
shall	1
they	1
sing:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
eye	1
to	1
eye,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
Zion.	1
	1
52:9	1
Break	1
forth	1
into	1
joy,	1
sing	1
together,	1
ye	1
waste	1
places	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
comforted	1
his	1
people,	1
he	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
52:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
bare	1
his	1
holy	1
arm	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
52:11	1
Depart	1
ye,	1
depart	1
ye,	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
touch	1
no	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her;	1
be	1
ye	1
clean,	1
that	1
bear	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
52:12	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
haste,	1
nor	1
go	1
by	1
flight:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
rereward.	1
	1
52:13	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
deal	1
prudently,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
and	1
extolled,	1
and	1
be	1
very	1
high.	1
	1
52:14	1
As	1
many	1
were	1
astonied	1
at	1
thee;	1
his	1
visage	1
was	1
so	1
marred	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
man,	1
and	1
his	1
form	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men:	1
52:15	1
So	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
many	1
nations;	1
the	1
kings	1
shall	1
shut	1
their	1
mouths	1
at	1
him:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
them	1
shall	1
they	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
they	1
consider.	1
	1
53:1	1
Who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
revealed?	1
	1
53:2	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
before	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
tender	1
plant,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
root	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
dry	1
ground:	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
form	1
nor	1
comeliness;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
beauty	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
desire	1
him.	1
	1
53:3	1
He	1
is	1
despised	1
and	1
rejected	1
of	1
men;	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sorrows,	1
and	1
acquainted	1
with	1
grief:	1
and	1
we	1
hid	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
our	1
faces	1
from	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
despised,	1
and	1
we	1
esteemed	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
53:4	1
Surely	1
he	1
hath	1
borne	1
our	1
griefs,	1
and	1
carried	1
our	1
sorrows:	1
yet	1
we	1
did	1
esteem	1
him	1
stricken,	1
smitten	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
afflicted.	1
	1
53:5	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
wounded	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions,	1
he	1
was	1
bruised	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities:	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
our	1
peace	1
was	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
stripes	1
we	1
are	1
healed.	1
	1
53:6	1
All	1
we	1
like	1
sheep	1
have	1
gone	1
astray;	1
we	1
have	1
turned	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
way;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
laid	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
53:7	1
He	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
afflicted,	1
yet	1
he	1
opened	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
he	1
is	1
brought	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
before	1
her	1
shearers	1
is	1
dumb,	1
so	1
he	1
openeth	1
not	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
53:8	1
He	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
prison	1
and	1
from	1
judgment:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
for	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
was	1
he	1
stricken.	1
	1
53:9	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
grave	1
with	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
in	1
his	1
death;	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
violence,	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
deceit	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
53:10	1
Yet	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
bruise	1
him;	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
grief:	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
his	1
soul	1
an	1
offering	1
for	1
sin,	1
he	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
seed,	1
he	1
shall	1
prolong	1
his	1
days,	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
53:11	1
He	1
shall	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
travail	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied:	1
by	1
his	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
my	1
righteous	1
servant	1
justify	1
many;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquities.	1
	1
53:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
divide	1
him	1
a	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
great,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil	1
with	1
the	1
strong;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
death:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors;	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
made	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
transgressors.	1
	1
54:1	1
Sing,	1
O	1
barren,	1
thou	1
that	1
didst	1
not	1
bear;	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
singing,	1
and	1
cry	1
aloud,	1
thou	1
that	1
didst	1
not	1
travail	1
with	1
child:	1
for	1
more	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
desolate	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
married	1
wife,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
54:2	1
Enlarge	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
thy	1
tent,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
stretch	1
forth	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
thine	1
habitations:	1
spare	1
not,	1
lengthen	1
thy	1
cords,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
stakes;	1
54:3	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
forth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left;	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
desolate	1
cities	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited.	1
	1
54:4	1
Fear	1
not;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
neither	1
be	1
thou	1
confounded;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
shame:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forget	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
thy	1
widowhood	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
54:5	1
For	1
thy	1
Maker	1
is	1
thine	1
husband;	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name;	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
54:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
forsaken	1
and	1
grieved	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
youth,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
refused,	1
saith	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
54:7	1
For	1
a	1
small	1
moment	1
have	1
I	1
forsaken	1
thee;	1
but	1
with	1
great	1
mercies	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
thee.	1
	1
54:8	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
wrath	1
I	1
hid	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
but	1
with	1
everlasting	1
kindness	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
Redeemer.	1
	1
54:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Noah	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Noah	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
earth;	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
sworn	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wroth	1
with	1
thee,	1
nor	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
54:10	1
For	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
depart,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
be	1
removed;	1
but	1
my	1
kindness	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
my	1
peace	1
be	1
removed,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
hath	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
54:11	1
O	1
thou	1
afflicted,	1
tossed	1
with	1
tempest,	1
and	1
not	1
comforted,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
thy	1
stones	1
with	1
fair	1
colours,	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
foundations	1
with	1
sapphires.	1
	1
54:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
windows	1
of	1
agates,	1
and	1
thy	1
gates	1
of	1
carbuncles,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
borders	1
of	1
pleasant	1
stones.	1
	1
54:13	1
And	1
all	1
thy	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
taught	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
54:14	1
In	1
righteousness	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
established:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
oppression;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
fear:	1
and	1
from	1
terror;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
thee.	1
	1
54:15	1
Behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
gather	1
together,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
me:	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
fall	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
54:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
the	1
smith	1
that	1
bloweth	1
the	1
coals	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
his	1
work;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
the	1
waster	1
to	1
destroy.	1
	1
54:17	1
No	1
weapon	1
that	1
is	1
formed	1
against	1
thee	1
shall	1
prosper;	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
judgment	1
thou	1
shalt	1
condemn.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
righteousness	1
is	1
of	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
55:1	1
Ho,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
thirsteth,	1
come	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
money;	1
come	1
ye,	1
buy,	1
and	1
eat;	1
yea,	1
come,	1
buy	1
wine	1
and	1
milk	1
without	1
money	1
and	1
without	1
price.	1
	1
55:2	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
ye	1
spend	1
money	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
bread?	1
and	1
your	1
labour	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
satisfieth	1
not?	1
hearken	1
diligently	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
eat	1
ye	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
soul	1
delight	1
itself	1
in	1
fatness.	1
	1
55:3	1
Incline	1
your	1
ear,	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
hear,	1
and	1
your	1
soul	1
shall	1
live;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
even	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
55:4	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
a	1
leader	1
and	1
commander	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
55:5	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not,	1
and	1
nations	1
that	1
knew	1
not	1
thee	1
shall	1
run	1
unto	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
glorified	1
thee.	1
	1
55:6	1
Seek	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
while	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
found,	1
call	1
ye	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
near:	1
55:7	1
Let	1
the	1
wicked	1
forsake	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
man	1
his	1
thoughts:	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
God,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
abundantly	1
pardon.	1
	1
55:8	1
For	1
my	1
thoughts	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
thoughts,	1
neither	1
are	1
your	1
ways	1
my	1
ways,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
55:9	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
are	1
my	1
ways	1
higher	1
than	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
my	1
thoughts	1
than	1
your	1
thoughts.	1
	1
55:10	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
rain	1
cometh	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
returneth	1
not	1
thither,	1
but	1
watereth	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
bring	1
forth	1
and	1
bud,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
give	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1
sower,	1
and	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
eater:	1
55:11	1
So	1
shall	1
my	1
word	1
be	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
void,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
accomplish	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
please,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
prosper	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
whereto	1
I	1
sent	1
it.	1
	1
55:12	1
For	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
be	1
led	1
forth	1
with	1
peace:	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
break	1
forth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
singing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
clap	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
55:13	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
thorn	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
brier	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
myrtle	1
tree:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
a	1
name,	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
sign	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
56:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Keep	1
ye	1
judgment,	1
and	1
do	1
justice:	1
for	1
my	1
salvation	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
my	1
righteousness	1
to	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
56:2	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
layeth	1
hold	1
on	1
it;	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sabbath	1
from	1
polluting	1
it,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
doing	1
any	1
evil.	1
	1
56:3	1
Neither	1
let	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
that	1
hath	1
joined	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
utterly	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
his	1
people:	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
eunuch	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
dry	1
tree.	1
	1
56:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
that	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
choose	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
covenant;	1
56:5	1
Even	1
unto	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
and	1
within	1
my	1
walls	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
a	1
name	1
better	1
than	1
of	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
daughters:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
everlasting	1
name,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
56:6	1
Also	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
that	1
join	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
servants,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sabbath	1
from	1
polluting	1
it,	1
and	1
taketh	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
covenant;	1
56:7	1
Even	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
to	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
joyful	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
of	1
prayer:	1
their	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar;	1
for	1
mine	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
prayer	1
for	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
56:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
which	1
gathereth	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Israel	1
saith,	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
others	1
to	1
him,	1
beside	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
56:9	1
All	1
ye	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
come	1
to	1
devour,	1
yea,	1
all	1
ye	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
56:10	1
His	1
watchmen	1
are	1
blind:	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
ignorant,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
dumb	1
dogs,	1
they	1
cannot	1
bark;	1
sleeping,	1
lying	1
down,	1
loving	1
to	1
slumber.	1
	1
56:11	1
Yea,	1
they	1
are	1
greedy	1
dogs	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
have	1
enough,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
shepherds	1
that	1
cannot	1
understand:	1
they	1
all	1
look	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
every	1
one	1
for	1
his	1
gain,	1
from	1
his	1
quarter.	1
	1
56:12	1
Come	1
ye,	1
say	1
they,	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
wine,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
fill	1
ourselves	1
with	1
strong	1
drink;	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
abundant.	1
	1
57:1	1
The	1
righteous	1
perisheth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
layeth	1
it	1
to	1
heart:	1
and	1
merciful	1
men	1
are	1
taken	1
away,	1
none	1
considering	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
57:2	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
peace:	1
they	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
their	1
beds,	1
each	1
one	1
walking	1
in	1
his	1
uprightness.	1
	1
57:3	1
But	1
draw	1
near	1
hither,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
sorceress,	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
adulterer	1
and	1
the	1
whore.	1
	1
57:4	1
Against	1
whom	1
do	1
ye	1
sport	1
yourselves?	1
against	1
whom	1
make	1
ye	1
a	1
wide	1
mouth,	1
and	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
tongue?	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
transgression,	1
a	1
seed	1
of	1
falsehood.	1
	1
57:5	1
Enflaming	1
yourselves	1
with	1
idols	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
slaying	1
the	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
under	1
the	1
clifts	1
of	1
the	1
rocks?	1
	1
57:6	1
Among	1
the	1
smooth	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
is	1
thy	1
portion;	1
they,	1
they	1
are	1
thy	1
lot:	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
hast	1
thou	1
poured	1
a	1
drink	1
offering,	1
thou	1
hast	1
offered	1
a	1
meat	1
offering.	1
Should	1
I	1
receive	1
comfort	1
in	1
these?	1
	1
57:7	1
Upon	1
a	1
lofty	1
and	1
high	1
mountain	1
hast	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
bed:	1
even	1
thither	1
wentest	1
thou	1
up	1
to	1
offer	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
57:8	1
Behind	1
the	1
doors	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
posts	1
hast	1
thou	1
set	1
up	1
thy	1
remembrance:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
discovered	1
thyself	1
to	1
another	1
than	1
me,	1
and	1
art	1
gone	1
up;	1
thou	1
hast	1
enlarged	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
them;	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
their	1
bed	1
where	1
thou	1
sawest	1
it.	1
	1
57:9	1
And	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
didst	1
increase	1
thy	1
perfumes,	1
and	1
didst	1
send	1
thy	1
messengers	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
didst	1
debase	1
thyself	1
even	1
unto	1
hell.	1
	1
57:10	1
Thou	1
art	1
wearied	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
way;	1
yet	1
saidst	1
thou	1
not,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thine	1
hand;	1
therefore	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
grieved.	1
	1
57:11	1
And	1
of	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
been	1
afraid	1
or	1
feared,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
lied,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
remembered	1
me,	1
nor	1
laid	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
heart?	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
held	1
my	1
peace	1
even	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
thou	1
fearest	1
me	1
not?	1
	1
57:12	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
thee.	1
	1
57:13	1
When	1
thou	1
criest,	1
let	1
thy	1
companies	1
deliver	1
thee;	1
but	1
the	1
wind	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
all	1
away;	1
vanity	1
shall	1
take	1
them:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
his	1
trust	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
inherit	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain;	1
57:14	1
And	1
shall	1
say,	1
Cast	1
ye	1
up,	1
cast	1
ye	1
up,	1
prepare	1
the	1
way,	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
57:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
lofty	1
One	1
that	1
inhabiteth	1
eternity,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
Holy;	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
holy	1
place,	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
contrite	1
and	1
humble	1
spirit,	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
humble,	1
and	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
contrite	1
ones.	1
	1
57:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
contend	1
for	1
ever,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
always	1
wroth:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
should	1
fail	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made.	1
	1
57:17	1
For	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
covetousness	1
was	1
I	1
wroth,	1
and	1
smote	1
him:	1
I	1
hid	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
frowardly	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
57:18	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
will	1
heal	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
restore	1
comforts	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
mourners.	1
	1
57:19	1
I	1
create	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
lips;	1
Peace,	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
near,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
him.	1
	1
57:20	1
But	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
troubled	1
sea,	1
when	1
it	1
cannot	1
rest,	1
whose	1
waters	1
cast	1
up	1
mire	1
and	1
dirt.	1
	1
57:21	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
peace,	1
saith	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
58:1	1
Cry	1
aloud,	1
spare	1
not,	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
shew	1
my	1
people	1
their	1
transgression,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
58:2	1
Yet	1
they	1
seek	1
me	1
daily,	1
and	1
delight	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
ways,	1
as	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
did	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
forsook	1
not	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
their	1
God:	1
they	1
ask	1
of	1
me	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
justice;	1
they	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
approaching	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
58:3	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
we	1
fasted,	1
say	1
they,	1
and	1
thou	1
seest	1
not?	1
wherefore	1
have	1
we	1
afflicted	1
our	1
soul,	1
and	1
thou	1
takest	1
no	1
knowledge?	1
Behold,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
fast	1
ye	1
find	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
exact	1
all	1
your	1
labours.	1
	1
58:4	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
fast	1
for	1
strife	1
and	1
debate,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
fist	1
of	1
wickedness:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fast	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
58:5	1
Is	1
it	1
such	1
a	1
fast	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
chosen?	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
afflict	1
his	1
soul?	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
bulrush,	1
and	1
to	1
spread	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes	1
under	1
him?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
call	1
this	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
an	1
acceptable	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
58:6	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
fast	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
chosen?	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
to	1
undo	1
the	1
heavy	1
burdens,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
oppressed	1
go	1
free,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
break	1
every	1
yoke?	1
	1
58:7	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
deal	1
thy	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
bring	1
the	1
poor	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
out	1
to	1
thy	1
house?	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
the	1
naked,	1
that	1
thou	1
cover	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
hide	1
not	1
thyself	1
from	1
thine	1
own	1
flesh?	1
58:8	1
Then	1
shall	1
thy	1
light	1
break	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
thine	1
health	1
shall	1
spring	1
forth	1
speedily:	1
and	1
thy	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee;	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
rereward.	1
	1
58:9	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
call,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
answer;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cry,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
Here	1
I	1
am.	1
If	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
the	1
yoke,	1
the	1
putting	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
finger,	1
and	1
speaking	1
vanity;	1
58:10	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
draw	1
out	1
thy	1
soul	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
satisfy	1
the	1
afflicted	1
soul;	1
then	1
shall	1
thy	1
light	1
rise	1
in	1
obscurity,	1
and	1
thy	1
darkness	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
noon	1
day:	1
58:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
guide	1
thee	1
continually,	1
and	1
satisfy	1
thy	1
soul	1
in	1
drought,	1
and	1
make	1
fat	1
thy	1
bones:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
watered	1
garden,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
spring	1
of	1
water,	1
whose	1
waters	1
fail	1
not.	1
	1
58:12	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
old	1
waste	1
places:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
many	1
generations;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
repairer	1
of	1
the	1
breach,	1
The	1
restorer	1
of	1
paths	1
to	1
dwell	1
in.	1
	1
58:13	1
If	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
from	1
doing	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
on	1
my	1
holy	1
day;	1
and	1
call	1
the	1
sabbath	1
a	1
delight,	1
the	1
holy	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
honourable;	1
and	1
shalt	1
honour	1
him,	1
not	1
doing	1
thine	1
own	1
ways,	1
nor	1
finding	1
thine	1
own	1
pleasure,	1
nor	1
speaking	1
thine	1
own	1
words:	1
58:14	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
delight	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
feed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
heritage	1
of	1
Jacob	1
thy	1
father:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
59:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
shortened,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
save;	1
neither	1
his	1
ear	1
heavy,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
hear:	1
59:2	1
But	1
your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
separated	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
sins	1
have	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
59:3	1
For	1
your	1
hands	1
are	1
defiled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
your	1
fingers	1
with	1
iniquity;	1
your	1
lips	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies,	1
your	1
tongue	1
hath	1
muttered	1
perverseness.	1
	1
59:4	1
None	1
calleth	1
for	1
justice,	1
nor	1
any	1
pleadeth	1
for	1
truth:	1
they	1
trust	1
in	1
vanity,	1
and	1
speak	1
lies;	1
they	1
conceive	1
mischief,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
iniquity.	1
	1
59:5	1
They	1
hatch	1
cockatrice'	1
eggs,	1
and	1
weave	1
the	1
spider's	1
web:	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
their	1
eggs	1
dieth,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
crushed	1
breaketh	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
viper.	1
	1
59:6	1
Their	1
webs	1
shall	1
not	1
become	1
garments,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
cover	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
works:	1
their	1
works	1
are	1
works	1
of	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
violence	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
59:7	1
Their	1
feet	1
run	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
they	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood:	1
their	1
thoughts	1
are	1
thoughts	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
wasting	1
and	1
destruction	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
paths.	1
	1
59:8	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
they	1
know	1
not;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
judgment	1
in	1
their	1
goings:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
crooked	1
paths:	1
whosoever	1
goeth	1
therein	1
shall	1
not	1
know	1
peace.	1
	1
59:9	1
Therefore	1
is	1
judgment	1
far	1
from	1
us,	1
neither	1
doth	1
justice	1
overtake	1
us:	1
we	1
wait	1
for	1
light,	1
but	1
behold	1
obscurity;	1
for	1
brightness,	1
but	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
59:10	1
We	1
grope	1
for	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
the	1
blind,	1
and	1
we	1
grope	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
no	1
eyes:	1
we	1
stumble	1
at	1
noon	1
day	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
desolate	1
places	1
as	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
59:11	1
We	1
roar	1
all	1
like	1
bears,	1
and	1
mourn	1
sore	1
like	1
doves:	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
judgment,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
none;	1
for	1
salvation,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
59:12	1
For	1
our	1
transgressions	1
are	1
multiplied	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
our	1
sins	1
testify	1
against	1
us:	1
for	1
our	1
transgressions	1
are	1
with	1
us;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
we	1
know	1
them;	1
59:13	1
In	1
transgressing	1
and	1
lying	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
departing	1
away	1
from	1
our	1
God,	1
speaking	1
oppression	1
and	1
revolt,	1
conceiving	1
and	1
uttering	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
words	1
of	1
falsehood.	1
	1
59:14	1
And	1
judgment	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
backward,	1
and	1
justice	1
standeth	1
afar	1
off:	1
for	1
truth	1
is	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
equity	1
cannot	1
enter.	1
	1
59:15	1
Yea,	1
truth	1
faileth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
departeth	1
from	1
evil	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prey:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
displeased	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
judgment.	1
	1
59:16	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
wondered	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
intercessor:	1
therefore	1
his	1
arm	1
brought	1
salvation	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
it	1
sustained	1
him.	1
	1
59:17	1
For	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
righteousness	1
as	1
a	1
breastplate,	1
and	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
vengeance	1
for	1
clothing,	1
and	1
was	1
clad	1
with	1
zeal	1
as	1
a	1
cloak.	1
	1
59:18	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
deeds,	1
accordingly	1
he	1
will	1
repay,	1
fury	1
to	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
recompence	1
to	1
his	1
enemies;	1
to	1
the	1
islands	1
he	1
will	1
repay	1
recompence.	1
	1
59:19	1
So	1
shall	1
they	1
fear	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
When	1
the	1
enemy	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
a	1
flood,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
standard	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
59:20	1
And	1
the	1
Redeemer	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
Zion,	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
transgression	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
59:21	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
My	1
spirit	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
seed,	1
nor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
seed's	1
seed,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
henceforth	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
60:1	1
Arise,	1
shine;	1
for	1
thy	1
light	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
risen	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
60:2	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
darkness	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gross	1
darkness	1
the	1
people:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
arise	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
60:3	1
And	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
thy	1
light,	1
and	1
kings	1
to	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
thy	1
rising.	1
	1
60:4	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
see:	1
all	1
they	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together,	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
thee:	1
thy	1
sons	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
nursed	1
at	1
thy	1
side.	1
	1
60:5	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see,	1
and	1
flow	1
together,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
shall	1
fear,	1
and	1
be	1
enlarged;	1
because	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
be	1
converted	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
60:6	1
The	1
multitude	1
of	1
camels	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
the	1
dromedaries	1
of	1
Midian	1
and	1
Ephah;	1
all	1
they	1
from	1
Sheba	1
shall	1
come:	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
gold	1
and	1
incense;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
60:7	1
All	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
Kedar	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
rams	1
of	1
Nebaioth	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
acceptance	1
on	1
mine	1
altar,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
glorify	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
60:8	1
Who	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
fly	1
as	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
doves	1
to	1
their	1
windows?	1
	1
60:9	1
Surely	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
wait	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
first,	1
to	1
bring	1
thy	1
sons	1
from	1
far,	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
with	1
them,	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
glorified	1
thee.	1
	1
60:10	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
strangers	1
shall	1
build	1
up	1
thy	1
walls,	1
and	1
their	1
kings	1
shall	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
wrath	1
I	1
smote	1
thee,	1
but	1
in	1
my	1
favour	1
have	1
I	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
60:11	1
Therefore	1
thy	1
gates	1
shall	1
be	1
open	1
continually;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
day	1
nor	1
night;	1
that	1
men	1
may	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
kings	1
may	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
60:12	1
For	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
kingdom	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
thee	1
shall	1
perish;	1
yea,	1
those	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
wasted.	1
	1
60:13	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
the	1
fir	1
tree,	1
the	1
pine	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
together,	1
to	1
beautify	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
sanctuary;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
feet	1
glorious.	1
	1
60:14	1
The	1
sons	1
also	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
afflicted	1
thee	1
shall	1
come	1
bending	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
despised	1
thee	1
shall	1
bow	1
themselves	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
thy	1
feet;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
thee;	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
Zion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
60:15	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
has	1
been	1
forsaken	1
and	1
hated,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
went	1
through	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
an	1
eternal	1
excellency,	1
a	1
joy	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
60:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
suck	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
shalt	1
suck	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
thy	1
Saviour	1
and	1
thy	1
Redeemer,	1
the	1
mighty	1
One	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
60:17	1
For	1
brass	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
gold,	1
and	1
for	1
iron	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
wood	1
brass,	1
and	1
for	1
stones	1
iron:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
thy	1
officers	1
peace,	1
and	1
thine	1
exactors	1
righteousness.	1
	1
60:18	1
Violence	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
wasting	1
nor	1
destruction	1
within	1
thy	1
borders;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
thy	1
walls	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
thy	1
gates	1
Praise.	1
	1
60:19	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
thy	1
light	1
by	1
day;	1
neither	1
for	1
brightness	1
shall	1
the	1
moon	1
give	1
light	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
an	1
everlasting	1
light,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
60:20	1
Thy	1
sun	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
go	1
down;	1
neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
moon	1
withdraw	1
itself:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
everlasting	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
mourning	1
shall	1
be	1
ended.	1
	1
60:21	1
Thy	1
people	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
righteous:	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
ever,	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
my	1
planting,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
60:22	1
A	1
little	1
one	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
one	1
a	1
strong	1
nation:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
hasten	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
61:1	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
is	1
upon	1
me;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
anointed	1
me	1
to	1
preach	1
good	1
tidings	1
unto	1
the	1
meek;	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
bind	1
up	1
the	1
brokenhearted,	1
to	1
proclaim	1
liberty	1
to	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bound;	1
61:2	1
To	1
proclaim	1
the	1
acceptable	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
to	1
comfort	1
all	1
that	1
mourn;	1
61:3	1
To	1
appoint	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
mourn	1
in	1
Zion,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
beauty	1
for	1
ashes,	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
joy	1
for	1
mourning,	1
the	1
garment	1
of	1
praise	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
heaviness;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
trees	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
the	1
planting	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
61:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
old	1
wastes,	1
they	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
former	1
desolations,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
repair	1
the	1
waste	1
cities,	1
the	1
desolations	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
61:5	1
And	1
strangers	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
feed	1
your	1
flocks,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
alien	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
plowmen	1
and	1
your	1
vinedressers.	1
	1
61:6	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
named	1
the	1
Priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
men	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
the	1
Ministers	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
glory	1
shall	1
ye	1
boast	1
yourselves.	1
	1
61:7	1
For	1
your	1
shame	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
double;	1
and	1
for	1
confusion	1
they	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
their	1
portion:	1
therefore	1
in	1
their	1
land	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
double:	1
everlasting	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
61:8	1
For	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
love	1
judgment,	1
I	1
hate	1
robbery	1
for	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
direct	1
their	1
work	1
in	1
truth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
61:9	1
And	1
their	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
their	1
offspring	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
all	1
that	1
see	1
them	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed.	1
	1
61:10	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
joyful	1
in	1
my	1
God;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
clothed	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
salvation,	1
he	1
hath	1
covered	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
robe	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
as	1
a	1
bridegroom	1
decketh	1
himself	1
with	1
ornaments,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorneth	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
jewels.	1
	1
61:11	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
her	1
bud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
causeth	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
sown	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
spring	1
forth;	1
so	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
cause	1
righteousness	1
and	1
praise	1
to	1
spring	1
forth	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
62:1	1
For	1
Zion's	1
sake	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
and	1
for	1
Jerusalem's	1
sake	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rest,	1
until	1
the	1
righteousness	1
thereof	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
brightness,	1
and	1
the	1
salvation	1
thereof	1
as	1
a	1
lamp	1
that	1
burneth.	1
	1
62:2	1
And	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
all	1
kings	1
thy	1
glory:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
name,	1
which	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
name.	1
	1
62:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
be	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
a	1
royal	1
diadem	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
62:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
termed	1
Forsaken;	1
neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
land	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
termed	1
Desolate:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
Hephzibah,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
Beulah:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
delighteth	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
married.	1
	1
62:5	1
For	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
marrieth	1
a	1
virgin,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
sons	1
marry	1
thee:	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
rejoiceth	1
over	1
the	1
bride,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
God	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee.	1
	1
62:6	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
watchmen	1
upon	1
thy	1
walls,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
shall	1
never	1
hold	1
their	1
peace	1
day	1
nor	1
night:	1
ye	1
that	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
keep	1
not	1
silence,	1
62:7	1
And	1
give	1
him	1
no	1
rest,	1
till	1
he	1
establish,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
62:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
strength,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
give	1
thy	1
corn	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
thine	1
enemies;	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
thy	1
wine,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
laboured:	1
62:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
gathered	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
it,	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
it	1
together	1
shall	1
drink	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
my	1
holiness.	1
	1
62:10	1
Go	1
through,	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
gates;	1
prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
cast	1
up,	1
cast	1
up	1
the	1
highway;	1
gather	1
out	1
the	1
stones;	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
62:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
proclaimed	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
Say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
salvation	1
cometh;	1
behold,	1
his	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
work	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
62:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
them,	1
The	1
holy	1
people,	1
The	1
redeemed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called,	1
Sought	1
out,	1
A	1
city	1
not	1
forsaken.	1
	1
63:1	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
Edom,	1
with	1
dyed	1
garments	1
from	1
Bozrah?	1
	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
glorious	1
in	1
his	1
apparel,	1
travelling	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
strength?	1
I	1
that	1
speak	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
mighty	1
to	1
save.	1
	1
63:2	1
Wherefore	1
art	1
thou	1
red	1
in	1
thine	1
apparel,	1
and	1
thy	1
garments	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
treadeth	1
in	1
the	1
winefat?	1
	1
63:3	1
I	1
have	1
trodden	1
the	1
winepress	1
alone;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
with	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
tread	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
trample	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
fury;	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
my	1
garments,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stain	1
all	1
my	1
raiment.	1
	1
63:4	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
my	1
redeemed	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
63:5	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
help;	1
and	1
I	1
wondered	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
uphold:	1
therefore	1
mine	1
own	1
arm	1
brought	1
salvation	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
my	1
fury,	1
it	1
upheld	1
me.	1
	1
63:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
drunk	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
down	1
their	1
strength	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
63:7	1
I	1
will	1
mention	1
the	1
lovingkindnesses	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
goodness	1
toward	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
on	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercies,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
lovingkindnesses.	1
	1
63:8	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
Surely	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
people,	1
children	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
lie:	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
their	1
Saviour.	1
	1
63:9	1
In	1
all	1
their	1
affliction	1
he	1
was	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
saved	1
them:	1
in	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
pity	1
he	1
redeemed	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
63:10	1
But	1
they	1
rebelled,	1
and	1
vexed	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit:	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
enemy,	1
and	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
63:11	1
Then	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
Moses,	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
his	1
flock?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
put	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
within	1
him?	1
	1
63:12	1
That	1
led	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
with	1
his	1
glorious	1
arm,	1
dividing	1
the	1
water	1
before	1
them,	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
an	1
everlasting	1
name?	1
	1
63:13	1
That	1
led	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
deep,	1
as	1
an	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
stumble?	1
	1
63:14	1
As	1
a	1
beast	1
goeth	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
rest:	1
so	1
didst	1
thou	1
lead	1
thy	1
people,	1
to	1
make	1
thyself	1
a	1
glorious	1
name.	1
	1
63:15	1
Look	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
behold	1
from	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
thy	1
holiness	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
glory:	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
zeal	1
and	1
thy	1
strength,	1
the	1
sounding	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
mercies	1
toward	1
me?	1
are	1
they	1
restrained?	1
	1
63:16	1
Doubtless	1
thou	1
art	1
our	1
father,	1
though	1
Abraham	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
Israel	1
acknowledge	1
us	1
not:	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
art	1
our	1
father,	1
our	1
redeemer;	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
63:17	1
O	1
LORD,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
err	1
from	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
hardened	1
our	1
heart	1
from	1
thy	1
fear?	1
Return	1
for	1
thy	1
servants'	1
sake,	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
thine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
63:18	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
thy	1
holiness	1
have	1
possessed	1
it	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
while:	1
our	1
adversaries	1
have	1
trodden	1
down	1
thy	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
63:19	1
We	1
are	1
thine:	1
thou	1
never	1
barest	1
rule	1
over	1
them;	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
64:1	1
Oh	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
rend	1
the	1
heavens,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
come	1
down,	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
might	1
flow	1
down	1
at	1
thy	1
presence,	1
64:2	1
As	1
when	1
the	1
melting	1
fire	1
burneth,	1
the	1
fire	1
causeth	1
the	1
waters	1
to	1
boil,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
name	1
known	1
to	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
that	1
the	1
nations	1
may	1
tremble	1
at	1
thy	1
presence!	1
	1
64:3	1
When	1
thou	1
didst	1
terrible	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
looked	1
not	1
for,	1
thou	1
camest	1
down,	1
the	1
mountains	1
flowed	1
down	1
at	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
64:4	1
For	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
heard,	1
nor	1
perceived	1
by	1
the	1
ear,	1
neither	1
hath	1
the	1
eye	1
seen,	1
O	1
God,	1
beside	1
thee,	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
waiteth	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
64:5	1
Thou	1
meetest	1
him	1
that	1
rejoiceth	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
those	1
that	1
remember	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
ways:	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
wroth;	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned:	1
in	1
those	1
is	1
continuance,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
64:6	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
an	1
unclean	1
thing,	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
righteousnesses	1
are	1
as	1
filthy	1
rags;	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
do	1
fade	1
as	1
a	1
leaf;	1
and	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
like	1
the	1
wind,	1
have	1
taken	1
us	1
away.	1
	1
64:7	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
calleth	1
upon	1
thy	1
name,	1
that	1
stirreth	1
up	1
himself	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
thy	1
face	1
from	1
us,	1
and	1
hast	1
consumed	1
us,	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
iniquities.	1
	1
64:8	1
But	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
our	1
father;	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
thou	1
our	1
potter;	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
hand.	1
	1
64:9	1
Be	1
not	1
wroth	1
very	1
sore,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
remember	1
iniquity	1
for	1
ever:	1
behold,	1
see,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
64:10	1
Thy	1
holy	1
cities	1
are	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
Zion	1
is	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
desolation.	1
	1
64:11	1
Our	1
holy	1
and	1
our	1
beautiful	1
house,	1
where	1
our	1
fathers	1
praised	1
thee,	1
is	1
burned	1
up	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
pleasant	1
things	1
are	1
laid	1
waste.	1
	1
64:12	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
refrain	1
thyself	1
for	1
these	1
things,	1
O	1
LORD?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
afflict	1
us	1
very	1
sore?	1
	1
65:1	1
I	1
am	1
sought	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
for	1
me;	1
I	1
am	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not:	1
I	1
said,	1
Behold	1
me,	1
behold	1
me,	1
unto	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
65:2	1
I	1
have	1
spread	1
out	1
my	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
unto	1
a	1
rebellious	1
people,	1
which	1
walketh	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good,	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
thoughts;	1
65:3	1
A	1
people	1
that	1
provoketh	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
continually	1
to	1
my	1
face;	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
in	1
gardens,	1
and	1
burneth	1
incense	1
upon	1
altars	1
of	1
brick;	1
65:4	1
Which	1
remain	1
among	1
the	1
graves,	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
monuments,	1
which	1
eat	1
swine's	1
flesh,	1
and	1
broth	1
of	1
abominable	1
things	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
vessels;	1
65:5	1
Which	1
say,	1
Stand	1
by	1
thyself,	1
come	1
not	1
near	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holier	1
than	1
thou.	1
These	1
are	1
a	1
smoke	1
in	1
my	1
nose,	1
a	1
fire	1
that	1
burneth	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
65:6	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
before	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
silence,	1
but	1
will	1
recompense,	1
even	1
recompense	1
into	1
their	1
bosom,	1
65:7	1
Your	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
hills:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
measure	1
their	1
former	1
work	1
into	1
their	1
bosom.	1
	1
65:8	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
As	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
cluster,	1
and	1
one	1
saith,	1
Destroy	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
a	1
blessing	1
is	1
in	1
it:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
servants'	1
sakes,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
destroy	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
65:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
seed	1
out	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Judah	1
an	1
inheritor	1
of	1
my	1
mountains:	1
and	1
mine	1
elect	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it,	1
and	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
dwell	1
there.	1
	1
65:10	1
And	1
Sharon	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fold	1
of	1
flocks,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
herds	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in,	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
sought	1
me.	1
	1
65:11	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
forget	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
that	1
prepare	1
a	1
table	1
for	1
that	1
troop,	1
and	1
that	1
furnish	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
unto	1
that	1
number.	1
	1
65:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
number	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter:	1
because	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
answer;	1
when	1
I	1
spake,	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear;	1
but	1
did	1
evil	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
did	1
choose	1
that	1
wherein	1
I	1
delighted	1
not.	1
	1
65:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
eat,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hungry:	1
behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
drink,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
thirsty:	1
behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
65:14	1
Behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
sing	1
for	1
joy	1
of	1
heart,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
cry	1
for	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart,	1
and	1
shall	1
howl	1
for	1
vexation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
	1
65:15	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
leave	1
your	1
name	1
for	1
a	1
curse	1
unto	1
my	1
chosen:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shall	1
slay	1
thee,	1
and	1
call	1
his	1
servants	1
by	1
another	1
name:	1
65:16	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
blesseth	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
bless	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sweareth	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
truth;	1
because	1
the	1
former	1
troubles	1
are	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
65:17	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
create	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
former	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
remembered,	1
nor	1
come	1
into	1
mind.	1
	1
65:18	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
create:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
create	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
rejoicing,	1
and	1
her	1
people	1
a	1
joy.	1
	1
65:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
weeping	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
heard	1
in	1
her,	1
nor	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
crying.	1
	1
65:20	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
thence	1
an	1
infant	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
filled	1
his	1
days:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
die	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old;	1
but	1
the	1
sinner	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old	1
shall	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
65:21	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
houses,	1
and	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
65:22	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
build,	1
and	1
another	1
inhabit;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
plant,	1
and	1
another	1
eat:	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
mine	1
elect	1
shall	1
long	1
enjoy	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
65:23	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
labour	1
in	1
vain,	1
nor	1
bring	1
forth	1
for	1
trouble;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
offspring	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
65:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
before	1
they	1
call,	1
I	1
will	1
answer;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
yet	1
speaking,	1
I	1
will	1
hear.	1
	1
65:25	1
The	1
wolf	1
and	1
the	1
lamb	1
shall	1
feed	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
shall	1
eat	1
straw	1
like	1
the	1
bullock:	1
and	1
dust	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
serpent's	1
meat.	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
nor	1
destroy	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
ye	1
build	1
unto	1
me?	1
and	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
66:2	1
For	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
hath	1
mine	1
hand	1
made,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
have	1
been,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
will	1
I	1
look,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
poor	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
contrite	1
spirit,	1
and	1
trembleth	1
at	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
66:3	1
He	1
that	1
killeth	1
an	1
ox	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
slew	1
a	1
man;	1
he	1
that	1
sacrificeth	1
a	1
lamb,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
cut	1
off	1
a	1
dog's	1
neck;	1
he	1
that	1
offereth	1
an	1
oblation,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
offered	1
swine's	1
blood;	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
incense,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
blessed	1
an	1
idol.	1
	1
Yea,	1
they	1
have	1
chosen	1
their	1
own	1
ways,	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
delighteth	1
in	1
their	1
abominations.	1
	1
66:4	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
choose	1
their	1
delusions,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
their	1
fears	1
upon	1
them;	1
because	1
when	1
I	1
called,	1
none	1
did	1
answer;	1
when	1
I	1
spake,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
evil	1
before	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
chose	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
delighted	1
not.	1
	1
66:5	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
that	1
tremble	1
at	1
his	1
word;	1
Your	1
brethren	1
that	1
hated	1
you,	1
that	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
glorified:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
appear	1
to	1
your	1
joy,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
66:6	1
A	1
voice	1
of	1
noise	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
rendereth	1
recompence	1
to	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
66:7	1
Before	1
she	1
travailed,	1
she	1
brought	1
forth;	1
before	1
her	1
pain	1
came,	1
she	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
66:8	1
Who	1
hath	1
heard	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
who	1
hath	1
seen	1
such	1
things?	1
Shall	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
in	1
one	1
day?	1
or	1
shall	1
a	1
nation	1
be	1
born	1
at	1
once?	1
	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Zion	1
travailed,	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
66:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
not	1
cause	1
to	1
bring	1
forth?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
I	1
cause	1
to	1
bring	1
forth,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
womb?	1
saith	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
66:10	1
Rejoice	1
ye	1
with	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
be	1
glad	1
with	1
her,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
love	1
her:	1
rejoice	1
for	1
joy	1
with	1
her,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
mourn	1
for	1
her:	1
66:11	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
suck,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
her	1
consolations;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
milk	1
out,	1
and	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
glory.	1
	1
66:12	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
extend	1
peace	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
like	1
a	1
flowing	1
stream:	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
suck,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
borne	1
upon	1
her	1
sides,	1
and	1
be	1
dandled	1
upon	1
her	1
knees.	1
	1
66:13	1
As	1
one	1
whom	1
his	1
mother	1
comforteth,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
comfort	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
66:14	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
this,	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
bones	1
shall	1
flourish	1
like	1
an	1
herb:	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
toward	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
indignation	1
toward	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
66:15	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
chariots	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
to	1
render	1
his	1
anger	1
with	1
fury,	1
and	1
his	1
rebuke	1
with	1
flames	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
66:16	1
For	1
by	1
fire	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
sword	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
plead	1
with	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
many.	1
	1
66:17	1
They	1
that	1
sanctify	1
themselves,	1
and	1
purify	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
gardens	1
behind	1
one	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
eating	1
swine's	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
abomination,	1
and	1
the	1
mouse,	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
works	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts:	1
it	1
shall	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
nations	1
and	1
tongues;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
66:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
sign	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
those	1
that	1
escape	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
Tarshish,	1
Pul,	1
and	1
Lud,	1
that	1
draw	1
the	1
bow,	1
to	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
Javan,	1
to	1
the	1
isles	1
afar	1
off,	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
my	1
fame,	1
neither	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
glory;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
declare	1
my	1
glory	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
66:20	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
all	1
your	1
brethren	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
upon	1
horses,	1
and	1
in	1
chariots,	1
and	1
in	1
litters,	1
and	1
upon	1
mules,	1
and	1
upon	1
swift	1
beasts,	1
to	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain	1
Jerusalem,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
vessel	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
take	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
priests	1
and	1
for	1
Levites,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:22	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
earth,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
make,	1
shall	1
remain	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
so	1
shall	1
your	1
seed	1
and	1
your	1
name	1
remain.	1
	1
66:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
from	1
one	1
new	1
moon	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
sabbath	1
to	1
another,	1
shall	1
all	1
flesh	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
66:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
their	1
worm	1
shall	1
not	1
die,	1
neither	1
shall	1
their	1
fire	1
be	1
quenched;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abhorring	1
unto	1
all	1
flesh.	1

	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Anathoth	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
1:2	1
To	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
1:3	1
It	1
came	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
carrying	1
away	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
captive	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month.	1
	1
1:4	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
1:5	1
Before	1
I	1
formed	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
belly	1
I	1
knew	1
thee;	1
and	1
before	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb	1
I	1
sanctified	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
ordained	1
thee	1
a	1
prophet	1
unto	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
1:6	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
1:7	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Say	1
not,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
child:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
thee,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
faces:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
my	1
mouth.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:10	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
set	1
thee	1
over	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
root	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
pull	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
down,	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
to	1
plant.	1
	1
1:11	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Jeremiah,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
an	1
almond	1
tree.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
well	1
seen:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
hasten	1
my	1
word	1
to	1
perform	1
it.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
seething	1
pot;	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
thereof	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
1:14	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
an	1
evil	1
shall	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:15	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
set	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
throne	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
my	1
judgments	1
against	1
them	1
touching	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
who	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
1:17	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
gird	1
up	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
arise,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee:	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed	1
at	1
their	1
faces,	1
lest	1
I	1
confound	1
thee	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
1:18	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
a	1
defenced	1
city,	1
and	1
an	1
iron	1
pillar,	1
and	1
brasen	1
walls	1
against	1
the	1
whole	1
land,	1
against	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
against	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof,	1
against	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
against	1
thee;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
2:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Go	1
and	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
remember	1
thee,	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
thine	1
espousals,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
after	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
sown.	1
	1
2:3	1
Israel	1
was	1
holiness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
increase:	1
all	1
that	1
devour	1
him	1
shall	1
offend;	1
evil	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:4	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
2:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
iniquity	1
have	1
your	1
fathers	1
found	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
vanity,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
vain?	1
	1
2:6	1
Neither	1
said	1
they,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
led	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
deserts	1
and	1
of	1
pits,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
drought,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
through	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
passed	1
through,	1
and	1
where	1
no	1
man	1
dwelt?	1
2:7	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
plentiful	1
country,	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
goodness	1
thereof;	1
but	1
when	1
ye	1
entered,	1
ye	1
defiled	1
my	1
land,	1
and	1
made	1
mine	1
heritage	1
an	1
abomination.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
priests	1
said	1
not,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
law	1
knew	1
me	1
not:	1
the	1
pastors	1
also	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
by	1
Baal,	1
and	1
walked	1
after	1
things	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
profit.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
yet	1
plead	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
children's	1
children	1
will	1
I	1
plead.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
Chittim,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
send	1
unto	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
consider	1
diligently,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
	1
2:11	1
Hath	1
a	1
nation	1
changed	1
their	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
no	1
gods?	1
but	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
changed	1
their	1
glory	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
doth	1
not	1
profit.	1
	1
2:12	1
Be	1
astonished,	1
O	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
at	1
this,	1
and	1
be	1
horribly	1
afraid,	1
be	1
ye	1
very	1
desolate,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
committed	1
two	1
evils;	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
living	1
waters,	1
and	1
hewed	1
them	1
out	1
cisterns,	1
broken	1
cisterns,	1
that	1
can	1
hold	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
2:14	1
Is	1
Israel	1
a	1
servant?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
homeborn	1
slave?	1
why	1
is	1
he	1
spoiled?	1
2:15	1
The	1
young	1
lions	1
roared	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
yelled,	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
his	1
land	1
waste:	1
his	1
cities	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
2:16	1
Also	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Noph	1
and	1
Tahapanes	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thy	1
head.	1
	1
2:17	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
procured	1
this	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
when	1
he	1
led	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
now	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Sihor?	1
or	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river?	1
	1
2:19	1
Thine	1
own	1
wickedness	1
shall	1
correct	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
backslidings	1
shall	1
reprove	1
thee:	1
know	1
therefore	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
thing	1
and	1
bitter,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
fear	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
thy	1
yoke,	1
and	1
burst	1
thy	1
bands;	1
and	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
transgress;	1
when	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree	1
thou	1
wanderest,	1
playing	1
the	1
harlot.	1
	1
2:21	1
Yet	1
I	1
had	1
planted	1
thee	1
a	1
noble	1
vine,	1
wholly	1
a	1
right	1
seed:	1
how	1
then	1
art	1
thou	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
degenerate	1
plant	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
vine	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
2:22	1
For	1
though	1
thou	1
wash	1
thee	1
with	1
nitre,	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
much	1
soap,	1
yet	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
marked	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
2:23	1
How	1
canst	1
thou	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
polluted,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
gone	1
after	1
Baalim?	1
	1
see	1
thy	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
know	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done:	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
swift	1
dromedary	1
traversing	1
her	1
ways;	1
2:24	1
A	1
wild	1
ass	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
snuffeth	1
up	1
the	1
wind	1
at	1
her	1
pleasure;	1
in	1
her	1
occasion	1
who	1
can	1
turn	1
her	1
away?	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
her	1
will	1
not	1
weary	1
themselves;	1
in	1
her	1
month	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
her.	1
	1
2:25	1
Withhold	1
thy	1
foot	1
from	1
being	1
unshod,	1
and	1
thy	1
throat	1
from	1
thirst:	1
but	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
no;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
strangers,	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
2:26	1
As	1
the	1
thief	1
is	1
ashamed	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
found,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
ashamed;	1
they,	1
their	1
kings,	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
their	1
priests,	1
and	1
their	1
prophets.	1
	1
2:27	1
Saying	1
to	1
a	1
stock,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
father;	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
stone,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
forth:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
their	1
back	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
their	1
face:	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
trouble	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
2:28	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
thy	1
gods	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
thee?	1
let	1
them	1
arise,	1
if	1
they	1
can	1
save	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
trouble:	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
cities	1
are	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Judah.	1
	1
2:29	1
Wherefore	1
will	1
ye	1
plead	1
with	1
me?	1
ye	1
all	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:30	1
In	1
vain	1
have	1
I	1
smitten	1
your	1
children;	1
they	1
received	1
no	1
correction:	1
your	1
own	1
sword	1
hath	1
devoured	1
your	1
prophets,	1
like	1
a	1
destroying	1
lion.	1
	1
2:31	1
O	1
generation,	1
see	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
a	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
Israel?	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
darkness?	1
wherefore	1
say	1
my	1
people,	1
We	1
are	1
lords;	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
no	1
more	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
2:32	1
Can	1
a	1
maid	1
forget	1
her	1
ornaments,	1
or	1
a	1
bride	1
her	1
attire?	1
yet	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
forgotten	1
me	1
days	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
2:33	1
Why	1
trimmest	1
thou	1
thy	1
way	1
to	1
seek	1
love?	1
therefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
taught	1
the	1
wicked	1
ones	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
2:34	1
Also	1
in	1
thy	1
skirts	1
is	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
innocents:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
it	1
by	1
secret	1
search,	1
but	1
upon	1
all	1
these.	1
	1
2:35	1
Yet	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
innocent,	1
surely	1
his	1
anger	1
shall	1
turn	1
from	1
me.	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned.	1
	1
2:36	1
Why	1
gaddest	1
thou	1
about	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
change	1
thy	1
way?	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
wast	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
2:37	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
thine	1
hands	1
upon	1
thine	1
head:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
thy	1
confidences,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
prosper	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
They	1
say,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
go	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
become	1
another	1
man's,	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
unto	1
her	1
again?	1
shall	1
not	1
that	1
land	1
be	1
greatly	1
polluted?	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
with	1
many	1
lovers;	1
yet	1
return	1
again	1
to	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:2	1
Lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
see	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
lien	1
with.	1
In	1
the	1
ways	1
hast	1
thou	1
sat	1
for	1
them,	1
as	1
the	1
Arabian	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
polluted	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
wickedness.	1
	1
3:3	1
Therefore	1
the	1
showers	1
have	1
been	1
withholden,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
no	1
latter	1
rain;	1
and	1
thou	1
hadst	1
a	1
whore's	1
forehead,	1
thou	1
refusedst	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:4	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
father,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
guide	1
of	1
my	1
youth?	1
	1
3:5	1
Will	1
he	1
reserve	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever?	1
will	1
he	1
keep	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
end?	1
	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
and	1
done	1
evil	1
things	1
as	1
thou	1
couldest.	1
	1
3:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
king,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
that	1
which	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
hath	1
done?	1
she	1
is	1
gone	1
up	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
mountain	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
Turn	1
thou	1
unto	1
me.	1
But	1
she	1
returned	1
not.	1
And	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
saw	1
it.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
when	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
causes	1
whereby	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
committed	1
adultery	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
away,	1
and	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorce;	1
yet	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
feared	1
not,	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
also.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
her	1
whoredom,	1
that	1
she	1
defiled	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
with	1
stocks.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
her	1
treacherous	1
sister	1
Judah	1
hath	1
not	1
turned	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
whole	1
heart,	1
but	1
feignedly,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
backsliding	1
Israel	1
hath	1
justified	1
herself	1
more	1
than	1
treacherous	1
Judah.	1
	1
3:12	1
Go	1
and	1
proclaim	1
these	1
words	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
say,	1
Return,	1
thou	1
backsliding	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
cause	1
mine	1
anger	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
merciful,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
anger	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:13	1
Only	1
acknowledge	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
transgressed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
hast	1
scattered	1
thy	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:14	1
Turn,	1
O	1
backsliding	1
children,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
married	1
unto	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
a	1
family,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
Zion:	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
pastors	1
according	1
to	1
mine	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
feed	1
you	1
with	1
knowledge	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
multiplied	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
mind:	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
remember	1
it;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
visit	1
it;	1
neither	1
shall	1
that	1
be	1
done	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:17	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
it,	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
walk	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart.	1
	1
3:18	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
pleasant	1
land,	1
a	1
goodly	1
heritage	1
of	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
nations?	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
me,	1
My	1
father;	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
3:20	1
Surely	1
as	1
a	1
wife	1
treacherously	1
departeth	1
from	1
her	1
husband,	1
so	1
have	1
ye	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
me,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:21	1
A	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
weeping	1
and	1
supplications	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
perverted	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
Return,	1
ye	1
backsliding	1
children,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
your	1
backslidings.	1
	1
Behold,	1
we	1
come	1
unto	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
3:23	1
Truly	1
in	1
vain	1
is	1
salvation	1
hoped	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
mountains:	1
truly	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:24	1
For	1
shame	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
our	1
youth;	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters.	1
	1
3:25	1
We	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
our	1
shame,	1
and	1
our	1
confusion	1
covereth	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
from	1
our	1
youth	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
4:1	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
return,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
return	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
put	1
away	1
thine	1
abominations	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
remove.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
swear,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
in	1
truth,	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
bless	1
themselves	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
they	1
glory.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
Break	1
up	1
your	1
fallow	1
ground,	1
and	1
sow	1
not	1
among	1
thorns.	1
	1
4:4	1
Circumcise	1
yourselves	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
foreskins	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
lest	1
my	1
fury	1
come	1
forth	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
burn	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
quench	1
it,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings.	1
	1
4:5	1
Declare	1
ye	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
publish	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
say,	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
cry,	1
gather	1
together,	1
and	1
say,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities.	1
	1
4:6	1
Set	1
up	1
the	1
standard	1
toward	1
Zion:	1
retire,	1
stay	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
4:7	1
The	1
lion	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
thicket,	1
and	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
is	1
on	1
his	1
way;	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
land	1
desolate;	1
and	1
thy	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
this	1
gird	1
you	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
lament	1
and	1
howl:	1
for	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
princes;	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
wonder.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
surely	1
thou	1
hast	1
greatly	1
deceived	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
peace;	1
whereas	1
the	1
sword	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
4:11	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
A	1
dry	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
toward	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
not	1
to	1
fan,	1
nor	1
to	1
cleanse,	1
4:12	1
Even	1
a	1
full	1
wind	1
from	1
those	1
places	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
now	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
sentence	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
4:13	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
as	1
clouds,	1
and	1
his	1
chariots	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind:	1
his	1
horses	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
eagles.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
spoiled.	1
	1
4:14	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
wash	1
thine	1
heart	1
from	1
wickedness,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
saved.	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
thy	1
vain	1
thoughts	1
lodge	1
within	1
thee?	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
a	1
voice	1
declareth	1
from	1
Dan,	1
and	1
publisheth	1
affliction	1
from	1
mount	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
4:16	1
Make	1
ye	1
mention	1
to	1
the	1
nations;	1
behold,	1
publish	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
watchers	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
and	1
give	1
out	1
their	1
voice	1
against	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
4:17	1
As	1
keepers	1
of	1
a	1
field,	1
are	1
they	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about;	1
because	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
rebellious	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:18	1
Thy	1
way	1
and	1
thy	1
doings	1
have	1
procured	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
thee;	1
this	1
is	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
bitter,	1
because	1
it	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
bowels,	1
my	1
bowels!	1
I	1
am	1
pained	1
at	1
my	1
very	1
heart;	1
my	1
heart	1
maketh	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
me;	1
I	1
cannot	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
4:20	1
Destruction	1
upon	1
destruction	1
is	1
cried;	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
suddenly	1
are	1
my	1
tents	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
my	1
curtains	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
4:21	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
standard,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
foolish,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
me;	1
they	1
are	1
sottish	1
children,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
none	1
understanding:	1
they	1
are	1
wise	1
to	1
do	1
evil,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
knowledge.	1
	1
4:23	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
form,	1
and	1
void;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
light.	1
	1
4:24	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
they	1
trembled,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
moved	1
lightly.	1
	1
4:25	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
fled.	1
	1
4:26	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
fruitful	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
were	1
broken	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
The	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate;	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end.	1
	1
4:28	1
For	1
this	1
shall	1
the	1
earth	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
above	1
be	1
black;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
purposed	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
back	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
4:29	1
The	1
whole	1
city	1
shall	1
flee	1
for	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
and	1
bowmen;	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
thickets,	1
and	1
climb	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
rocks:	1
every	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
spoiled,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do?	1
Though	1
thou	1
clothest	1
thyself	1
with	1
crimson,	1
though	1
thou	1
deckest	1
thee	1
with	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold,	1
though	1
thou	1
rentest	1
thy	1
face	1
with	1
painting,	1
in	1
vain	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
thyself	1
fair;	1
thy	1
lovers	1
will	1
despise	1
thee,	1
they	1
will	1
seek	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
4:31	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail,	1
and	1
the	1
anguish	1
as	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
her	1
first	1
child,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
that	1
bewaileth	1
herself,	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
her	1
hands,	1
saying,	1
Woe	1
is	1
me	1
now!	1
for	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
wearied	1
because	1
of	1
murderers.	1
	1
5:1	1
Run	1
ye	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
see	1
now,	1
and	1
know,	1
and	1
seek	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
places	1
thereof,	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
find	1
a	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
that	1
executeth	1
judgment,	1
that	1
seeketh	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pardon	1
it.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
surely	1
they	1
swear	1
falsely.	1
	1
5:3	1
O	1
LORD,	1
are	1
not	1
thine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
truth?	1
thou	1
hast	1
stricken	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
grieved;	1
thou	1
hast	1
consumed	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
receive	1
correction:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
faces	1
harder	1
than	1
a	1
rock;	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
5:4	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
these	1
are	1
poor;	1
they	1
are	1
foolish:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
their	1
God:	1
but	1
these	1
have	1
altogether	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke,	1
and	1
burst	1
the	1
bonds.	1
	1
5:6	1
Wherefore	1
a	1
lion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
shall	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
wolf	1
of	1
the	1
evenings	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
a	1
leopard	1
shall	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
cities:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
goeth	1
out	1
thence	1
shall	1
be	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces:	1
because	1
their	1
transgressions	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
their	1
backslidings	1
are	1
increased.	1
	1
5:7	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
pardon	1
thee	1
for	1
this?	1
thy	1
children	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
sworn	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
gods:	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
they	1
then	1
committed	1
adultery,	1
and	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
by	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
harlots'	1
houses.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
were	1
as	1
fed	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
every	1
one	1
neighed	1
after	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
5:10	1
Go	1
ye	1
up	1
upon	1
her	1
walls,	1
and	1
destroy;	1
but	1
make	1
not	1
a	1
full	1
end:	1
take	1
away	1
her	1
battlements;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
5:11	1
For	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
dealt	1
very	1
treacherously	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:12	1
They	1
have	1
belied	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
he;	1
neither	1
shall	1
evil	1
come	1
upon	1
us;	1
neither	1
shall	1
we	1
see	1
sword	1
nor	1
famine:	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
become	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
them:	1
thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Because	1
ye	1
speak	1
this	1
word,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
fire,	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
wood,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
5:15	1
Lo,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
nation	1
upon	1
you	1
from	1
far,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
nation,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
ancient	1
nation,	1
a	1
nation	1
whose	1
language	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not,	1
neither	1
understandest	1
what	1
they	1
say.	1
	1
5:16	1
Their	1
quiver	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thine	1
harvest,	1
and	1
thy	1
bread,	1
which	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
should	1
eat:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thy	1
flocks	1
and	1
thine	1
herds:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
thy	1
vines	1
and	1
thy	1
fig	1
trees:	1
they	1
shall	1
impoverish	1
thy	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustedst,	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
5:18	1
Nevertheless	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
doeth	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
us?	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
answer	1
them,	1
Like	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
strange	1
gods	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
serve	1
strangers	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
your's.	1
	1
5:20	1
Declare	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
publish	1
it	1
in	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
5:21	1
Hear	1
now	1
this,	1
O	1
foolish	1
people,	1
and	1
without	1
understanding;	1
which	1
have	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see	1
not;	1
which	1
have	1
ears,	1
and	1
hear	1
not:	1
5:22	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
will	1
ye	1
not	1
tremble	1
at	1
my	1
presence,	1
which	1
have	1
placed	1
the	1
sand	1
for	1
the	1
bound	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
decree,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
pass	1
it:	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
toss	1
themselves,	1
yet	1
can	1
they	1
not	1
prevail;	1
though	1
they	1
roar,	1
yet	1
can	1
they	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
it?	1
	1
5:23	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
hath	1
a	1
revolting	1
and	1
a	1
rebellious	1
heart;	1
they	1
are	1
revolted	1
and	1
gone.	1
	1
5:24	1
Neither	1
say	1
they	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
rain,	1
both	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
in	1
his	1
season:	1
he	1
reserveth	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
appointed	1
weeks	1
of	1
the	1
harvest.	1
	1
5:25	1
Your	1
iniquities	1
have	1
turned	1
away	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
your	1
sins	1
have	1
withholden	1
good	1
things	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
found	1
wicked	1
men:	1
they	1
lay	1
wait,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
setteth	1
snares;	1
they	1
set	1
a	1
trap,	1
they	1
catch	1
men.	1
	1
5:27	1
As	1
a	1
cage	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
birds,	1
so	1
are	1
their	1
houses	1
full	1
of	1
deceit:	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
become	1
great,	1
and	1
waxen	1
rich.	1
	1
5:28	1
They	1
are	1
waxen	1
fat,	1
they	1
shine:	1
yea,	1
they	1
overpass	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
they	1
judge	1
not	1
the	1
cause,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
yet	1
they	1
prosper;	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
needy	1
do	1
they	1
not	1
judge.	1
	1
5:29	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
5:30	1
A	1
wonderful	1
and	1
horrible	1
thing	1
is	1
committed	1
in	1
the	1
land;	1
5:31	1
The	1
prophets	1
prophesy	1
falsely,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
bear	1
rule	1
by	1
their	1
means;	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
love	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so:	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
thereof?	1
	1
6:1	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Tekoa,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
Bethhaccerem:	1
for	1
evil	1
appeareth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
6:2	1
I	1
have	1
likened	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
to	1
a	1
comely	1
and	1
delicate	1
woman.	1
	1
6:3	1
The	1
shepherds	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
her;	1
they	1
shall	1
pitch	1
their	1
tents	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about;	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
6:4	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
war	1
against	1
her;	1
arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
at	1
noon.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
goeth	1
away,	1
for	1
the	1
shadows	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
are	1
stretched	1
out.	1
	1
6:5	1
Arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
destroy	1
her	1
palaces.	1
	1
6:6	1
For	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
said,	1
Hew	1
ye	1
down	1
trees,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
mount	1
against	1
Jerusalem:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
be	1
visited;	1
she	1
is	1
wholly	1
oppression	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
6:7	1
As	1
a	1
fountain	1
casteth	1
out	1
her	1
waters,	1
so	1
she	1
casteth	1
out	1
her	1
wickedness:	1
violence	1
and	1
spoil	1
is	1
heard	1
in	1
her;	1
before	1
me	1
continually	1
is	1
grief	1
and	1
wounds.	1
	1
6:8	1
Be	1
thou	1
instructed,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
lest	1
my	1
soul	1
depart	1
from	1
thee;	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
desolate,	1
a	1
land	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
6:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
They	1
shall	1
throughly	1
glean	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel	1
as	1
a	1
vine:	1
turn	1
back	1
thine	1
hand	1
as	1
a	1
grapegatherer	1
into	1
the	1
baskets.	1
	1
6:10	1
To	1
whom	1
shall	1
I	1
speak,	1
and	1
give	1
warning,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
hear?	1
behold,	1
their	1
ear	1
is	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
they	1
cannot	1
hearken:	1
behold,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
reproach;	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
6:11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
with	1
holding	1
in:	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
abroad,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
together:	1
for	1
even	1
the	1
husband	1
with	1
the	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
the	1
aged	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
days.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
others,	1
with	1
their	1
fields	1
and	1
wives	1
together:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them	1
every	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
prophet	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
every	1
one	1
dealeth	1
falsely.	1
	1
6:14	1
They	1
have	1
healed	1
also	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
slightly,	1
saying,	1
Peace,	1
peace;	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace.	1
	1
6:15	1
Were	1
they	1
ashamed	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
committed	1
abomination?	1
nay,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
blush:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
fall:	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
visit	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Stand	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
ways,	1
and	1
see,	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
paths,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
way,	1
and	1
walk	1
therein,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
walk	1
therein.	1
	1
6:17	1
Also	1
I	1
set	1
watchmen	1
over	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Hearken	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet.	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
hearken.	1
	1
6:18	1
Therefore	1
hear,	1
ye	1
nations,	1
and	1
know,	1
O	1
congregation,	1
what	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
6:19	1
Hear,	1
O	1
earth:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
people,	1
even	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1
words,	1
nor	1
to	1
my	1
law,	1
but	1
rejected	1
it.	1
	1
6:20	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
cometh	1
there	1
to	1
me	1
incense	1
from	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
the	1
sweet	1
cane	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country?	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
are	1
not	1
acceptable,	1
nor	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
sweet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
6:21	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
stumblingblocks	1
before	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
fathers	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
together	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
them;	1
the	1
neighbour	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
6:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
a	1
people	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
nation	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:23	1
They	1
shall	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
bow	1
and	1
spear;	1
they	1
are	1
cruel,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
mercy;	1
their	1
voice	1
roareth	1
like	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
they	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses,	1
set	1
in	1
array	1
as	1
men	1
for	1
war	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion.	1
	1
6:24	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
thereof:	1
our	1
hands	1
wax	1
feeble:	1
anguish	1
hath	1
taken	1
hold	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
pain,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
6:25	1
Go	1
not	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
nor	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fear	1
is	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
6:26	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
gird	1
thee	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
wallow	1
thyself	1
in	1
ashes:	1
make	1
thee	1
mourning,	1
as	1
for	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
most	1
bitter	1
lamentation:	1
for	1
the	1
spoiler	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
6:27	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
tower	1
and	1
a	1
fortress	1
among	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
and	1
try	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
6:28	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
grievous	1
revolters,	1
walking	1
with	1
slanders:	1
they	1
are	1
brass	1
and	1
iron;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
corrupters.	1
	1
6:29	1
The	1
bellows	1
are	1
burned,	1
the	1
lead	1
is	1
consumed	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
the	1
founder	1
melteth	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
not	1
plucked	1
away.	1
	1
6:30	1
Reprobate	1
silver	1
shall	1
men	1
call	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
them.	1
	1
7:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
7:2	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
there	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
these	1
gates	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:4	1
Trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
lying	1
words,	1
saying,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
are	1
these.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
throughly	1
amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings;	1
if	1
ye	1
throughly	1
execute	1
judgment	1
between	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
7:6	1
If	1
ye	1
oppress	1
not	1
the	1
stranger,	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
the	1
widow,	1
and	1
shed	1
not	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
neither	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
your	1
hurt:	1
7:7	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
your	1
fathers,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
7:8	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
trust	1
in	1
lying	1
words,	1
that	1
cannot	1
profit.	1
	1
7:9	1
Will	1
ye	1
steal,	1
murder,	1
and	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
and	1
swear	1
falsely,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
and	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not;	1
7:10	1
And	1
come	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
delivered	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
abominations?	1
	1
7:11	1
Is	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
become	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
robbers	1
in	1
your	1
eyes?	1
Behold,	1
even	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
go	1
ye	1
now	1
unto	1
my	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
where	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
name	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
now,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
works,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
speaking,	1
but	1
ye	1
heard	1
not;	1
and	1
I	1
called	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
answered	1
not;	1
7:14	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
trust,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
your	1
brethren,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
seed	1
of	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
7:16	1
Therefore	1
pray	1
not	1
thou	1
for	1
this	1
people,	1
neither	1
lift	1
up	1
cry	1
nor	1
prayer	1
for	1
them,	1
neither	1
make	1
intercession	1
to	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
7:17	1
Seest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
7:18	1
The	1
children	1
gather	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
fathers	1
kindle	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
knead	1
their	1
dough,	1
to	1
make	1
cakes	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
7:19	1
Do	1
they	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
do	1
they	1
not	1
provoke	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
faces?	1
	1
7:20	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
my	1
fury	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
burn,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
7:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Put	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
your	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
eat	1
flesh.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
spake	1
not	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
commanded	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
concerning	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
or	1
sacrifices:	1
7:23	1
But	1
this	1
thing	1
commanded	1
I	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:24	1
But	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
counsels	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart,	1
and	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
not	1
forward.	1
	1
7:25	1
Since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
your	1
fathers	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
daily	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them:	1
7:26	1
Yet	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
me,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
hardened	1
their	1
neck:	1
they	1
did	1
worse	1
than	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
7:27	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
call	1
unto	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
nor	1
receiveth	1
correction:	1
truth	1
is	1
perished,	1
and	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
7:29	1
Cut	1
off	1
thine	1
hair,	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
away,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
on	1
high	1
places;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
and	1
forsaken	1
the	1
generation	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
7:30	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
they	1
have	1
set	1
their	1
abominations	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
to	1
pollute	1
it.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
built	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Tophet,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
to	1
burn	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
came	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
7:32	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Tophet,	1
nor	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
but	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
slaughter:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
bury	1
in	1
Tophet,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
fray	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
7:34	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
8:1	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
graves:	1
8:2	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
spread	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
loved,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
served,	1
and	1
after	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
walked,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
sought,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
worshipped:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
gathered,	1
nor	1
be	1
buried;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
death	1
shall	1
be	1
chosen	1
rather	1
than	1
life	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
remain	1
of	1
this	1
evil	1
family,	1
which	1
remain	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:4	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Shall	1
they	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
arise?	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
away,	1
and	1
not	1
return?	1
	1
8:5	1
Why	1
then	1
is	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
slidden	1
back	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
backsliding?	1
they	1
hold	1
fast	1
deceit,	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
8:6	1
I	1
hearkened	1
and	1
heard,	1
but	1
they	1
spake	1
not	1
aright:	1
no	1
man	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
wickedness,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
every	1
one	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
course,	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
rusheth	1
into	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
8:7	1
Yea,	1
the	1
stork	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
knoweth	1
her	1
appointed	1
times;	1
and	1
the	1
turtle	1
and	1
the	1
crane	1
and	1
the	1
swallow	1
observe	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
coming;	1
but	1
my	1
people	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:8	1
How	1
do	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
wise,	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
us?	1
Lo,	1
certainly	1
in	1
vain	1
made	1
he	1
it;	1
the	1
pen	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
is	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
8:9	1
The	1
wise	1
men	1
are	1
ashamed,	1
they	1
are	1
dismayed	1
and	1
taken:	1
lo,	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
what	1
wisdom	1
is	1
in	1
them?	1
	1
8:10	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
their	1
wives	1
unto	1
others,	1
and	1
their	1
fields	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
shall	1
inherit	1
them:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
covetousness,	1
from	1
the	1
prophet	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
every	1
one	1
dealeth	1
falsely.	1
	1
8:11	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
healed	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
slightly,	1
saying,	1
Peace,	1
peace;	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace.	1
	1
8:12	1
Were	1
they	1
ashamed	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
committed	1
abomination?	1
nay,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
ashamed,	1
neither	1
could	1
they	1
blush:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
fall	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
fall:	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:13	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
consume	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
grapes	1
on	1
the	1
vine,	1
nor	1
figs	1
on	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
leaf	1
shall	1
fade;	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
8:14	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
sit	1
still?	1
assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
defenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
silent	1
there:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
us	1
to	1
silence,	1
and	1
given	1
us	1
water	1
of	1
gall	1
to	1
drink,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:15	1
We	1
looked	1
for	1
peace,	1
but	1
no	1
good	1
came;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
health,	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble!	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
snorting	1
of	1
his	1
horses	1
was	1
heard	1
from	1
Dan:	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
neighing	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
ones;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
come,	1
and	1
have	1
devoured	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
it;	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
8:17	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
serpents,	1
cockatrices,	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
charmed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bite	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:18	1
When	1
I	1
would	1
comfort	1
myself	1
against	1
sorrow,	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
faint	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Behold	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Zion?	1
is	1
not	1
her	1
king	1
in	1
her?	1
Why	1
have	1
they	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
graven	1
images,	1
and	1
with	1
strange	1
vanities?	1
	1
8:20	1
The	1
harvest	1
is	1
past,	1
the	1
summer	1
is	1
ended,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
saved.	1
	1
8:21	1
For	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
am	1
I	1
hurt;	1
I	1
am	1
black;	1
astonishment	1
hath	1
taken	1
hold	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
8:22	1
Is	1
there	1
no	1
balm	1
in	1
Gilead;	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
physician	1
there?	1
why	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
recovered?	1
	1
9:1	1
Oh	1
that	1
my	1
head	1
were	1
waters,	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
weep	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people!	1
	1
9:2	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
lodging	1
place	1
of	1
wayfaring	1
men;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
leave	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
go	1
from	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
all	1
adulterers,	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
treacherous	1
men.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
they	1
bend	1
their	1
tongues	1
like	1
their	1
bow	1
for	1
lies:	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
valiant	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
they	1
proceed	1
from	1
evil	1
to	1
evil,	1
and	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:4	1
Take	1
ye	1
heed	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
brother:	1
for	1
every	1
brother	1
will	1
utterly	1
supplant,	1
and	1
every	1
neighbour	1
will	1
walk	1
with	1
slanders.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
deceive	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
the	1
truth:	1
they	1
have	1
taught	1
their	1
tongue	1
to	1
speak	1
lies,	1
and	1
weary	1
themselves	1
to	1
commit	1
iniquity.	1
	1
9:6	1
Thine	1
habitation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
deceit;	1
through	1
deceit	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:7	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
melt	1
them,	1
and	1
try	1
them;	1
for	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people?	1
	1
9:8	1
Their	1
tongue	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
arrow	1
shot	1
out;	1
it	1
speaketh	1
deceit:	1
one	1
speaketh	1
peaceably	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour	1
with	1
his	1
mouth,	1
but	1
in	1
heart	1
he	1
layeth	1
his	1
wait.	1
	1
9:9	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
visit	1
them	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
shall	1
not	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
this?	1
	1
9:10	1
For	1
the	1
mountains	1
will	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
burned	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
pass	1
through	1
them;	1
neither	1
can	1
men	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cattle;	1
both	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
are	1
fled;	1
they	1
are	1
gone.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
heaps,	1
and	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
dragons;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
desolate,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
9:12	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
wise	1
man,	1
that	1
may	1
understand	1
this?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
declare	1
it,	1
for	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
perisheth	1
and	1
is	1
burned	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
none	1
passeth	1
through?	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
my	1
law	1
which	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
neither	1
walked	1
therein;	1
9:14	1
But	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
after	1
Baalim,	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
taught	1
them:	1
9:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them,	1
even	1
this	1
people,	1
with	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
water	1
of	1
gall	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
9:16	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
them	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
known:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
them,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Consider	1
ye,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
mourning	1
women,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come;	1
and	1
send	1
for	1
cunning	1
women,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come:	1
9:18	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
wailing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
may	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
our	1
eyelids	1
gush	1
out	1
with	1
waters.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
wailing	1
is	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
How	1
are	1
we	1
spoiled!	1
we	1
are	1
greatly	1
confounded,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
land,	1
because	1
our	1
dwellings	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
9:20	1
Yet	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
women,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
ear	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
teach	1
your	1
daughters	1
wailing,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
her	1
neighbour	1
lamentation.	1
	1
9:21	1
For	1
death	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
our	1
windows,	1
and	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
our	1
palaces,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
children	1
from	1
without,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
9:22	1
Speak,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Even	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
men	1
shall	1
fall	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
handful	1
after	1
the	1
harvestman,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
gather	1
them.	1
	1
9:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wise	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
might,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
riches:	1
9:24	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
glorieth	1
glory	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
he	1
understandeth	1
and	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
exercise	1
lovingkindness,	1
judgment,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
delight,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:25	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
uncircumcised;	1
9:26	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
corners,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
are	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
10:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
10:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Learn	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed	1
at	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
heaven;	1
for	1
the	1
heathen	1
are	1
dismayed	1
at	1
them.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
the	1
customs	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
vain:	1
for	1
one	1
cutteth	1
a	1
tree	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
workman,	1
with	1
the	1
axe.	1
	1
10:4	1
They	1
deck	1
it	1
with	1
silver	1
and	1
with	1
gold;	1
they	1
fasten	1
it	1
with	1
nails	1
and	1
with	1
hammers,	1
that	1
it	1
move	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
They	1
are	1
upright	1
as	1
the	1
palm	1
tree,	1
but	1
speak	1
not:	1
they	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
borne,	1
because	1
they	1
cannot	1
go.	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
do	1
evil,	1
neither	1
also	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
good.	1
	1
10:6	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
thou	1
art	1
great,	1
and	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
might.	1
	1
10:7	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
King	1
of	1
nations?	1
for	1
to	1
thee	1
doth	1
it	1
appertain:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
kingdoms,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
altogether	1
brutish	1
and	1
foolish:	1
the	1
stock	1
is	1
a	1
doctrine	1
of	1
vanities.	1
	1
10:9	1
Silver	1
spread	1
into	1
plates	1
is	1
brought	1
from	1
Tarshish,	1
and	1
gold	1
from	1
Uphaz,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
workman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
founder:	1
blue	1
and	1
purple	1
is	1
their	1
clothing:	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
cunning	1
men.	1
	1
10:10	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
everlasting	1
king:	1
at	1
his	1
wrath	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
tremble,	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
abide	1
his	1
indignation.	1
	1
10:11	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
gods	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
these	1
heavens.	1
	1
10:12	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
his	1
power,	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
hath	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
heavens	1
by	1
his	1
discretion.	1
	1
10:13	1
When	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
voice,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
he	1
causeth	1
the	1
vapours	1
to	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
maketh	1
lightnings	1
with	1
rain,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
the	1
wind	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasures.	1
	1
10:14	1
Every	1
man	1
is	1
brutish	1
in	1
his	1
knowledge:	1
every	1
founder	1
is	1
confounded	1
by	1
the	1
graven	1
image:	1
for	1
his	1
molten	1
image	1
is	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
10:15	1
They	1
are	1
vanity,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
errors:	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation	1
they	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
portion	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance:	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
10:17	1
Gather	1
up	1
thy	1
wares	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
fortress.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
sling	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
at	1
this	1
once,	1
and	1
will	1
distress	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
so.	1
	1
10:19	1
Woe	1
is	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
hurt!	1
my	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous;	1
but	1
I	1
said,	1
Truly	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
grief,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:20	1
My	1
tabernacle	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
cords	1
are	1
broken:	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
gone	1
forth	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
my	1
tent	1
any	1
more,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
curtains.	1
	1
10:21	1
For	1
the	1
pastors	1
are	1
become	1
brutish,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
flocks	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
10:22	1
Behold,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
bruit	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
commotion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
desolate,	1
and	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
dragons.	1
	1
10:23	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
himself:	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
man	1
that	1
walketh	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
10:24	1
O	1
LORD,	1
correct	1
me,	1
but	1
with	1
judgment;	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
anger,	1
lest	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
nothing.	1
	1
10:25	1
Pour	1
out	1
thy	1
fury	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
know	1
thee	1
not,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
families	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
on	1
thy	1
name:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
eaten	1
up	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
devoured	1
him,	1
and	1
consumed	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
habitation	1
desolate.	1
	1
11:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
saying,	1
11:2	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
11:3	1
And	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
obeyeth	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
11:4	1
Which	1
I	1
commanded	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
iron	1
furnace,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
do	1
them,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
you:	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
11:5	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
perform	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
Then	1
answered	1
I,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
be	1
it,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:6	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Proclaim	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
I	1
earnestly	1
protested	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
protesting,	1
saying,	1
Obey	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
11:8	1
Yet	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
walked	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
evil	1
heart:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
do:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
A	1
conspiracy	1
is	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
11:10	1
They	1
are	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
forefathers,	1
which	1
refused	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them:	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
broken	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
11:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
escape;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
go,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
gods	1
unto	1
whom	1
they	1
offer	1
incense:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
trouble.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
cities	1
were	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Judah;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
ye	1
set	1
up	1
altars	1
to	1
that	1
shameful	1
thing,	1
even	1
altars	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:14	1
Therefore	1
pray	1
not	1
thou	1
for	1
this	1
people,	1
neither	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
cry	1
or	1
prayer	1
for	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
their	1
trouble.	1
	1
11:15	1
What	1
hath	1
my	1
beloved	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
seeing	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
lewdness	1
with	1
many,	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
flesh	1
is	1
passed	1
from	1
thee?	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
evil,	1
then	1
thou	1
rejoicest.	1
	1
11:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
called	1
thy	1
name,	1
A	1
green	1
olive	1
tree,	1
fair,	1
and	1
of	1
goodly	1
fruit:	1
with	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
tumult	1
he	1
hath	1
kindled	1
fire	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
broken.	1
	1
11:17	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
planted	1
thee,	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
evil	1
against	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
against	1
themselves	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
in	1
offering	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it:	1
then	1
thou	1
shewedst	1
me	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
11:19	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
or	1
an	1
ox	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
devised	1
devices	1
against	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
destroy	1
the	1
tree	1
with	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
remembered.	1
	1
11:20	1
But,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
judgest	1
righteously,	1
that	1
triest	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
thy	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
revealed	1
my	1
cause.	1
	1
11:21	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
life,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
die	1
not	1
by	1
our	1
hand:	1
11:22	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them:	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
famine:	1
11:23	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
remnant	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
even	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
visitation.	1
	1
12:1	1
Righteous	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
plead	1
with	1
thee:	1
yet	1
let	1
me	1
talk	1
with	1
thee	1
of	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
prosper?	1
	1
wherefore	1
are	1
all	1
they	1
happy	1
that	1
deal	1
very	1
treacherously?	1
12:2	1
Thou	1
hast	1
planted	1
them,	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
root:	1
they	1
grow,	1
yea,	1
they	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit:	1
thou	1
art	1
near	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
reins.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
knowest	1
me:	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
and	1
tried	1
mine	1
heart	1
toward	1
thee:	1
pull	1
them	1
out	1
like	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
and	1
prepare	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
12:4	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
herbs	1
of	1
every	1
field	1
wither,	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein?	1
the	1
beasts	1
are	1
consumed,	1
and	1
the	1
birds;	1
because	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
our	1
last	1
end.	1
	1
12:5	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
run	1
with	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
wearied	1
thee,	1
then	1
how	1
canst	1
thou	1
contend	1
with	1
horses?	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
peace,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustedst,	1
they	1
wearied	1
thee,	1
then	1
how	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
swelling	1
of	1
Jordan?	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
even	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
even	1
they	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
called	1
a	1
multitude	1
after	1
thee:	1
believe	1
them	1
not,	1
though	1
they	1
speak	1
fair	1
words	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
12:7	1
I	1
have	1
forsaken	1
mine	1
house,	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
mine	1
heritage;	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
enemies.	1
	1
12:8	1
Mine	1
heritage	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
forest;	1
it	1
crieth	1
out	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hated	1
it.	1
	1
12:9	1
Mine	1
heritage	1
is	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
speckled	1
bird,	1
the	1
birds	1
round	1
about	1
are	1
against	1
her;	1
come	1
ye,	1
assemble	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
come	1
to	1
devour.	1
	1
12:10	1
Many	1
pastors	1
have	1
destroyed	1
my	1
vineyard,	1
they	1
have	1
trodden	1
my	1
portion	1
under	1
foot,	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
pleasant	1
portion	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness.	1
	1
12:11	1
They	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
desolate,	1
and	1
being	1
desolate	1
it	1
mourneth	1
unto	1
me;	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
is	1
made	1
desolate,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
layeth	1
it	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
12:12	1
The	1
spoilers	1
are	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
high	1
places	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
devour	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
no	1
flesh	1
shall	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
12:13	1
They	1
have	1
sown	1
wheat,	1
but	1
shall	1
reap	1
thorns:	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
themselves	1
to	1
pain,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
profit:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
your	1
revenues	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
all	1
mine	1
evil	1
neighbours,	1
that	1
touch	1
the	1
inheritance	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
inherit;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
plucked	1
them	1
out	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
heritage,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
diligently	1
learn	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
as	1
they	1
taught	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
Baal;	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
obey,	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
pluck	1
up	1
and	1
destroy	1
that	1
nation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
a	1
linen	1
girdle,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
water.	1
	1
13:2	1
So	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
girdle	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
loins.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
13:4	1
Take	1
the	1
girdle	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
got,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
hide	1
it	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
hole	1
of	1
the	1
rock.	1
	1
13:5	1
So	1
I	1
went,	1
and	1
hid	1
it	1
by	1
Euphrates,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
me.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
many	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
girdle	1
from	1
thence,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee	1
to	1
hide	1
there.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Euphrates,	1
and	1
digged,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
girdle	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
hid	1
it:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
girdle	1
was	1
marred,	1
it	1
was	1
profitable	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:8	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
13:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
will	1
I	1
mar	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
pride	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:10	1
This	1
evil	1
people,	1
which	1
refuse	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
which	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
walk	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
worship	1
them,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
as	1
this	1
girdle,	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
girdle	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
caused	1
to	1
cleave	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
praise,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
glory:	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
13:12	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
this	1
word;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Every	1
bottle	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
wine:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Do	1
we	1
not	1
certainly	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
bottle	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
wine?	1
	1
13:13	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land,	1
even	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
sit	1
upon	1
David's	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
with	1
drunkenness.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
dash	1
them	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
even	1
the	1
fathers	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
pity,	1
nor	1
spare,	1
nor	1
have	1
mercy,	1
but	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
13:15	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
and	1
give	1
ear;	1
be	1
not	1
proud:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
13:16	1
Give	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
before	1
he	1
cause	1
darkness,	1
and	1
before	1
your	1
feet	1
stumble	1
upon	1
the	1
dark	1
mountains,	1
and,	1
while	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
light,	1
he	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
gross	1
darkness.	1
	1
13:17	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
it,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
weep	1
in	1
secret	1
places	1
for	1
your	1
pride;	1
and	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
weep	1
sore,	1
and	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD's	1
flock	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
13:18	1
Say	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
queen,	1
Humble	1
yourselves,	1
sit	1
down:	1
for	1
your	1
principalities	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
even	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
13:19	1
The	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
shut	1
up,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
open	1
them:	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
all	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
13:20	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
north:	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
flock	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
thee,	1
thy	1
beautiful	1
flock?	1
	1
13:21	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
punish	1
thee?	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
captains,	1
and	1
as	1
chief	1
over	1
thee:	1
shall	1
not	1
sorrows	1
take	1
thee,	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail?	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
say	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
these	1
things	1
upon	1
me?	1
	1
For	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
are	1
thy	1
skirts	1
discovered,	1
and	1
thy	1
heels	1
made	1
bare.	1
	1
13:23	1
Can	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
change	1
his	1
skin,	1
or	1
the	1
leopard	1
his	1
spots?	1
then	1
may	1
ye	1
also	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
13:24	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
scatter	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
stubble	1
that	1
passeth	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:25	1
This	1
is	1
thy	1
lot,	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
thy	1
measures	1
from	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
and	1
trusted	1
in	1
falsehood.	1
	1
13:26	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
discover	1
thy	1
skirts	1
upon	1
thy	1
face,	1
that	1
thy	1
shame	1
may	1
appear.	1
	1
13:27	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thine	1
adulteries,	1
and	1
thy	1
neighings,	1
the	1
lewdness	1
of	1
thy	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
thine	1
abominations	1
on	1
the	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
fields.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem!	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
clean?	1
when	1
shall	1
it	1
once	1
be?	1
	1
14:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
concerning	1
the	1
dearth.	1
	1
14:2	1
Judah	1
mourneth,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
languish;	1
they	1
are	1
black	1
unto	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
gone	1
up.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
their	1
nobles	1
have	1
sent	1
their	1
little	1
ones	1
to	1
the	1
waters:	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pits,	1
and	1
found	1
no	1
water;	1
they	1
returned	1
with	1
their	1
vessels	1
empty;	1
they	1
were	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded,	1
and	1
covered	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
14:4	1
Because	1
the	1
ground	1
is	1
chapt,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
plowmen	1
were	1
ashamed,	1
they	1
covered	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
14:5	1
Yea,	1
the	1
hind	1
also	1
calved	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
forsook	1
it,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
grass.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
wild	1
asses	1
did	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
they	1
snuffed	1
up	1
the	1
wind	1
like	1
dragons;	1
their	1
eyes	1
did	1
fail,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
grass.	1
	1
14:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
though	1
our	1
iniquities	1
testify	1
against	1
us,	1
do	1
thou	1
it	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake:	1
for	1
our	1
backslidings	1
are	1
many;	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
14:8	1
O	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
saviour	1
thereof	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
that	1
turneth	1
aside	1
to	1
tarry	1
for	1
a	1
night?	1
	1
14:9	1
Why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
astonied,	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
that	1
cannot	1
save?	1
yet	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name;	1
leave	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
14:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
Thus	1
have	1
they	1
loved	1
to	1
wander,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
refrained	1
their	1
feet,	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
not	1
accept	1
them;	1
he	1
will	1
now	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
visit	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
14:11	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Pray	1
not	1
for	1
this	1
people	1
for	1
their	1
good.	1
	1
14:12	1
When	1
they	1
fast,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
their	1
cry;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
an	1
oblation,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
them:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah,	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
the	1
prophets	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
sword,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
famine;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
assured	1
peace	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
14:14	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
prophets	1
prophesy	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
commanded	1
them,	1
neither	1
spake	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
false	1
vision	1
and	1
divination,	1
and	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought,	1
and	1
the	1
deceit	1
of	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
14:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
yet	1
they	1
say,	1
Sword	1
and	1
famine	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
land;	1
By	1
sword	1
and	1
famine	1
shall	1
those	1
prophets	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
prophesy	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
famine	1
and	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
bury	1
them,	1
them,	1
their	1
wives,	1
nor	1
their	1
sons,	1
nor	1
their	1
daughters:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
their	1
wickedness	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
14:17	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
them;	1
Let	1
mine	1
eyes	1
run	1
down	1
with	1
tears	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
cease:	1
for	1
the	1
virgin	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
broken	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
breach,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
blow.	1
	1
14:18	1
If	1
I	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
then	1
behold	1
the	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword!	1
	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
then	1
behold	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sick	1
with	1
famine!	1
	1
yea,	1
both	1
the	1
prophet	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
go	1
about	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
14:19	1
Hast	1
thou	1
utterly	1
rejected	1
Judah?	1
hath	1
thy	1
soul	1
lothed	1
Zion?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
smitten	1
us,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
healing	1
for	1
us?	1
we	1
looked	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
healing,	1
and	1
behold	1
trouble!	1
	1
14:20	1
We	1
acknowledge,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
our	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
our	1
fathers:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
14:21	1
Do	1
not	1
abhor	1
us,	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake,	1
do	1
not	1
disgrace	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
thy	1
glory:	1
remember,	1
break	1
not	1
thy	1
covenant	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
14:22	1
Are	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
the	1
vanities	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
can	1
cause	1
rain?	1
or	1
can	1
the	1
heavens	1
give	1
showers?	1
art	1
not	1
thou	1
he,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
therefore	1
we	1
will	1
wait	1
upon	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Though	1
Moses	1
and	1
Samuel	1
stood	1
before	1
me,	1
yet	1
my	1
mind	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
toward	1
this	1
people:	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
forth.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Whither	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
forth?	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tell	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
death,	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
sword,	1
to	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
famine,	1
to	1
the	1
famine;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
captivity,	1
to	1
the	1
captivity.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
over	1
them	1
four	1
kinds,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
slay,	1
and	1
the	1
dogs	1
to	1
tear,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
devour	1
and	1
destroy.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
because	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:5	1
For	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
pity	1
upon	1
thee,	1
O	1
Jerusalem?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
bemoan	1
thee?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
go	1
aside	1
to	1
ask	1
how	1
thou	1
doest?	1
	1
15:6	1
Thou	1
hast	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
backward:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
destroy	1
thee;	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
with	1
repenting.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fan	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
I	1
will	1
bereave	1
them	1
of	1
children,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
my	1
people	1
since	1
they	1
return	1
not	1
from	1
their	1
ways.	1
	1
15:8	1
Their	1
widows	1
are	1
increased	1
to	1
me	1
above	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
seas:	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
a	1
spoiler	1
at	1
noonday:	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
it	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
terrors	1
upon	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
15:9	1
She	1
that	1
hath	1
borne	1
seven	1
languisheth:	1
she	1
hath	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
ghost;	1
her	1
sun	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
day:	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded:	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
to	1
the	1
sword	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:10	1
Woe	1
is	1
me,	1
my	1
mother,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
borne	1
me	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
strife	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
contention	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
earth!	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
lent	1
on	1
usury,	1
nor	1
men	1
have	1
lent	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
usury;	1
yet	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
doth	1
curse	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Verily	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
remnant;	1
verily	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
enemy	1
to	1
entreat	1
thee	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
evil	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
affliction.	1
	1
15:12	1
Shall	1
iron	1
break	1
the	1
northern	1
iron	1
and	1
the	1
steel?	1
	1
15:13	1
Thy	1
substance	1
and	1
thy	1
treasures	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
spoil	1
without	1
price,	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
sins,	1
even	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
pass	1
with	1
thine	1
enemies	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not:	1
for	1
a	1
fire	1
is	1
kindled	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
which	1
shall	1
burn	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest:	1
remember	1
me,	1
and	1
visit	1
me,	1
and	1
revenge	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
persecutors;	1
take	1
me	1
not	1
away	1
in	1
thy	1
longsuffering:	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
thy	1
sake	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
rebuke.	1
	1
15:16	1
Thy	1
words	1
were	1
found,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat	1
them;	1
and	1
thy	1
word	1
was	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
mine	1
heart:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
sat	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
mockers,	1
nor	1
rejoiced;	1
I	1
sat	1
alone	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
hand:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
indignation.	1
	1
15:18	1
Why	1
is	1
my	1
pain	1
perpetual,	1
and	1
my	1
wound	1
incurable,	1
which	1
refuseth	1
to	1
be	1
healed?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
altogether	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
as	1
waters	1
that	1
fail?	1
	1
15:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
If	1
thou	1
return,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
again,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
take	1
forth	1
the	1
precious	1
from	1
the	1
vile,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
my	1
mouth:	1
let	1
them	1
return	1
unto	1
thee;	1
but	1
return	1
not	1
thou	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
a	1
fenced	1
brasen	1
wall:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
against	1
thee,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
save	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
terrible.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
also	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
16:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
wife,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
sons	1
or	1
daughters	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
16:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
sons	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
daughters	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
concerning	1
their	1
mothers	1
that	1
bare	1
them,	1
and	1
concerning	1
their	1
fathers	1
that	1
begat	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
land;	1
16:4	1
They	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
grievous	1
deaths;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lamented;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
buried;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
famine;	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:5	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Enter	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
mourning,	1
neither	1
go	1
to	1
lament	1
nor	1
bemoan	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
peace	1
from	1
this	1
people,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
lovingkindness	1
and	1
mercies.	1
	1
16:6	1
Both	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
small	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
this	1
land:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
buried,	1
neither	1
shall	1
men	1
lament	1
for	1
them,	1
nor	1
cut	1
themselves,	1
nor	1
make	1
themselves	1
bald	1
for	1
them:	1
16:7	1
Neither	1
shall	1
men	1
tear	1
themselves	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
mourning,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
dead;	1
neither	1
shall	1
men	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
consolation	1
to	1
drink	1
for	1
their	1
father	1
or	1
for	1
their	1
mother.	1
	1
16:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
also	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
feasting,	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
this	1
people	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
pronounced	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
us?	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
iniquity?	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
sin	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God?	1
16:11	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
your	1
fathers	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
walked	1
after	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
have	1
served	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
law;	1
16:12	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
worse	1
than	1
your	1
fathers;	1
for,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
heart,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
16:13	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
ye	1
nor	1
your	1
fathers;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
serve	1
other	1
gods	1
day	1
and	1
night;	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
shew	1
you	1
favour.	1
	1
16:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
16:15	1
But,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
lands	1
whither	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
into	1
their	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
16:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
for	1
many	1
fishers,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fish	1
them;	1
and	1
after	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
for	1
many	1
hunters,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hunt	1
them	1
from	1
every	1
mountain,	1
and	1
from	1
every	1
hill,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holes	1
of	1
the	1
rocks.	1
	1
16:17	1
For	1
mine	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
ways:	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
my	1
face,	1
neither	1
is	1
their	1
iniquity	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
first	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
their	1
sin	1
double;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
defiled	1
my	1
land,	1
they	1
have	1
filled	1
mine	1
inheritance	1
with	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
their	1
detestable	1
and	1
abominable	1
things.	1
	1
16:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
my	1
fortress,	1
and	1
my	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
affliction,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
Surely	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
inherited	1
lies,	1
vanity,	1
and	1
things	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
profit.	1
	1
16:20	1
Shall	1
a	1
man	1
make	1
gods	1
unto	1
himself,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
gods?	1
	1
16:21	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
this	1
once	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
know,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
mine	1
hand	1
and	1
my	1
might;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:1	1
The	1
sin	1
of	1
Judah	1
is	1
written	1
with	1
a	1
pen	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
diamond:	1
it	1
is	1
graven	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
your	1
altars;	1
17:2	1
Whilst	1
their	1
children	1
remember	1
their	1
altars	1
and	1
their	1
groves	1
by	1
the	1
green	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
hills.	1
	1
17:3	1
O	1
my	1
mountain	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
substance	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
treasures	1
to	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
thy	1
high	1
places	1
for	1
sin,	1
throughout	1
all	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
thou,	1
even	1
thyself,	1
shalt	1
discontinue	1
from	1
thine	1
heritage	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
serve	1
thine	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
which	1
shall	1
burn	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
17:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
maketh	1
flesh	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
whose	1
heart	1
departeth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:6	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
heath	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
when	1
good	1
cometh;	1
but	1
shall	1
inhabit	1
the	1
parched	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
a	1
salt	1
land	1
and	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
17:7	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
trusteth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
whose	1
hope	1
the	1
LORD	1
is.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
tree	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
that	1
spreadeth	1
out	1
her	1
roots	1
by	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
when	1
heat	1
cometh,	1
but	1
her	1
leaf	1
shall	1
be	1
green;	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
careful	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
drought,	1
neither	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
yielding	1
fruit.	1
	1
17:9	1
The	1
heart	1
is	1
deceitful	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
desperately	1
wicked:	1
who	1
can	1
know	1
it?	1
	1
17:10	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
search	1
the	1
heart,	1
I	1
try	1
the	1
reins,	1
even	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
doings.	1
	1
17:11	1
As	1
the	1
partridge	1
sitteth	1
on	1
eggs,	1
and	1
hatcheth	1
them	1
not;	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
getteth	1
riches,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
right,	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fool.	1
	1
17:12	1
A	1
glorious	1
high	1
throne	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
our	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
17:13	1
O	1
LORD,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel,	1
all	1
that	1
forsake	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
depart	1
from	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
living	1
waters.	1
	1
17:14	1
Heal	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
healed;	1
save	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
praise.	1
	1
17:15	1
Behold,	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
now.	1
	1
17:16	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
hastened	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
pastor	1
to	1
follow	1
thee:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
desired	1
the	1
woeful	1
day;	1
thou	1
knowest:	1
that	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
lips	1
was	1
right	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
17:17	1
Be	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
unto	1
me:	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
17:18	1
Let	1
them	1
be	1
confounded	1
that	1
persecute	1
me,	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
me	1
be	1
confounded:	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
me	1
be	1
dismayed:	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
evil,	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
double	1
destruction.	1
	1
17:19	1
Thus	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me;	1
Go	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
whereby	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
17:20	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
all	1
Judah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
these	1
gates:	1
17:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
bear	1
no	1
burden	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
nor	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
17:22	1
Neither	1
carry	1
forth	1
a	1
burden	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
houses	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
any	1
work,	1
but	1
hallow	1
ye	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
17:23	1
But	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not,	1
neither	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear,	1
but	1
made	1
their	1
neck	1
stiff,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
hear,	1
nor	1
receive	1
instruction.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
diligently	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
no	1
burden	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
but	1
hallow	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
to	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
therein;	1
17:25	1
Then	1
shall	1
there	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
riding	1
in	1
chariots	1
and	1
on	1
horses,	1
they,	1
and	1
their	1
princes,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
remain	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
places	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
bringing	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
incense,	1
and	1
bringing	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
praise,	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:27	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
hallow	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
bear	1
a	1
burden,	1
even	1
entering	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
18:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
18:2	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
potter's	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
18:3	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
potter's	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
wrought	1
a	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
wheels.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
vessel	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
of	1
clay	1
was	1
marred	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
potter:	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
again	1
another	1
vessel,	1
as	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
potter	1
to	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
18:5	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
18:6	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
cannot	1
I	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
this	1
potter?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Behold,	1
as	1
the	1
clay	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
potter's	1
hand,	1
so	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:7	1
At	1
what	1
instant	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
concerning	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
concerning	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
pluck	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
pull	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it;	1
18:8	1
If	1
that	1
nation,	1
against	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced,	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
evil,	1
I	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
at	1
what	1
instant	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
concerning	1
a	1
nation,	1
and	1
concerning	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
build	1
and	1
to	1
plant	1
it;	1
18:10	1
If	1
it	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
it	1
obey	1
not	1
my	1
voice,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
repent	1
of	1
the	1
good,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
benefit	1
them.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go	1
to,	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
frame	1
evil	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
devise	1
a	1
device	1
against	1
you:	1
return	1
ye	1
now	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
make	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings	1
good.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
hope:	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
after	1
our	1
own	1
devices,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
every	1
one	1
do	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
heart.	1
	1
18:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Ask	1
ye	1
now	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
who	1
hath	1
heard	1
such	1
things:	1
the	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
done	1
a	1
very	1
horrible	1
thing.	1
	1
18:14	1
Will	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
which	1
cometh	1
from	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
the	1
field?	1
or	1
shall	1
the	1
cold	1
flowing	1
waters	1
that	1
come	1
from	1
another	1
place	1
be	1
forsaken?	1
	1
18:15	1
Because	1
my	1
people	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
vanity,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
stumble	1
in	1
their	1
ways	1
from	1
the	1
ancient	1
paths,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
paths,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
not	1
cast	1
up;	1
18:16	1
To	1
make	1
their	1
land	1
desolate,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
hissing;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
thereby	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
wag	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
18:17	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
them	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
before	1
the	1
enemy;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
face,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity.	1
	1
18:18	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
Come	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
devise	1
devices	1
against	1
Jeremiah;	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
not	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
priest,	1
nor	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
wise,	1
nor	1
the	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
prophet.	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
smite	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
tongue,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
18:19	1
Give	1
heed	1
to	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
contend	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
18:20	1
Shall	1
evil	1
be	1
recompensed	1
for	1
good?	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
a	1
pit	1
for	1
my	1
soul.	1
Remember	1
that	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
good	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
wrath	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
18:21	1
Therefore	1
deliver	1
up	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
their	1
blood	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
bereaved	1
of	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
be	1
widows;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
men	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
let	1
their	1
young	1
men	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
18:22	1
Let	1
a	1
cry	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
their	1
houses,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
a	1
troop	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
digged	1
a	1
pit	1
to	1
take	1
me,	1
and	1
hid	1
snares	1
for	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
18:23	1
Yet,	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
their	1
counsel	1
against	1
me	1
to	1
slay	1
me:	1
forgive	1
not	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
neither	1
blot	1
out	1
their	1
sin	1
from	1
thy	1
sight,	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
overthrown	1
before	1
thee;	1
deal	1
thus	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thine	1
anger.	1
	1
19:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
a	1
potter's	1
earthen	1
bottle,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
priests;	1
19:2	1
And	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
gate,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
there	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee,	1
19:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
the	1
which	1
whosoever	1
heareth,	1
his	1
ears	1
shall	1
tingle.	1
	1
19:4	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
estranged	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
in	1
it	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
whom	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
known,	1
nor	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
have	1
filled	1
this	1
place	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
innocents;	1
19:5	1
They	1
have	1
built	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Baal,	1
to	1
burn	1
their	1
sons	1
with	1
fire	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
not,	1
nor	1
spake	1
it,	1
neither	1
came	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
mind:	1
19:6	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Tophet,	1
nor	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
but	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
lives:	1
and	1
their	1
carcases	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
desolate,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
thereby	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
and	1
hiss	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plagues	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
and	1
straitness,	1
wherewith	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
lives,	1
shall	1
straiten	1
them.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
break	1
the	1
bottle	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
19:11	1
And	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
this	1
people	1
and	1
this	1
city,	1
as	1
one	1
breaketh	1
a	1
potter's	1
vessel,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
whole	1
again:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bury	1
them	1
in	1
Tophet,	1
till	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
place	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:12	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
place,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
and	1
even	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
as	1
Tophet:	1
19:13	1
And	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
shall	1
be	1
defiled	1
as	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Tophet,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
upon	1
whose	1
roofs	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
19:14	1
Then	1
came	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
Tophet,	1
whither	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
prophesy;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house;	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
19:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
this	1
city	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
her	1
towns	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
it,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
hardened	1
their	1
necks,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
hear	1
my	1
words.	1
	1
20:1	1
Now	1
Pashur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Immer	1
the	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chief	1
governor	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
heard	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
prophesied	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
Pashur	1
smote	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
stocks	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
gate	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Pashur	1
brought	1
forth	1
Jeremiah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stocks.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
thy	1
name	1
Pashur,	1
but	1
Magormissabib.	1
	1
20:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
friends:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
it:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
all	1
Judah	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
carry	1
them	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
shall	1
slay	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:5	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
labours	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
which	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
and	1
take	1
them,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
thou,	1
Pashur,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
buried	1
there,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
friends,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
prophesied	1
lies.	1
	1
20:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
deceived;	1
thou	1
art	1
stronger	1
than	1
I,	1
and	1
hast	1
prevailed:	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
derision	1
daily,	1
every	1
one	1
mocketh	1
me.	1
	1
20:8	1
For	1
since	1
I	1
spake,	1
I	1
cried	1
out,	1
I	1
cried	1
violence	1
and	1
spoil;	1
because	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
a	1
derision,	1
daily.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
him,	1
nor	1
speak	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
name.	1
But	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
as	1
a	1
burning	1
fire	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
weary	1
with	1
forbearing,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stay.	1
	1
20:10	1
For	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
defaming	1
of	1
many,	1
fear	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
Report,	1
say	1
they,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
report	1
it.	1
All	1
my	1
familiars	1
watched	1
for	1
my	1
halting,	1
saying,	1
Peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
enticed,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
our	1
revenge	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
terrible	1
one:	1
therefore	1
my	1
persecutors	1
shall	1
stumble,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
greatly	1
ashamed;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
their	1
everlasting	1
confusion	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
20:12	1
But,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
triest	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
seest	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
the	1
heart,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
thy	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
cause.	1
	1
20:13	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
evildoers.	1
	1
20:14	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
wherein	1
I	1
was	1
born:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
wherein	1
my	1
mother	1
bare	1
me	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
20:15	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
brought	1
tidings	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
saying,	1
A	1
man	1
child	1
is	1
born	1
unto	1
thee;	1
making	1
him	1
very	1
glad.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
let	1
that	1
man	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
overthrew,	1
and	1
repented	1
not:	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
the	1
cry	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
at	1
noontide;	1
20:17	1
Because	1
he	1
slew	1
me	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
womb;	1
or	1
that	1
my	1
mother	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
grave,	1
and	1
her	1
womb	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
great	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:18	1
Wherefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
see	1
labour	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
that	1
my	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
consumed	1
with	1
shame?	1
	1
21:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
king	1
Zedekiah	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
Pashur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Melchiah,	1
and	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
21:2	1
Enquire,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
us;	1
for	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
maketh	1
war	1
against	1
us;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
deal	1
with	1
us	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
wondrous	1
works,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
21:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
Zedekiah:	1
21:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
back	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
hands,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
which	1
besiege	1
you	1
without	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
assemble	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
you	1
with	1
an	1
outstretched	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
arm,	1
even	1
in	1
anger,	1
and	1
in	1
fury,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
wrath.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
pestilence.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
afterward,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
from	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
famine,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
spare	1
them,	1
neither	1
have	1
pity,	1
nor	1
have	1
mercy.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
out,	1
and	1
falleth	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
that	1
besiege	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
21:10	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
touching	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
say,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
21:12	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Execute	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
deliver	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
spoiled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
lest	1
my	1
fury	1
go	1
out	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
burn	1
that	1
none	1
can	1
quench	1
it,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings.	1
	1
21:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
which	1
say,	1
Who	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
us?	1
or	1
who	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
our	1
habitations?	1
	1
21:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
thereof,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
things	1
round	1
about	1
it.	1
	1
22:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
speak	1
there	1
this	1
word,	1
22:2	1
And	1
say,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
sittest	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
these	1
gates:	1
22:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Execute	1
ye	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
spoiled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor:	1
and	1
do	1
no	1
wrong,	1
do	1
no	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
stranger,	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
nor	1
the	1
widow,	1
neither	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
22:4	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
indeed,	1
then	1
shall	1
there	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
kings	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
riding	1
in	1
chariots	1
and	1
on	1
horses,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
these	1
words,	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
myself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
this	1
house	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
desolation.	1
	1
22:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
of	1
Judah;	1
Thou	1
art	1
Gilead	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Lebanon:	1
yet	1
surely	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
inhabited.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
destroyers	1
against	1
thee,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
weapons:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
thy	1
choice	1
cedars,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
pass	1
by	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
thus	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city?	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
they	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
	1
22:10	1
Weep	1
ye	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
neither	1
bemoan	1
him:	1
but	1
weep	1
sore	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
goeth	1
away:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
no	1
more,	1
nor	1
see	1
his	1
native	1
country.	1
	1
22:11	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
touching	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
reigned	1
instead	1
of	1
Josiah	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place;	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
thither	1
any	1
more:	1
22:12	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
they	1
have	1
led	1
him	1
captive,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
this	1
land	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
22:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
buildeth	1
his	1
house	1
by	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
his	1
chambers	1
by	1
wrong;	1
that	1
useth	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
service	1
without	1
wages,	1
and	1
giveth	1
him	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
work;	1
22:14	1
That	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
me	1
a	1
wide	1
house	1
and	1
large	1
chambers,	1
and	1
cutteth	1
him	1
out	1
windows;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
cieled	1
with	1
cedar,	1
and	1
painted	1
with	1
vermilion.	1
	1
22:15	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
reign,	1
because	1
thou	1
closest	1
thyself	1
in	1
cedar?	1
did	1
not	1
thy	1
father	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
do	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
22:16	1
He	1
judged	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy;	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
him:	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
know	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:17	1
But	1
thine	1
eyes	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
are	1
not	1
but	1
for	1
thy	1
covetousness,	1
and	1
for	1
to	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
oppression,	1
and	1
for	1
violence,	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
22:18	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
lament	1
for	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ah	1
my	1
brother!	1
or,	1
Ah	1
sister!	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
lament	1
for	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ah	1
lord!	1
or,	1
Ah	1
his	1
glory!	1
	1
22:19	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
buried	1
with	1
the	1
burial	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
drawn	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
beyond	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
22:20	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
cry;	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
voice	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
passages:	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
lovers	1
are	1
destroyed.	1
	1
22:21	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
prosperity;	1
but	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear.	1
This	1
hath	1
been	1
thy	1
manner	1
from	1
thy	1
youth,	1
that	1
thou	1
obeyedst	1
not	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
22:22	1
The	1
wind	1
shall	1
eat	1
up	1
all	1
thy	1
pastors,	1
and	1
thy	1
lovers	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
surely	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
wickedness.	1
	1
22:23	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
nest	1
in	1
the	1
cedars,	1
how	1
gracious	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
when	1
pangs	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
the	1
pain	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail!	1
	1
22:24	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
though	1
Coniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
the	1
signet	1
upon	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
pluck	1
thee	1
thence;	1
22:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
whose	1
face	1
thou	1
fearest,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
that	1
bare	1
thee,	1
into	1
another	1
country,	1
where	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
born;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
22:27	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
whereunto	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
return,	1
thither	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
return.	1
	1
22:28	1
Is	1
this	1
man	1
Coniah	1
a	1
despised	1
broken	1
idol?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure?	1
wherefore	1
are	1
they	1
cast	1
out,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
seed,	1
and	1
are	1
cast	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not?	1
	1
22:29	1
O	1
earth,	1
earth,	1
earth,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:30	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Write	1
ye	1
this	1
man	1
childless,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
days:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
sitting	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
ruling	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
Judah.	1
	1
23:1	1
Woe	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
pastors	1
that	1
destroy	1
and	1
scatter	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
my	1
pasture!	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:2	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
against	1
the	1
pastors	1
that	1
feed	1
my	1
people;	1
Ye	1
have	1
scattered	1
my	1
flock,	1
and	1
driven	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
visited	1
them:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
flock	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
countries	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
folds;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
fruitful	1
and	1
increase.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
shepherds	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
shall	1
feed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fear	1
no	1
more,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
lacking,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:5	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
unto	1
David	1
a	1
righteous	1
Branch,	1
and	1
a	1
King	1
shall	1
reign	1
and	1
prosper,	1
and	1
shall	1
execute	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
23:6	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
whereby	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called,	1
THE	1
LORD	1
OUR	1
RIGHTEOUSNESS.	1
	1
23:7	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
23:8	1
But,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
brought	1
up	1
and	1
which	1
led	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
countries	1
whither	1
I	1
had	1
driven	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
23:9	1
Mine	1
heart	1
within	1
me	1
is	1
broken	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
all	1
my	1
bones	1
shake;	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
drunken	1
man,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
wine	1
hath	1
overcome,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
23:10	1
For	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
adulterers;	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
swearing	1
the	1
land	1
mourneth;	1
the	1
pleasant	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
their	1
course	1
is	1
evil,	1
and	1
their	1
force	1
is	1
not	1
right.	1
	1
23:11	1
For	1
both	1
prophet	1
and	1
priest	1
are	1
profane;	1
yea,	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
have	1
I	1
found	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:12	1
Wherefore	1
their	1
way	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
slippery	1
ways	1
in	1
the	1
darkness:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
on,	1
and	1
fall	1
therein:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
them,	1
even	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
visitation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
folly	1
in	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
they	1
prophesied	1
in	1
Baal,	1
and	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
err.	1
	1
23:14	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
an	1
horrible	1
thing:	1
they	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
lies:	1
they	1
strengthen	1
also	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
that	1
none	1
doth	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
as	1
Gomorrah.	1
	1
23:15	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
with	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
drink	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
gall:	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
profaneness	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you:	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
vain:	1
they	1
speak	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:17	1
They	1
say	1
still	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
despise	1
me,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
peace;	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
walketh	1
after	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
No	1
evil	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
23:18	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hath	1
perceived	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
word?	1
who	1
hath	1
marked	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
heard	1
it?	1
23:19	1
Behold,	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
gone	1
forth	1
in	1
fury,	1
even	1
a	1
grievous	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
grievously	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
23:20	1
The	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
executed,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
heart:	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
consider	1
it	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
these	1
prophets,	1
yet	1
they	1
ran:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
prophesied.	1
	1
23:22	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
stood	1
in	1
my	1
counsel,	1
and	1
had	1
caused	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
then	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
turned	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
23:23	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
God	1
at	1
hand,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
afar	1
off?	1
23:24	1
Can	1
any	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
secret	1
places	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
him?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Do	1
not	1
I	1
fill	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:25	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
prophets	1
said,	1
that	1
prophesy	1
lies	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed.	1
	1
23:26	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
this	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
lies?	1
yea,	1
they	1
are	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
deceit	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart;	1
23:27	1
Which	1
think	1
to	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
forget	1
my	1
name	1
by	1
their	1
dreams	1
which	1
they	1
tell	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
as	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
forgotten	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
Baal.	1
	1
23:28	1
The	1
prophet	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
dream,	1
let	1
him	1
tell	1
a	1
dream;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
word,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
my	1
word	1
faithfully.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
chaff	1
to	1
the	1
wheat?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:29	1
Is	1
not	1
my	1
word	1
like	1
as	1
a	1
fire?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
hammer	1
that	1
breaketh	1
the	1
rock	1
in	1
pieces?	1
	1
23:30	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
steal	1
my	1
words	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
23:31	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
use	1
their	1
tongues,	1
and	1
say,	1
He	1
saith.	1
	1
23:32	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy	1
false	1
dreams,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
tell	1
them,	1
and	1
cause	1
my	1
people	1
to	1
err	1
by	1
their	1
lies,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
lightness;	1
yet	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
not,	1
nor	1
commanded	1
them:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profit	1
this	1
people	1
at	1
all,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
people,	1
or	1
the	1
prophet,	1
or	1
a	1
priest,	1
shall	1
ask	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
then	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
burden?	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
forsake	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
punish	1
that	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
23:35	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered?	1
and,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken?	1
	1
23:36	1
And	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
ye	1
mention	1
no	1
more:	1
for	1
every	1
man's	1
word	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
burden;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
perverted	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
23:37	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
prophet,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
thee?	1
and,	1
What	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken?	1
	1
23:38	1
But	1
since	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
say	1
this	1
word,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
say,	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
23:39	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
utterly	1
forget	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
forsake	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
cast	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
presence:	1
23:40	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
an	1
everlasting	1
reproach	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
shame,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
24:1	1
The	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
me,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
two	1
baskets	1
of	1
figs	1
were	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
that	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
the	1
carpenters	1
and	1
smiths,	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
24:2	1
One	1
basket	1
had	1
very	1
good	1
figs,	1
even	1
like	1
the	1
figs	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
ripe:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
basket	1
had	1
very	1
naughty	1
figs,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
bad.	1
	1
24:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou,	1
Jeremiah?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Figs;	1
the	1
good	1
figs,	1
very	1
good;	1
and	1
the	1
evil,	1
very	1
evil,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil.	1
	1
24:4	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Like	1
these	1
good	1
figs,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
for	1
their	1
good.	1
	1
24:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
good,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
this	1
land:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
pull	1
them	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them,	1
and	1
not	1
pluck	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
heart	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
heart.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
evil	1
figs,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil;	1
surely	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
24:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
their	1
hurt,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
reproach	1
and	1
a	1
proverb,	1
a	1
taunt	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
shall	1
drive	1
them.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
sword,	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
among	1
them,	1
till	1
they	1
be	1
consumed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
25:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
25:2	1
The	1
which	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
25:3	1
From	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
speaking;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
your	1
ear	1
to	1
hear.	1
	1
25:5	1
They	1
said,	1
Turn	1
ye	1
again	1
now	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
25:6	1
And	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
worship	1
them,	1
and	1
provoke	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
your	1
hands;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
no	1
hurt.	1
	1
25:7	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
your	1
hands	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
hurt.	1
	1
25:8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
my	1
words,	1
25:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
and	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
my	1
servant,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
these	1
nations	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
perpetual	1
desolations.	1
	1
25:10	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mirth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
millstones,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candle.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
this	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
these	1
nations	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
seventy	1
years.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
seventy	1
years	1
are	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
that	1
nation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
perpetual	1
desolations.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
that	1
land	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
it,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book,	1
which	1
Jeremiah	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
25:14	1
For	1
many	1
nations	1
and	1
great	1
kings	1
shall	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
them	1
also:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
deeds,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
25:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
me;	1
Take	1
the	1
wine	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
fury	1
at	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
cause	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
to	1
drink	1
it.	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
be	1
moved,	1
and	1
be	1
mad,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
25:17	1
Then	1
took	1
I	1
the	1
cup	1
at	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
drink,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
sent	1
me:	1
25:18	1
To	1
wit,	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
desolation,	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
a	1
curse;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day;	1
25:19	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people;	1
25:20	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
mingled	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Uz,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
Azzah,	1
and	1
Ekron,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
25:21	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
25:22	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea,	1
25:23	1
Dedan,	1
and	1
Tema,	1
and	1
Buz,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
corners,	1
25:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
mingled	1
people	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
25:25	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zimri,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
25:26	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
far	1
and	1
near,	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sheshach	1
shall	1
drink	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
25:27	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Drink	1
ye,	1
and	1
be	1
drunken,	1
and	1
spue,	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
rise	1
no	1
more,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
25:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
they	1
refuse	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
cup	1
at	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
drink,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Ye	1
shall	1
certainly	1
drink.	1
	1
25:29	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
bring	1
evil	1
on	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
should	1
ye	1
be	1
utterly	1
unpunished?	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unpunished:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
25:30	1
Therefore	1
prophesy	1
thou	1
against	1
them	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
roar	1
from	1
on	1
high,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation;	1
he	1
shall	1
mightily	1
roar	1
upon	1
his	1
habitation;	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
shout,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
tread	1
the	1
grapes,	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
25:31	1
A	1
noise	1
shall	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
the	1
nations,	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
all	1
flesh;	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
wicked	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:32	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Behold,	1
evil	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
nation	1
to	1
nation,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
whirlwind	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lamented,	1
neither	1
gathered,	1
nor	1
buried;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
25:34	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
cry;	1
and	1
wallow	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
ashes,	1
ye	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
for	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
slaughter	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
dispersions	1
are	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
like	1
a	1
pleasant	1
vessel.	1
	1
25:35	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
flee,	1
nor	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
to	1
escape.	1
	1
25:36	1
A	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
an	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
their	1
pasture.	1
	1
25:37	1
And	1
the	1
peaceable	1
habitations	1
are	1
cut	1
down	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:38	1
He	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
his	1
covert,	1
as	1
the	1
lion:	1
for	1
their	1
land	1
is	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
the	1
oppressor,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
26:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
this	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
26:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them;	1
diminish	1
not	1
a	1
word:	1
26:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
hearken,	1
and	1
turn	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
repent	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
which	1
I	1
purpose	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
26:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
26:5	1
To	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you,	1
both	1
rising	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
sending	1
them,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened;	1
26:6	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
this	1
house	1
like	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
this	1
city	1
a	1
curse	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
26:7	1
So	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
Jeremiah	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:8	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jeremiah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
26:9	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
This	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant?	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
against	1
Jeremiah	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:10	1
When	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
then	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house.	1
	1
26:11	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
die;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
against	1
this	1
city,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
26:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
prophesy	1
against	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard.	1
	1
26:13	1
Therefore	1
now	1
amend	1
your	1
ways	1
and	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
repent	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
26:14	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
your	1
hand:	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
seemeth	1
good	1
and	1
meet	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
26:15	1
But	1
know	1
ye	1
for	1
certain,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
put	1
me	1
to	1
death,	1
ye	1
shall	1
surely	1
bring	1
innocent	1
blood	1
upon	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof:	1
for	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
speak	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
26:16	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets;	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
26:17	1
Then	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
26:18	1
Micah	1
the	1
Morasthite	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
plowed	1
like	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
a	1
forest.	1
	1
26:19	1
Did	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
put	1
him	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
death?	1
	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
pronounced	1
against	1
them?	1
Thus	1
might	1
we	1
procure	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
our	1
souls.	1
	1
26:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Urijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shemaiah	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
against	1
this	1
city	1
and	1
against	1
this	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
when	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
heard	1
his	1
words,	1
the	1
king	1
sought	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
but	1
when	1
Urijah	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
26:22	1
And	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
men	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
namely,	1
Elnathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Achbor,	1
and	1
certain	1
men	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
they	1
fetched	1
forth	1
Urijah	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king;	1
who	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
dead	1
body	1
into	1
the	1
graves	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
people.	1
	1
26:24	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan	1
was	1
with	1
Jeremiah,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
27:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
27:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
me;	1
Make	1
thee	1
bonds	1
and	1
yokes,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
thy	1
neck,	1
27:3	1
And	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
messengers	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
27:4	1
And	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
their	1
masters,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
your	1
masters;	1
27:5	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
by	1
my	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
outstretched	1
arm,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
whom	1
it	1
seemed	1
meet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
all	1
these	1
lands	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
him	1
also	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
his	1
son's	1
son,	1
until	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
come:	1
and	1
then	1
many	1
nations	1
and	1
great	1
kings	1
shall	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
kingdom	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
same	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
their	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
nation	1
will	1
I	1
punish,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
27:9	1
Therefore	1
hearken	1
not	1
ye	1
to	1
your	1
prophets,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
diviners,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
dreamers,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
enchanters,	1
nor	1
to	1
your	1
sorcerers,	1
which	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
27:10	1
For	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you,	1
to	1
remove	1
you	1
far	1
from	1
your	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
drive	1
you	1
out,	1
and	1
ye	1
should	1
perish.	1
	1
27:11	1
But	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
bring	1
their	1
neck	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
those	1
will	1
I	1
let	1
remain	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
till	1
it,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
27:12	1
I	1
spake	1
also	1
to	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
your	1
necks	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
27:13	1
Why	1
will	1
ye	1
die,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
people,	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
nation	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon?	1
	1
27:14	1
Therefore	1
hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
for	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
yet	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
in	1
my	1
name;	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
drive	1
you	1
out,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
perish,	1
ye,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:16	1
Also	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
your	1
prophets	1
that	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
now	1
shortly	1
be	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
Babylon:	1
for	1
they	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
27:17	1
Hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
live:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
laid	1
waste?	1
	1
27:18	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
prophets,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
let	1
them	1
now	1
make	1
intercession	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
go	1
not	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
27:19	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
concerning	1
the	1
pillars,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
bases,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
27:20	1
Which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
took	1
not,	1
when	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem;	1
27:21	1
Yea,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
concerning	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
27:22	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
visit	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
restore	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
that	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azur	1
the	1
prophet,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
28:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
28:3	1
Within	1
two	1
full	1
years	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
again	1
into	1
this	1
place	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
took	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
28:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
to	1
this	1
place	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
went	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
28:5	1
Then	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
Hananiah	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
28:6	1
Even	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
Amen:	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
so:	1
the	1
LORD	1
perform	1
thy	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prophesied,	1
to	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
carried	1
away	1
captive,	1
from	1
Babylon	1
into	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
28:7	1
Nevertheless	1
hear	1
thou	1
now	1
this	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
thine	1
ears,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people;	1
28:8	1
The	1
prophets	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
before	1
thee	1
of	1
old	1
prophesied	1
both	1
against	1
many	1
countries,	1
and	1
against	1
great	1
kingdoms,	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
of	1
evil,	1
and	1
of	1
pestilence.	1
	1
28:9	1
The	1
prophet	1
which	1
prophesieth	1
of	1
peace,	1
when	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
prophet	1
be	1
known,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
truly	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
28:10	1
Then	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
took	1
the	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah's	1
neck,	1
and	1
brake	1
it.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
Hananiah	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
from	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
full	1
years.	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
28:12	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
after	1
that	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
28:13	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
Hananiah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thou	1
hast	1
broken	1
the	1
yokes	1
of	1
wood;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
for	1
them	1
yokes	1
of	1
iron.	1
	1
28:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
iron	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
nations,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
also.	1
	1
28:15	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
Hananiah;	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
thee;	1
but	1
thou	1
makest	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
28:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
this	1
year	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:17	1
So	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
died	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
29:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
sent	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
29:2	1
(After	1
that	1
Jeconiah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
the	1
queen,	1
and	1
the	1
eunuchs,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
the	1
smiths,	1
were	1
departed	1
from	1
Jerusalem;)	1
29:3	1
By	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Elasah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Gemariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
(whom	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
sent	1
unto	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon)	1
saying,	1
29:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Babylon;	1
29:5	1
Build	1
ye	1
houses,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
plant	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them;	1
29:6	1
Take	1
ye	1
wives,	1
and	1
beget	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters;	1
and	1
take	1
wives	1
for	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
give	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
husbands,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bear	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
increased	1
there,	1
and	1
not	1
diminished.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
seek	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captives,	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
it:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
peace	1
thereof	1
shall	1
ye	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
29:8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
prophets	1
and	1
your	1
diviners,	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
deceive	1
you,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
to	1
your	1
dreams	1
which	1
ye	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
dreamed.	1
	1
29:9	1
For	1
they	1
prophesy	1
falsely	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sent	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:10	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
That	1
after	1
seventy	1
years	1
be	1
accomplished	1
at	1
Babylon	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
perform	1
my	1
good	1
word	1
toward	1
you,	1
in	1
causing	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
29:11	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
toward	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thoughts	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
evil,	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
expected	1
end.	1
	1
29:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
call	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
me,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
search	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
29:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
away	1
your	1
captivity,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
you	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
whence	1
I	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive.	1
	1
29:15	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
prophets	1
in	1
Babylon;	1
29:16	1
Know	1
that	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
gone	1
forth	1
with	1
you	1
into	1
captivity;	1
29:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
sword,	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
like	1
vile	1
figs,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
evil.	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
persecute	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
with	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing,	1
and	1
a	1
reproach,	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them:	1
29:19	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
words,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them;	1
but	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:20	1
Hear	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon:	1
29:21	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
Ahab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kolaiah,	1
and	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah,	1
which	1
prophesy	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
name;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
them	1
before	1
your	1
eyes;	1
29:22	1
And	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
a	1
curse	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
thee	1
like	1
Zedekiah	1
and	1
like	1
Ahab,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
roasted	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
29:23	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
villany	1
in	1
Israel,	1
and	1
have	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
their	1
neighbours'	1
wives,	1
and	1
have	1
spoken	1
lying	1
words	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
commanded	1
them;	1
even	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
a	1
witness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:24	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
also	1
speak	1
to	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite,	1
saying,	1
29:25	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
letters	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
29:26	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
priest	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
mad,	1
and	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prophet,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
29:27	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
reproved	1
Jeremiah	1
of	1
Anathoth,	1
which	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
prophet	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
29:28	1
For	1
therefore	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
saying,	1
This	1
captivity	1
is	1
long:	1
build	1
ye	1
houses,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
plant	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
priest	1
read	1
this	1
letter	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
29:30	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
29:31	1
Send	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite;	1
Because	1
that	1
Shemaiah	1
hath	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
not,	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
you	1
to	1
trust	1
in	1
a	1
lie:	1
29:32	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
Nehelamite,	1
and	1
his	1
seed:	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
dwell	1
among	1
this	1
people;	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
behold	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
people,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
taught	1
rebellion	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
30:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Write	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
30:3	1
For,	1
lo,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
concerning	1
Israel	1
and	1
concerning	1
Judah.	1
	1
30:5	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
trembling,	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
30:6	1
Ask	1
ye	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
a	1
man	1
doth	1
travail	1
with	1
child?	1
wherefore	1
do	1
I	1
see	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
loins,	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail,	1
and	1
all	1
faces	1
are	1
turned	1
into	1
paleness?	1
	1
30:7	1
Alas!	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
is	1
great,	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
is	1
like	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
trouble,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
30:8	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
will	1
burst	1
thy	1
bonds,	1
and	1
strangers	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
him:	1
30:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
David	1
their	1
king,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
30:10	1
Therefore	1
fear	1
thou	1
not,	1
O	1
my	1
servant	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
neither	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
from	1
afar,	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
captivity;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
rest,	1
and	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
afraid.	1
	1
30:11	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
save	1
thee:	1
though	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
scattered	1
thee,	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
correct	1
thee	1
in	1
measure,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee	1
altogether	1
unpunished.	1
	1
30:12	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thy	1
bruise	1
is	1
incurable,	1
and	1
thy	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous.	1
	1
30:13	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
plead	1
thy	1
cause,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
bound	1
up:	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
healing	1
medicines.	1
	1
30:14	1
All	1
thy	1
lovers	1
have	1
forgotten	1
thee;	1
they	1
seek	1
thee	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
wounded	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
wound	1
of	1
an	1
enemy,	1
with	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
a	1
cruel	1
one,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity;	1
because	1
thy	1
sins	1
were	1
increased.	1
	1
30:15	1
Why	1
criest	1
thou	1
for	1
thine	1
affliction?	1
thy	1
sorrow	1
is	1
incurable	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity:	1
because	1
thy	1
sins	1
were	1
increased,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
30:16	1
Therefore	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
devour	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured;	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
spoil	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
prey	1
upon	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
30:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
health	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
thee	1
of	1
thy	1
wounds,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
they	1
called	1
thee	1
an	1
Outcast,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
Zion,	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
seeketh	1
after.	1
	1
30:18	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
tents,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
his	1
dwellingplaces;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
builded	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
heap,	1
and	1
the	1
palace	1
shall	1
remain	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
thereof.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
proceed	1
thanksgiving	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
merry:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
few;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
glorify	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
small.	1
	1
30:20	1
Their	1
children	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
aforetime,	1
and	1
their	1
congregation	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
all	1
that	1
oppress	1
them.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
their	1
nobles	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
governor	1
shall	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
draw	1
near,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
approach	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
engaged	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
approach	1
unto	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
30:23	1
Behold,	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
goeth	1
forth	1
with	1
fury,	1
a	1
continuing	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
pain	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
30:24	1
The	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
not	1
return,	1
until	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
intents	1
of	1
his	1
heart:	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
consider	1
it.	1
	1
31:1	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
31:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
people	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
even	1
Israel,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
rest.	1
	1
31:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
appeared	1
of	1
old	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee	1
with	1
an	1
everlasting	1
love:	1
therefore	1
with	1
lovingkindness	1
have	1
I	1
drawn	1
thee.	1
	1
31:4	1
Again	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built,	1
O	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
again	1
be	1
adorned	1
with	1
thy	1
tabrets,	1
and	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
dances	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
merry.	1
	1
31:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
yet	1
plant	1
vines	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
the	1
planters	1
shall	1
plant,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
them	1
as	1
common	1
things.	1
	1
31:6	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
watchmen	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
cry,	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Zion	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
31:7	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Sing	1
with	1
gladness	1
for	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
shout	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
publish	1
ye,	1
praise	1
ye,	1
and	1
say,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
save	1
thy	1
people,	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
country,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
travaileth	1
with	1
child	1
together:	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
shall	1
return	1
thither.	1
	1
31:9	1
They	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
supplications	1
will	1
I	1
lead	1
them:	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
way,	1
wherein	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
stumble:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
my	1
firstborn.	1
	1
31:10	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
ye	1
nations,	1
and	1
declare	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
isles	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
say,	1
He	1
that	1
scattered	1
Israel	1
will	1
gather	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
doth	1
his	1
flock.	1
	1
31:11	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ransomed	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
31:12	1
Therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
flow	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
wheat,	1
and	1
for	1
wine,	1
and	1
for	1
oil,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
herd:	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
watered	1
garden;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
sorrow	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
31:13	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
virgin	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
dance,	1
both	1
young	1
men	1
and	1
old	1
together:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
their	1
mourning	1
into	1
joy,	1
and	1
will	1
comfort	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
rejoice	1
from	1
their	1
sorrow.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
satiate	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
with	1
fatness,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
goodness,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
A	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
bitter	1
weeping;	1
Rahel	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not.	1
	1
31:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Refrain	1
thy	1
voice	1
from	1
weeping,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
from	1
tears:	1
for	1
thy	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
31:17	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
in	1
thine	1
end,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thy	1
children	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
border.	1
	1
31:18	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
heard	1
Ephraim	1
bemoaning	1
himself	1
thus;	1
Thou	1
hast	1
chastised	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
chastised,	1
as	1
a	1
bullock	1
unaccustomed	1
to	1
the	1
yoke:	1
turn	1
thou	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
turned;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
31:19	1
Surely	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
turned,	1
I	1
repented;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
instructed,	1
I	1
smote	1
upon	1
my	1
thigh:	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed,	1
yea,	1
even	1
confounded,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
31:20	1
Is	1
Ephraim	1
my	1
dear	1
son?	1
is	1
he	1
a	1
pleasant	1
child?	1
for	1
since	1
I	1
spake	1
against	1
him,	1
I	1
do	1
earnestly	1
remember	1
him	1
still:	1
therefore	1
my	1
bowels	1
are	1
troubled	1
for	1
him;	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:21	1
Set	1
thee	1
up	1
waymarks,	1
make	1
thee	1
high	1
heaps:	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
toward	1
the	1
highway,	1
even	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
thou	1
wentest:	1
turn	1
again,	1
O	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel,	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
these	1
thy	1
cities.	1
	1
31:22	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
about,	1
O	1
thou	1
backsliding	1
daughter?	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
created	1
a	1
new	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
A	1
woman	1
shall	1
compass	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
31:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
As	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
use	1
this	1
speech	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
their	1
captivity;	1
The	1
LORD	1
bless	1
thee,	1
O	1
habitation	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
mountain	1
of	1
holiness.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Judah	1
itself,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
together,	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
flocks.	1
	1
31:25	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
satiated	1
the	1
weary	1
soul,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
replenished	1
every	1
sorrowful	1
soul.	1
	1
31:26	1
Upon	1
this	1
I	1
awaked,	1
and	1
beheld;	1
and	1
my	1
sleep	1
was	1
sweet	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
31:27	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
beast.	1
	1
31:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
watched	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
pluck	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
to	1
afflict;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
watch	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
to	1
plant,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:29	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
fathers	1
have	1
eaten	1
a	1
sour	1
grape,	1
and	1
the	1
children's	1
teeth	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
	1
31:30	1
But	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
die	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
iniquity:	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
the	1
sour	1
grape,	1
his	1
teeth	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
edge.	1
	1
31:31	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
31:32	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
which	1
my	1
covenant	1
they	1
brake,	1
although	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
husband	1
unto	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
31:33	1
But	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
After	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
law	1
in	1
their	1
inward	1
parts,	1
and	1
write	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
hearts;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
31:34	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
no	1
more	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
forgive	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
their	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
31:35	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
giveth	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
by	1
night,	1
which	1
divideth	1
the	1
sea	1
when	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof	1
roar;	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
31:36	1
If	1
those	1
ordinances	1
depart	1
from	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
shall	1
cease	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
nation	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
31:37	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
heaven	1
above	1
can	1
be	1
measured,	1
and	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
searched	1
out	1
beneath,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:38	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
31:39	1
And	1
the	1
measuring	1
line	1
shall	1
yet	1
go	1
forth	1
over	1
against	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
hill	1
Gareb,	1
and	1
shall	1
compass	1
about	1
to	1
Goath.	1
	1
31:40	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ashes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fields	1
unto	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
Kidron,	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
gate	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
plucked	1
up,	1
nor	1
thrown	1
down	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar.	1
	1
32:2	1
For	1
then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
army	1
besieged	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah's	1
house.	1
	1
32:3	1
For	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
dost	1
thou	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
city	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
it;	1
32:4	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
not	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
but	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
his	1
eyes;	1
32:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
lead	1
Zedekiah	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
until	1
I	1
visit	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
though	1
ye	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
32:7	1
Behold,	1
Hanameel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shallum	1
thine	1
uncle	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
saying,	1
Buy	1
thee	1
my	1
field	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Anathoth:	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
redemption	1
is	1
thine	1
to	1
buy	1
it.	1
	1
32:8	1
So	1
Hanameel	1
mine	1
uncle's	1
son	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Buy	1
my	1
field,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Anathoth,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
inheritance	1
is	1
thine,	1
and	1
the	1
redemption	1
is	1
thine;	1
buy	1
it	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
I	1
bought	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Hanameel	1
my	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Anathoth,	1
and	1
weighed	1
him	1
the	1
money,	1
even	1
seventeen	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
32:10	1
And	1
I	1
subscribed	1
the	1
evidence,	1
and	1
sealed	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
weighed	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
balances.	1
	1
32:11	1
So	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
both	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sealed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
custom,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
open:	1
32:12	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
unto	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Hanameel	1
mine	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
witnesses	1
that	1
subscribed	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
32:13	1
And	1
I	1
charged	1
Baruch	1
before	1
them,	1
saying,	1
32:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Take	1
these	1
evidences,	1
this	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase,	1
both	1
which	1
is	1
sealed,	1
and	1
this	1
evidence	1
which	1
is	1
open;	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
an	1
earthen	1
vessel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
continue	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
32:15	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Houses	1
and	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards	1
shall	1
be	1
possessed	1
again	1
in	1
this	1
land.	1
	1
32:16	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
delivered	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
purchase	1
unto	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
32:17	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
thy	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
thee:	1
32:18	1
Thou	1
shewest	1
lovingkindness	1
unto	1
thousands,	1
and	1
recompensest	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
into	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
after	1
them:	1
the	1
Great,	1
the	1
Mighty	1
God,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
32:19	1
Great	1
in	1
counsel,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
work:	1
for	1
thine	1
eyes	1
are	1
open	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men:	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
doings:	1
32:20	1
Which	1
hast	1
set	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
in	1
Israel,	1
and	1
among	1
other	1
men;	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
name,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
32:21	1
And	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
signs,	1
and	1
with	1
wonders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
terror;	1
32:22	1
And	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
this	1
land,	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
swear	1
to	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
them,	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
32:23	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
possessed	1
it;	1
but	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not	1
thy	1
voice,	1
neither	1
walked	1
in	1
thy	1
law;	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
commandedst	1
them	1
to	1
do:	1
therefore	1
thou	1
hast	1
caused	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
them:	1
32:24	1
Behold	1
the	1
mounts,	1
they	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
take	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
it,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
and	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
seest	1
it.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Buy	1
thee	1
the	1
field	1
for	1
money,	1
and	1
take	1
witnesses;	1
for	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
32:26	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
32:27	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
flesh:	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
thing	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
32:28	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
city	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
it:	1
32:29	1
And	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
this	1
city,	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
set	1
fire	1
on	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
houses,	1
upon	1
whose	1
roofs	1
they	1
have	1
offered	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
32:30	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
only	1
done	1
evil	1
before	1
me	1
from	1
their	1
youth:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
only	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:31	1
For	1
this	1
city	1
hath	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
provocation	1
of	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
fury	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
built	1
it	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day;	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
remove	1
it	1
from	1
before	1
my	1
face,	1
32:32	1
Because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger,	1
they,	1
their	1
kings,	1
their	1
princes,	1
their	1
priests,	1
and	1
their	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
32:33	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
face:	1
though	1
I	1
taught	1
them,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
teaching	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
to	1
receive	1
instruction.	1
	1
32:34	1
But	1
they	1
set	1
their	1
abominations	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
to	1
defile	1
it.	1
	1
32:35	1
And	1
they	1
built	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Baal,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
to	1
cause	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire	1
unto	1
Molech;	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
came	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
mind,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
abomination,	1
to	1
cause	1
Judah	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
32:36	1
And	1
now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
concerning	1
this	1
city,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
say,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence;	1
32:37	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
countries,	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
wrath;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
dwell	1
safely:	1
32:38	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God:	1
32:39	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
one	1
heart,	1
and	1
one	1
way,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
fear	1
me	1
for	1
ever,	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
children	1
after	1
them:	1
32:40	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
good;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
fear	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
32:41	1
Yea,	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
good,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
land	1
assuredly	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
soul.	1
	1
32:42	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Like	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
people,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
them.	1
	1
32:43	1
And	1
fields	1
shall	1
be	1
bought	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
desolate	1
without	1
man	1
or	1
beast;	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
32:44	1
Men	1
shall	1
buy	1
fields	1
for	1
money,	1
and	1
subscribe	1
evidences,	1
and	1
seal	1
them,	1
and	1
take	1
witnesses	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
their	1
captivity	1
to	1
return,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
saying,	1
33:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof,	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
formed	1
it,	1
to	1
establish	1
it;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name;	1
33:3	1
Call	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
thee	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
things,	1
which	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not.	1
	1
33:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
concerning	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
are	1
thrown	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
mounts,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
33:5	1
They	1
come	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
fill	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
men,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
in	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
whose	1
wickedness	1
I	1
have	1
hid	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
33:6	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
health	1
and	1
cure,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cure	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
reveal	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
return,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
them,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cleanse	1
them	1
from	1
all	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pardon	1
all	1
their	1
iniquities,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
33:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
name	1
of	1
joy,	1
a	1
praise	1
and	1
an	1
honour	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
shall	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fear	1
and	1
tremble	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
prosperity	1
that	1
I	1
procure	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
33:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Again	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
which	1
ye	1
say	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
without	1
man	1
and	1
without	1
beast,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
are	1
desolate,	1
without	1
man,	1
and	1
without	1
inhabitant,	1
and	1
without	1
beast,	1
33:11	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
gladness,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
shall	1
say,	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
good;	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
praise	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
return	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Again	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
desolate	1
without	1
man	1
and	1
without	1
beast,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
shepherds	1
causing	1
their	1
flocks	1
to	1
lie	1
down.	1
	1
33:13	1
In	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
vale,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
shall	1
the	1
flocks	1
pass	1
again	1
under	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
telleth	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
that	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
33:15	1
In	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
the	1
Branch	1
of	1
righteousness	1
to	1
grow	1
up	1
unto	1
David;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
execute	1
judgment	1
and	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
33:16	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
Judah	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
wherewith	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called,	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
righteousness.	1
	1
33:17	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
David	1
shall	1
never	1
want	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
33:18	1
Neither	1
shall	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
want	1
a	1
man	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
to	1
kindle	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
continually.	1
	1
33:19	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
33:20	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
ye	1
can	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
my	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
their	1
season;	1
33:21	1
Then	1
may	1
also	1
my	1
covenant	1
be	1
broken	1
with	1
David	1
my	1
servant,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
reign	1
upon	1
his	1
throne;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Levites	1
the	1
priests,	1
my	1
ministers.	1
	1
33:22	1
As	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered,	1
neither	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
measured:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
multiply	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
servant,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
minister	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
33:23	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
33:24	1
Considerest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
this	1
people	1
have	1
spoken,	1
saying,	1
The	1
two	1
families	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
he	1
hath	1
even	1
cast	1
them	1
off?	1
thus	1
they	1
have	1
despised	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
nation	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
33:25	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
If	1
my	1
covenant	1
be	1
not	1
with	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
appointed	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth;	1
33:26	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Jacob	1
and	1
David	1
my	1
servant,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
to	1
be	1
rulers	1
over	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
their	1
captivity	1
to	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
34:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
of	1
his	1
dominion,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
saying,	1
34:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Go	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
tell	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
city	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire:	1
34:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
but	1
shalt	1
surely	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
delivered	1
into	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
thee	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
34:4	1
Yet	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
34:5	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
in	1
peace:	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
burnings	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
the	1
former	1
kings	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
thee,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
burn	1
odours	1
for	1
thee;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
lament	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Ah	1
lord!	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
the	1
word,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:6	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
spake	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
34:7	1
When	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
army	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
that	1
were	1
left,	1
against	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
against	1
Azekah:	1
for	1
these	1
defenced	1
cities	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
34:8	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
Zedekiah	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
proclaim	1
liberty	1
unto	1
them;	1
34:9	1
That	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
let	1
his	1
manservant,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
being	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
or	1
an	1
Hebrewess,	1
go	1
free;	1
that	1
none	1
should	1
serve	1
himself	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
wit,	1
of	1
a	1
Jew	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
34:10	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
had	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
covenant,	1
heard	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
should	1
let	1
his	1
manservant,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
go	1
free,	1
that	1
none	1
should	1
serve	1
themselves	1
of	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
then	1
they	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
34:11	1
But	1
afterward	1
they	1
turned,	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
the	1
handmaids,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
go	1
free,	1
to	1
return,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
subjection	1
for	1
servants	1
and	1
for	1
handmaids.	1
	1
34:12	1
Therefore	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
34:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondmen,	1
saying,	1
34:14	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seven	1
years	1
let	1
ye	1
go	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother	1
an	1
Hebrew,	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
sold	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
served	1
thee	1
six	1
years,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free	1
from	1
thee:	1
but	1
your	1
fathers	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
me,	1
neither	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear.	1
	1
34:15	1
And	1
ye	1
were	1
now	1
turned,	1
and	1
had	1
done	1
right	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
in	1
proclaiming	1
liberty	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
ye	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
34:16	1
But	1
ye	1
turned	1
and	1
polluted	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
caused	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
handmaid,	1
whom	1
ye	1
had	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
at	1
their	1
pleasure,	1
to	1
return,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
subjection,	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
servants	1
and	1
for	1
handmaids.	1
	1
34:17	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
in	1
proclaiming	1
liberty,	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
behold,	1
I	1
proclaim	1
a	1
liberty	1
for	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
to	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
famine;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
34:18	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
have	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
performed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
before	1
me,	1
when	1
they	1
cut	1
the	1
calf	1
in	1
twain,	1
and	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
parts	1
thereof,	1
34:19	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
eunuchs,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
calf;	1
34:20	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
give	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
life:	1
and	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
meat	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
34:21	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
life,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
army,	1
which	1
are	1
gone	1
up	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
34:22	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
command,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
this	1
city;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
a	1
desolation	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
35:1	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
35:2	1
Go	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Rechabites,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chambers,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
wine	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
35:3	1
Then	1
I	1
took	1
Jaazaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeremiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Habaziniah,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Rechabites;	1
35:4	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Hanan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Igdaliah,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
princes,	1
which	1
was	1
above	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shallum,	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
door:	1
35:5	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Rechabites	1
pots	1
full	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
cups,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Drink	1
ye	1
wine.	1
	1
35:6	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
drink	1
no	1
wine:	1
for	1
Jonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab	1
our	1
father	1
commanded	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
drink	1
no	1
wine,	1
neither	1
ye,	1
nor	1
your	1
sons	1
for	1
ever:	1
35:7	1
Neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
build	1
house,	1
nor	1
sow	1
seed,	1
nor	1
plant	1
vineyard,	1
nor	1
have	1
any:	1
but	1
all	1
your	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
tents;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
where	1
ye	1
be	1
strangers.	1
	1
35:8	1
Thus	1
have	1
we	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Jonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab	1
our	1
father	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
charged	1
us,	1
to	1
drink	1
no	1
wine	1
all	1
our	1
days,	1
we,	1
our	1
wives,	1
our	1
sons,	1
nor	1
our	1
daughters;	1
35:9	1
Nor	1
to	1
build	1
houses	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
dwell	1
in:	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
vineyard,	1
nor	1
field,	1
nor	1
seed:	1
35:10	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents,	1
and	1
have	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Jonadab	1
our	1
father	1
commanded	1
us.	1
	1
35:11	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
we	1
said,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
so	1
we	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
35:12	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
35:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
Will	1
ye	1
not	1
receive	1
instruction	1
to	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
words?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
35:14	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Jonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab,	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
his	1
sons	1
not	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
are	1
performed;	1
for	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
they	1
drink	1
none,	1
but	1
obey	1
their	1
father's	1
commandment:	1
notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
speaking;	1
but	1
ye	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
35:15	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
also	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
up	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Return	1
ye	1
now	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
amend	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
other	1
gods	1
to	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
inclined	1
your	1
ear,	1
nor	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
35:16	1
Because	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
their	1
father,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
them;	1
but	1
this	1
people	1
hath	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me:	1
35:17	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
Judah	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
them:	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
unto	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
answered.	1
	1
35:18	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Rechabites,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
obeyed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Jonadab	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
kept	1
all	1
his	1
precepts,	1
and	1
done	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you:	1
35:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Jonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab	1
shall	1
not	1
want	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
36:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
this	1
word	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
36:2	1
Take	1
thee	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
write	1
therein	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
nations,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee,	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
36:3	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
will	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
purpose	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
forgive	1
their	1
iniquity	1
and	1
their	1
sin.	1
	1
36:4	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
called	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah:	1
and	1
Baruch	1
wrote	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him,	1
upon	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
36:5	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
commanded	1
Baruch,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
shut	1
up;	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
36:6	1
Therefore	1
go	1
thou,	1
and	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
roll,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
written	1
from	1
my	1
mouth,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
fasting	1
day:	1
and	1
also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
read	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
Judah	1
that	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
36:7	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
present	1
their	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
anger	1
and	1
the	1
fury	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
against	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
36:8	1
And	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
commanded	1
him,	1
reading	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house.	1
	1
36:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
that	1
they	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:10	1
Then	1
read	1
Baruch	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
Gemariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
in	1
the	1
higher	1
court,	1
at	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
36:11	1
When	1
Michaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gemariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
had	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
36:12	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
into	1
the	1
scribe's	1
chamber:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
sat	1
there,	1
even	1
Elishama	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Delaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
Elnathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Achbor,	1
and	1
Gemariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hananiah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes.	1
	1
36:13	1
Then	1
Michaiah	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard,	1
when	1
Baruch	1
read	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
36:14	1
Therefore	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
sent	1
Jehudi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shelemiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cushi,	1
unto	1
Baruch,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
in	1
thine	1
hand	1
the	1
roll	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
come.	1
So	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah	1
took	1
the	1
roll	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
36:15	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sit	1
down	1
now,	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
ears.	1
So	1
Baruch	1
read	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
ears.	1
	1
36:16	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
words,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
both	1
one	1
and	1
other,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Baruch,	1
We	1
will	1
surely	1
tell	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
36:17	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
Baruch,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us	1
now,	1
How	1
didst	1
thou	1
write	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
at	1
his	1
mouth?	1
	1
36:18	1
Then	1
Baruch	1
answered	1
them,	1
He	1
pronounced	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
wrote	1
them	1
with	1
ink	1
in	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
36:19	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
princes	1
unto	1
Baruch,	1
Go,	1
hide	1
thee,	1
thou	1
and	1
Jeremiah;	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
where	1
ye	1
be.	1
	1
36:20	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
into	1
the	1
court,	1
but	1
they	1
laid	1
up	1
the	1
roll	1
in	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
Elishama	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
36:21	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
Jehudi	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
roll:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
Elishama	1
the	1
scribe's	1
chamber.	1
And	1
Jehudi	1
read	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
which	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
36:22	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
winterhouse	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
month:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
hearth	1
burning	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
36:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jehudi	1
had	1
read	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
leaves,	1
he	1
cut	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
penknife,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
hearth,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
roll	1
was	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
hearth.	1
	1
36:24	1
Yet	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
afraid,	1
nor	1
rent	1
their	1
garments,	1
neither	1
the	1
king,	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
heard	1
all	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
36:25	1
Nevertheless	1
Elnathan	1
and	1
Delaiah	1
and	1
Gemariah	1
had	1
made	1
intercession	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
burn	1
the	1
roll:	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
36:26	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Jerahmeel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammelech,	1
and	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azriel,	1
and	1
Shelemiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abdeel,	1
to	1
take	1
Baruch	1
the	1
scribe	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
hid	1
them.	1
	1
36:27	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
burned	1
the	1
roll,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
Baruch	1
wrote	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
36:28	1
Take	1
thee	1
again	1
another	1
roll,	1
and	1
write	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
former	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
roll,	1
which	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
hath	1
burned.	1
	1
36:29	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
to	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thou	1
hast	1
burned	1
this	1
roll,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
written	1
therein,	1
saying,	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
thence	1
man	1
and	1
beast?	1
	1
36:30	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
He	1
shall	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
his	1
dead	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
the	1
frost.	1
	1
36:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
pronounced	1
against	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not.	1
	1
36:32	1
Then	1
took	1
Jeremiah	1
another	1
roll,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Baruch	1
the	1
scribe,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah;	1
who	1
wrote	1
therein	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
added	1
besides	1
unto	1
them	1
many	1
like	1
words.	1
	1
37:1	1
And	1
king	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
reigned	1
instead	1
of	1
Coniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiakim,	1
whom	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
made	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
37:2	1
But	1
neither	1
he,	1
nor	1
his	1
servants,	1
nor	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
did	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
37:3	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
Jehucal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shelemiah	1
and	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
priest	1
to	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
Pray	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
37:4	1
Now	1
Jeremiah	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
put	1
him	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
37:5	1
Then	1
Pharaoh's	1
army	1
was	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
that	1
besieged	1
Jerusalem	1
heard	1
tidings	1
of	1
them,	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
37:6	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jeremiah	1
saying,	1
37:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
sent	1
you	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
me;	1
Behold,	1
Pharaoh's	1
army,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
help	1
you,	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
37:8	1
And	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
shall	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
37:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Deceive	1
not	1
yourselves,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Chaldeans	1
shall	1
surely	1
depart	1
from	1
us:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
depart.	1
	1
37:10	1
For	1
though	1
ye	1
had	1
smitten	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
that	1
fight	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
but	1
wounded	1
men	1
among	1
them,	1
yet	1
should	1
they	1
rise	1
up	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
burn	1
this	1
city	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
37:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
was	1
broken	1
up	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
army,	1
37:12	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
to	1
separate	1
himself	1
thence	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
37:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
ward	1
was	1
there,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Irijah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shelemiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hananiah;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
fallest	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
37:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah,	1
It	1
is	1
false;	1
I	1
fall	1
not	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
to	1
him:	1
so	1
Irijah	1
took	1
Jeremiah,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
princes.	1
	1
37:15	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
princes	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
Jeremiah,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
scribe:	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
that	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
37:16	1
When	1
Jeremiah	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
cabins,	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
had	1
remained	1
there	1
many	1
days;	1
37:17	1
Then	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
out:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
asked	1
him	1
secretly	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
LORD?	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
There	1
is:	1
for,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
37:18	1
Moreover	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
king	1
Zedekiah,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
against	1
thee,	1
or	1
against	1
thy	1
servants,	1
or	1
against	1
this	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
prison?	1
	1
37:19	1
Where	1
are	1
now	1
your	1
prophets	1
which	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
against	1
you,	1
nor	1
against	1
this	1
land?	1
	1
37:20	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
O	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
let	1
my	1
supplication,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
accepted	1
before	1
thee;	1
that	1
thou	1
cause	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
lest	1
I	1
die	1
there.	1
	1
37:21	1
Then	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
commit	1
Jeremiah	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
daily	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bakers'	1
street,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
were	1
spent.	1
	1
Thus	1
Jeremiah	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
38:1	1
Then	1
Shephatiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mattan,	1
and	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pashur,	1
and	1
Jucal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shelemiah,	1
and	1
Pashur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Malchiah,	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
38:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
He	1
that	1
remaineth	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
shall	1
live;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
38:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
This	1
city	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
army,	1
which	1
shall	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
38:4	1
Therefore	1
the	1
princes	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
We	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
thus	1
he	1
weakeneth	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
in	1
speaking	1
such	1
words	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
seeketh	1
not	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
this	1
people,	1
but	1
the	1
hurt.	1
	1
38:5	1
Then	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hand:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
can	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
38:6	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
Jeremiah,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon	1
of	1
Malchiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammelech,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison:	1
and	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
Jeremiah	1
with	1
cords.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
dungeon	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water,	1
but	1
mire:	1
so	1
Jeremiah	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
38:7	1
Now	1
when	1
Ebedmelech	1
the	1
Ethiopian,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
Jeremiah	1
in	1
the	1
dungeon;	1
the	1
king	1
then	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Benjamin;	1
38:8	1
Ebedmelech	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
saying,	1
38:9	1
My	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
these	1
men	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
hunger	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
is:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
38:10	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Ebedmelech	1
the	1
Ethiopian,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
from	1
hence	1
thirty	1
men	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dungeon,	1
before	1
he	1
die.	1
	1
38:11	1
So	1
Ebedmelech	1
took	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
under	1
the	1
treasury,	1
and	1
took	1
thence	1
old	1
cast	1
clouts	1
and	1
old	1
rotten	1
rags,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
down	1
by	1
cords	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon	1
to	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
38:12	1
And	1
Ebedmelech	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
said	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
Put	1
now	1
these	1
old	1
cast	1
clouts	1
and	1
rotten	1
rags	1
under	1
thine	1
armholes	1
under	1
the	1
cords.	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
38:13	1
So	1
they	1
drew	1
up	1
Jeremiah	1
with	1
cords,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dungeon:	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
38:14	1
Then	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
third	1
entry	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
thee	1
a	1
thing;	1
hide	1
nothing	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
38:15	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
Zedekiah,	1
If	1
I	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
surely	1
put	1
me	1
to	1
death?	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
counsel,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
38:16	1
So	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
sware	1
secretly	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
made	1
us	1
this	1
soul,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
death,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
that	1
seek	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
38:17	1
Then	1
said	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
Zedekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
assuredly	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
princes,	1
then	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live,	1
and	1
thine	1
house:	1
38:18	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
princes,	1
then	1
shall	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
38:19	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
are	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
lest	1
they	1
deliver	1
me	1
into	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
mock	1
me.	1
	1
38:20	1
But	1
Jeremiah	1
said,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
Obey,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee:	1
so	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
38:21	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
go	1
forth,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me:	1
38:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
princes,	1
and	1
those	1
women	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thy	1
friends	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
on,	1
and	1
have	1
prevailed	1
against	1
thee:	1
thy	1
feet	1
are	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
mire,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
turned	1
away	1
back.	1
	1
38:23	1
So	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
out	1
all	1
thy	1
wives	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand,	1
but	1
shalt	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
this	1
city	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
38:24	1
Then	1
said	1
Zedekiah	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
of	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
38:25	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
princes	1
hear	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
talked	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
now	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
death;	1
also	1
what	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
thee:	1
38:26	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
presented	1
my	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Jonathan's	1
house,	1
to	1
die	1
there.	1
	1
38:27	1
Then	1
came	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
and	1
asked	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
commanded.	1
So	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
speaking	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
not	1
perceived.	1
	1
38:28	1
So	1
Jeremiah	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
taken:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
when	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
39:1	1
In	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
came	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
they	1
besieged	1
it.	1
	1
39:2	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
Zedekiah,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
the	1
ninth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
broken	1
up.	1
	1
39:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
gate,	1
even	1
Nergalsharezer,	1
Samgarnebo,	1
Sarsechim,	1
Rabsaris,	1
Nergalsharezer,	1
Rabmag,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
saw	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
then	1
they	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
night,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
garden,	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
betwixt	1
the	1
two	1
walls:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
plain.	1
	1
39:5	1
But	1
the	1
Chaldeans'	1
army	1
pursued	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
overtook	1
Zedekiah	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
him,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Riblah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
judgment	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
39:6	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
slew	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
in	1
Riblah	1
before	1
his	1
eyes:	1
also	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
39:7	1
Moreover	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
Zedekiah's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
chains,	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
39:8	1
And	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
burned	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
39:9	1
Then	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
Babylon	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
fell	1
away,	1
that	1
fell	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
remained.	1
	1
39:10	1
But	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
had	1
nothing,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
vineyards	1
and	1
fields	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
39:11	1
Now	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
gave	1
charge	1
concerning	1
Jeremiah	1
to	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
saying,	1
39:12	1
Take	1
him,	1
and	1
look	1
well	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
harm;	1
but	1
do	1
unto	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
39:13	1
So	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
sent,	1
and	1
Nebushasban,	1
Rabsaris,	1
and	1
Nergalsharezer,	1
Rabmag,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon's	1
princes;	1
39:14	1
Even	1
they	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
Jeremiah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
committed	1
him	1
unto	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
carry	1
him	1
home:	1
so	1
he	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
39:15	1
Now	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
saying,	1
39:16	1
Go	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
Ebedmelech	1
the	1
Ethiopian,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
my	1
words	1
upon	1
this	1
city	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
39:17	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
afraid.	1
	1
39:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
but	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
unto	1
thee:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
thy	1
trust	1
in	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
40:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
that	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
had	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
from	1
Ramah,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
being	1
bound	1
in	1
chains	1
among	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
Judah,	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
unto	1
Babylon.	1
	1
40:2	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
Jeremiah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
pronounced	1
this	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
40:3	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
it,	1
and	1
done	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said:	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
his	1
voice,	1
therefore	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
loose	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
chains	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand.	1
If	1
it	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
come;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
well	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
seem	1
ill	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
into	1
Babylon,	1
forbear:	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
before	1
thee:	1
whither	1
it	1
seemeth	1
good	1
and	1
convenient	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
go,	1
thither	1
go.	1
	1
40:5	1
Now	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
gone	1
back,	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
back	1
also	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
made	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
dwell	1
with	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
or	1
go	1
wheresoever	1
it	1
seemeth	1
convenient	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
go.	1
So	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
gave	1
him	1
victuals	1
and	1
a	1
reward,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
40:6	1
Then	1
went	1
Jeremiah	1
unto	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
to	1
Mizpah;	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
40:7	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
even	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
men,	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
made	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
governor	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
had	1
committed	1
unto	1
him	1
men,	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
40:8	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
to	1
Mizpah,	1
even	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
Johanan	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tanhumeth,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ephai	1
the	1
Netophathite,	1
and	1
Jezaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Maachathite,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
men.	1
	1
40:9	1
And	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan	1
sware	1
unto	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
men,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
40:10	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
at	1
Mizpah,	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
which	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
us:	1
but	1
ye,	1
gather	1
ye	1
wine,	1
and	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
vessels,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
cities	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
taken.	1
	1
40:11	1
Likewise	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Moab,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
in	1
Edom,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
countries,	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
them	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan;	1
40:12	1
Even	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
they	1
were	1
driven,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
to	1
Gedaliah,	1
unto	1
Mizpah,	1
and	1
gathered	1
wine	1
and	1
summer	1
fruits	1
very	1
much.	1
	1
40:13	1
Moreover	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
came	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
to	1
Mizpah,	1
40:14	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
certainly	1
know	1
that	1
Baalis	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
hath	1
sent	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
to	1
slay	1
thee?	1
But	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
40:15	1
Then	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah	1
spake	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
in	1
Mizpah	1
secretly	1
saying,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
know	1
it:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
he	1
slay	1
thee,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thee	1
should	1
be	1
scattered,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
in	1
Judah	1
perish?	1
	1
40:16	1
But	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
said	1
unto	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
thing:	1
for	1
thou	1
speakest	1
falsely	1
of	1
Ishmael.	1
	1
41:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elishama,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
royal,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
even	1
ten	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
unto	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
to	1
Mizpah;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
together	1
in	1
Mizpah.	1
	1
41:2	1
Then	1
arose	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
the	1
ten	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
made	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
41:3	1
Ishmael	1
also	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
with	1
Gedaliah,	1
at	1
Mizpah,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
41:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
Gedaliah,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knew	1
it,	1
41:5	1
That	1
there	1
came	1
certain	1
from	1
Shechem,	1
from	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
from	1
Samaria,	1
even	1
fourscore	1
men,	1
having	1
their	1
beards	1
shaven,	1
and	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
having	1
cut	1
themselves,	1
with	1
offerings	1
and	1
incense	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
41:6	1
And	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
went	1
forth	1
from	1
Mizpah	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
weeping	1
all	1
along	1
as	1
he	1
went:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
met	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam.	1
	1
41:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
he,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
41:8	1
But	1
ten	1
men	1
were	1
found	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
Ishmael,	1
Slay	1
us	1
not:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
treasures	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
of	1
honey.	1
So	1
he	1
forbare,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
not	1
among	1
their	1
brethren.	1
	1
41:9	1
Now	1
the	1
pit	1
wherein	1
Ishmael	1
had	1
cast	1
all	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
because	1
of	1
Gedaliah,	1
was	1
it	1
which	1
Asa	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain.	1
	1
41:10	1
Then	1
Ishmael	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
all	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Mizpah,	1
even	1
the	1
king's	1
daughters,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
Mizpah,	1
whom	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
had	1
committed	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam:	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
carried	1
them	1
away	1
captive,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Ammonites.	1
	1
41:11	1
But	1
when	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
had	1
done,	1
41:12	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
waters	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
41:13	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
Ishmael	1
saw	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
glad.	1
	1
41:14	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
from	1
Mizpah	1
cast	1
about	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah.	1
	1
41:15	1
But	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
escaped	1
from	1
Johanan	1
with	1
eight	1
men,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Ammonites.	1
	1
41:16	1
Then	1
took	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
recovered	1
from	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
from	1
Mizpah,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam,	1
even	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
eunuchs,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
Gibeon:	1
41:17	1
And	1
they	1
departed,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
Chimham,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
Bethlehem,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
41:18	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
them,	1
because	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah	1
had	1
slain	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
made	1
governor	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
42:1	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
and	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
Jezaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hoshaiah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest,	1
came	1
near,	1
42:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
Let,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
our	1
supplication	1
be	1
accepted	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
even	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
remnant;	1
(for	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
many,	1
as	1
thine	1
eyes	1
do	1
behold	1
us:)	1
42:3	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
may	1
shew	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
we	1
may	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
do.	1
	1
42:4	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you;	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
words;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
answer	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you;	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
nothing	1
back	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
42:5	1
Then	1
they	1
said	1
to	1
Jeremiah,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
a	1
true	1
and	1
faithful	1
witness	1
between	1
us,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
42:6	1
Whether	1
it	1
be	1
good,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
evil,	1
we	1
will	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
send	1
thee;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
us,	1
when	1
we	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
42:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
ten	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
42:8	1
Then	1
called	1
he	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
greatest,	1
42:9	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
whom	1
ye	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
your	1
supplication	1
before	1
him;	1
42:10	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
still	1
abide	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
build	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
pull	1
you	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
pluck	1
you	1
up:	1
for	1
I	1
repent	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
42:11	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
are	1
afraid;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
42:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
mercies	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
42:13	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
neither	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
42:14	1
Saying,	1
No;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
war,	1
nor	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
nor	1
have	1
hunger	1
of	1
bread;	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
we	1
dwell:	1
42:15	1
And	1
now	1
therefore	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
If	1
ye	1
wholly	1
set	1
your	1
faces	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
42:16	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
ye	1
feared,	1
shall	1
overtake	1
you	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
famine,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
were	1
afraid,	1
shall	1
follow	1
close	1
after	1
you	1
there	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
there	1
ye	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
42:17	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
set	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
remain	1
or	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
42:18	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
As	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
my	1
fury	1
hath	1
been	1
poured	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
so	1
shall	1
my	1
fury	1
be	1
poured	1
forth	1
upon	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
execration,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
a	1
reproach;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
this	1
place	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
42:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
concerning	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah;	1
Go	1
ye	1
not	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
know	1
certainly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
admonished	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
42:20	1
For	1
ye	1
dissembled	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
when	1
ye	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Pray	1
for	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
say,	1
so	1
declare	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
42:21	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
you;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
42:22	1
Now	1
therefore	1
know	1
certainly	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
ye	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
to	1
sojourn.	1
	1
43:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jeremiah	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
43:2	1
Then	1
spake	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hoshaiah,	1
and	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proud	1
men,	1
saying	1
unto	1
Jeremiah,	1
Thou	1
speakest	1
falsely:	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
thee	1
to	1
say,	1
Go	1
not	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there:	1
43:3	1
But	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah	1
setteth	1
thee	1
on	1
against	1
us,	1
for	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
us	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
carry	1
us	1
away	1
captives	1
into	1
Babylon.	1
	1
43:4	1
So	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
43:5	1
But	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kareah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
were	1
returned	1
from	1
all	1
nations,	1
whither	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
driven,	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah;	1
43:6	1
Even	1
men,	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
daughters,	1
and	1
every	1
person	1
that	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
had	1
left	1
with	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah.	1
	1
43:7	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
thus	1
came	1
they	1
even	1
to	1
Tahpanhes.	1
	1
43:8	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Jeremiah	1
in	1
Tahpanhes,	1
saying,	1
43:9	1
Take	1
great	1
stones	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
hide	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
clay	1
in	1
the	1
brickkiln,	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
house	1
in	1
Tahpanhes,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah;	1
43:10	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
and	1
take	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
my	1
servant,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
his	1
throne	1
upon	1
these	1
stones	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
hid;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
spread	1
his	1
royal	1
pavilion	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
43:11	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
deliver	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
death	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
captivity	1
to	1
captivity;	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
43:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
them,	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
away	1
captives:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
array	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
putteth	1
on	1
his	1
garment;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
thence	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
43:13	1
He	1
shall	1
break	1
also	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
he	1
burn	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
44:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
dwell	1
at	1
Migdol,	1
and	1
at	1
Tahpanhes,	1
and	1
at	1
Noph,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Pathros,	1
saying,	1
44:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
this	1
day	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
dwelleth	1
therein,	1
44:3	1
Because	1
of	1
their	1
wickedness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
burn	1
incense,	1
and	1
to	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not,	1
neither	1
they,	1
ye,	1
nor	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
44:4	1
Howbeit	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
rising	1
early	1
and	1
sending	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Oh,	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
abominable	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
44:5	1
But	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
their	1
ear	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
to	1
burn	1
no	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
44:6	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
fury	1
and	1
mine	1
anger	1
was	1
poured	1
forth,	1
and	1
was	1
kindled	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
wasted	1
and	1
desolate,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
44:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Wherefore	1
commit	1
ye	1
this	1
great	1
evil	1
against	1
your	1
souls,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
you	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
child	1
and	1
suckling,	1
out	1
of	1
Judah,	1
to	1
leave	1
you	1
none	1
to	1
remain;	1
44:8	1
In	1
that	1
ye	1
provoke	1
me	1
unto	1
wrath	1
with	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
your	1
hands,	1
burning	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
whither	1
ye	1
be	1
gone	1
to	1
dwell,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
cut	1
yourselves	1
off,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
curse	1
and	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
44:9	1
Have	1
ye	1
forgotten	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
your	1
own	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
your	1
wives,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
44:10	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
humbled	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
neither	1
have	1
they	1
feared,	1
nor	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
nor	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
that	1
I	1
set	1
before	1
you	1
and	1
before	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
44:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
you	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
Judah.	1
	1
44:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
have	1
set	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
consumed,	1
and	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
they	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine:	1
they	1
shall	1
die,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
greatest,	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
execration,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
a	1
reproach.	1
	1
44:13	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
punished	1
Jerusalem,	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence:	1
44:14	1
So	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there,	1
shall	1
escape	1
or	1
remain,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
to	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dwell	1
there:	1
for	1
none	1
shall	1
return	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
shall	1
escape.	1
	1
44:15	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
knew	1
that	1
their	1
wives	1
had	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
Pathros,	1
answered	1
Jeremiah,	1
saying,	1
44:16	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
44:17	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
certainly	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
goeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
mouth,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
her,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
we,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
our	1
kings,	1
and	1
our	1
princes,	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
then	1
had	1
we	1
plenty	1
of	1
victuals,	1
and	1
were	1
well,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
evil.	1
	1
44:18	1
But	1
since	1
we	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
her,	1
we	1
have	1
wanted	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine.	1
	1
44:19	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
her,	1
did	1
we	1
make	1
her	1
cakes	1
to	1
worship	1
her,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
her,	1
without	1
our	1
men?	1
	1
44:20	1
Then	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
that	1
answer,	1
saying,	1
44:21	1
The	1
incense	1
that	1
ye	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
ye,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers,	1
your	1
kings,	1
and	1
your	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
remember	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
it	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
mind?	1
	1
44:22	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
bear,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
your	1
doings,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
abominations	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
committed;	1
therefore	1
is	1
your	1
land	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
44:23	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
burned	1
incense,	1
and	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
walked	1
in	1
his	1
law,	1
nor	1
in	1
his	1
statutes,	1
nor	1
in	1
his	1
testimonies;	1
therefore	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
happened	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
44:24	1
Moreover	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
women,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
Judah	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
44:25	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying;	1
Ye	1
and	1
your	1
wives	1
have	1
both	1
spoken	1
with	1
your	1
mouths,	1
and	1
fulfilled	1
with	1
your	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
surely	1
perform	1
our	1
vows	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
vowed,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
pour	1
out	1
drink	1
offerings	1
unto	1
her:	1
ye	1
will	1
surely	1
accomplish	1
your	1
vows,	1
and	1
surely	1
perform	1
your	1
vows.	1
	1
44:26	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
Judah	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
my	1
great	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
named	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
liveth.	1
	1
44:27	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
watch	1
over	1
them	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
until	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
44:28	1
Yet	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
that	1
escape	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
return	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there,	1
shall	1
know	1
whose	1
words	1
shall	1
stand,	1
mine,	1
or	1
their's.	1
	1
44:29	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
surely	1
stand	1
against	1
you	1
for	1
evil:	1
44:30	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
Pharaohhophra	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
his	1
life;	1
as	1
I	1
gave	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
his	1
enemy,	1
and	1
that	1
sought	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
45:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
spake	1
unto	1
Baruch	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
45:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Baruch:	1
45:3	1
Thou	1
didst	1
say,	1
Woe	1
is	1
me	1
now!	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
added	1
grief	1
to	1
my	1
sorrow;	1
I	1
fainted	1
in	1
my	1
sighing,	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
45:4	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
saith	1
thus;	1
Behold,	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
down,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
planted	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
up,	1
even	1
this	1
whole	1
land.	1
	1
45:5	1
And	1
seekest	1
thou	1
great	1
things	1
for	1
thyself?	1
seek	1
them	1
not:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
thy	1
life	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
46:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
against	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
46:2	1
Against	1
Egypt,	1
against	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Pharaohnecho	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates	1
in	1
Carchemish,	1
which	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
smote	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
46:3	1
Order	1
ye	1
the	1
buckler	1
and	1
shield,	1
and	1
draw	1
near	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
46:4	1
Harness	1
the	1
horses;	1
and	1
get	1
up,	1
ye	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
stand	1
forth	1
with	1
your	1
helmets;	1
furbish	1
the	1
spears,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
brigandines.	1
	1
46:5	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
them	1
dismayed	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
back?	1
and	1
their	1
mighty	1
ones	1
are	1
beaten	1
down,	1
and	1
are	1
fled	1
apace,	1
and	1
look	1
not	1
back:	1
for	1
fear	1
was	1
round	1
about,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
46:6	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
swift	1
flee	1
away,	1
nor	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
escape;	1
they	1
shall	1
stumble,	1
and	1
fall	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
46:7	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
cometh	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
flood,	1
whose	1
waters	1
are	1
moved	1
as	1
the	1
rivers?	1
	1
46:8	1
Egypt	1
riseth	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
flood,	1
and	1
his	1
waters	1
are	1
moved	1
like	1
the	1
rivers;	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up,	1
and	1
will	1
cover	1
the	1
earth;	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof.	1
	1
46:9	1
Come	1
up,	1
ye	1
horses;	1
and	1
rage,	1
ye	1
chariots;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
come	1
forth;	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
and	1
the	1
Libyans,	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
shield;	1
and	1
the	1
Lydians,	1
that	1
handle	1
and	1
bend	1
the	1
bow.	1
	1
46:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
vengeance,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
avenge	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
adversaries:	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
satiate	1
and	1
made	1
drunk	1
with	1
their	1
blood:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
country	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
46:11	1
Go	1
up	1
into	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
take	1
balm,	1
O	1
virgin,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
in	1
vain	1
shalt	1
thou	1
use	1
many	1
medicines;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
cured.	1
	1
46:12	1
The	1
nations	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
thy	1
shame,	1
and	1
thy	1
cry	1
hath	1
filled	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
hath	1
stumbled	1
against	1
the	1
mighty,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
fallen	1
both	1
together.	1
	1
46:13	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
how	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
46:14	1
Declare	1
ye	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
publish	1
in	1
Migdol,	1
and	1
publish	1
in	1
Noph	1
and	1
in	1
Tahpanhes:	1
say	1
ye,	1
Stand	1
fast,	1
and	1
prepare	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour	1
round	1
about	1
thee.	1
	1
46:15	1
Why	1
are	1
thy	1
valiant	1
men	1
swept	1
away?	1
they	1
stood	1
not,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
drive	1
them.	1
	1
46:16	1
He	1
made	1
many	1
to	1
fall,	1
yea,	1
one	1
fell	1
upon	1
another:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
our	1
nativity,	1
from	1
the	1
oppressing	1
sword.	1
	1
46:17	1
They	1
did	1
cry	1
there,	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
noise;	1
he	1
hath	1
passed	1
the	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
46:18	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
King,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
Surely	1
as	1
Tabor	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
as	1
Carmel	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
come.	1
	1
46:19	1
O	1
thou	1
daughter	1
dwelling	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
furnish	1
thyself	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
for	1
Noph	1
shall	1
be	1
waste	1
and	1
desolate	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
46:20	1
Egypt	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
fair	1
heifer,	1
but	1
destruction	1
cometh;	1
it	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
46:21	1
Also	1
her	1
hired	1
men	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
like	1
fatted	1
bullocks;	1
for	1
they	1
also	1
are	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
are	1
fled	1
away	1
together:	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
stand,	1
because	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity	1
was	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation.	1
	1
46:22	1
The	1
voice	1
thereof	1
shall	1
go	1
like	1
a	1
serpent;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
march	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
come	1
against	1
her	1
with	1
axes,	1
as	1
hewers	1
of	1
wood.	1
	1
46:23	1
They	1
shall	1
cut	1
down	1
her	1
forest,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
though	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
searched;	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
grasshoppers,	1
and	1
are	1
innumerable.	1
	1
46:24	1
The	1
daughter	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded;	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
46:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
No,	1
and	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
with	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
their	1
kings;	1
even	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him:	1
46:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
afterward	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
46:27	1
But	1
fear	1
not	1
thou,	1
O	1
my	1
servant	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
from	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
captivity;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
rest	1
and	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
afraid.	1
	1
46:28	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not,	1
O	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whither	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
correct	1
thee	1
in	1
measure;	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
leave	1
thee	1
wholly	1
unpunished.	1
	1
47:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
before	1
that	1
Pharaoh	1
smote	1
Gaza.	1
	1
47:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
waters	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
overflowing	1
flood,	1
and	1
shall	1
overflow	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein;	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
then	1
the	1
men	1
shall	1
cry,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
howl.	1
	1
47:3	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
stamping	1
of	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
horses,	1
at	1
the	1
rushing	1
of	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
rumbling	1
of	1
his	1
wheels,	1
the	1
fathers	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
children	1
for	1
feebleness	1
of	1
hands;	1
47:4	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
spoil	1
all	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Tyrus	1
and	1
Zidon	1
every	1
helper	1
that	1
remaineth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
spoil	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Caphtor.	1
	1
47:5	1
Baldness	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
Gaza;	1
Ashkelon	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
their	1
valley:	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
cut	1
thyself?	1
	1
47:6	1
O	1
thou	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
thou	1
be	1
quiet?	1
put	1
up	1
thyself	1
into	1
thy	1
scabbard,	1
rest,	1
and	1
be	1
still.	1
	1
47:7	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
quiet,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
a	1
charge	1
against	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
sea	1
shore?	1
there	1
hath	1
he	1
appointed	1
it.	1
	1
48:1	1
Against	1
Moab	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Woe	1
unto	1
Nebo!	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
Kiriathaim	1
is	1
confounded	1
and	1
taken:	1
Misgab	1
is	1
confounded	1
and	1
dismayed.	1
	1
48:2	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
praise	1
of	1
Moab:	1
in	1
Heshbon	1
they	1
have	1
devised	1
evil	1
against	1
it;	1
come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cut	1
it	1
off	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
nation.	1
Also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
O	1
Madmen;	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
pursue	1
thee.	1
	1
48:3	1
A	1
voice	1
of	1
crying	1
shall	1
be	1
from	1
Horonaim,	1
spoiling	1
and	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
48:4	1
Moab	1
is	1
destroyed;	1
her	1
little	1
ones	1
have	1
caused	1
a	1
cry	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
48:5	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
going	1
up	1
of	1
Luhith	1
continual	1
weeping	1
shall	1
go	1
up;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
Horonaim	1
the	1
enemies	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
destruction.	1
	1
48:6	1
Flee,	1
save	1
your	1
lives,	1
and	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
heath	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
48:7	1
For	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
trusted	1
in	1
thy	1
works	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
treasures,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
be	1
taken:	1
and	1
Chemosh	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
captivity	1
with	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
together.	1
	1
48:8	1
And	1
the	1
spoiler	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
every	1
city,	1
and	1
no	1
city	1
shall	1
escape:	1
the	1
valley	1
also	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
plain	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
48:9	1
Give	1
wings	1
unto	1
Moab,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
flee	1
and	1
get	1
away:	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
without	1
any	1
to	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
48:10	1
Cursed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
deceitfully,	1
and	1
cursed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
back	1
his	1
sword	1
from	1
blood.	1
	1
48:11	1
Moab	1
hath	1
been	1
at	1
ease	1
from	1
his	1
youth,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
settled	1
on	1
his	1
lees,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
emptied	1
from	1
vessel	1
to	1
vessel,	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity:	1
therefore	1
his	1
taste	1
remained	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
scent	1
is	1
not	1
changed.	1
	1
48:12	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
him	1
wanderers,	1
that	1
shall	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
wander,	1
and	1
shall	1
empty	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
break	1
their	1
bottles.	1
	1
48:13	1
And	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Chemosh,	1
as	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
ashamed	1
of	1
Bethel	1
their	1
confidence.	1
	1
48:14	1
How	1
say	1
ye,	1
We	1
are	1
mighty	1
and	1
strong	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
war?	1
	1
48:15	1
Moab	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
gone	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
cities,	1
and	1
his	1
chosen	1
young	1
men	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
saith	1
the	1
King,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
48:16	1
The	1
calamity	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
his	1
affliction	1
hasteth	1
fast.	1
	1
48:17	1
All	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
him,	1
bemoan	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
know	1
his	1
name,	1
say,	1
How	1
is	1
the	1
strong	1
staff	1
broken,	1
and	1
the	1
beautiful	1
rod!	1
48:18	1
Thou	1
daughter	1
that	1
dost	1
inhabit	1
Dibon,	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
thy	1
glory,	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
thirst;	1
for	1
the	1
spoiler	1
of	1
Moab	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds.	1
	1
48:19	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Aroer,	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
espy;	1
ask	1
him	1
that	1
fleeth,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
escapeth,	1
and	1
say,	1
What	1
is	1
done?	1
	1
48:20	1
Moab	1
is	1
confounded;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
broken	1
down:	1
howl	1
and	1
cry;	1
tell	1
ye	1
it	1
in	1
Arnon,	1
that	1
Moab	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
48:21	1
And	1
judgment	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
plain	1
country;	1
upon	1
Holon,	1
and	1
upon	1
Jahazah,	1
and	1
upon	1
Mephaath,	1
48:22	1
And	1
upon	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
upon	1
Nebo,	1
and	1
upon	1
Bethdiblathaim,	1
48:23	1
And	1
upon	1
Kiriathaim,	1
and	1
upon	1
Bethgamul,	1
and	1
upon	1
Bethmeon,	1
48:24	1
And	1
upon	1
Kerioth,	1
and	1
upon	1
Bozrah,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
far	1
or	1
near.	1
	1
48:25	1
The	1
horn	1
of	1
Moab	1
is	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
is	1
broken,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
48:26	1
Make	1
ye	1
him	1
drunken:	1
for	1
he	1
magnified	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Moab	1
also	1
shall	1
wallow	1
in	1
his	1
vomit,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
derision.	1
	1
48:27	1
For	1
was	1
not	1
Israel	1
a	1
derision	1
unto	1
thee?	1
was	1
he	1
found	1
among	1
thieves?	1
	1
for	1
since	1
thou	1
spakest	1
of	1
him,	1
thou	1
skippedst	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
48:28	1
O	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Moab,	1
leave	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
dove	1
that	1
maketh	1
her	1
nest	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
hole's	1
mouth.	1
	1
48:29	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Moab,	1
(he	1
is	1
exceeding	1
proud)	1
his	1
loftiness,	1
and	1
his	1
arrogancy,	1
and	1
his	1
pride,	1
and	1
the	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
48:30	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
wrath,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so;	1
his	1
lies	1
shall	1
not	1
so	1
effect	1
it.	1
	1
48:31	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
howl	1
for	1
Moab,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cry	1
out	1
for	1
all	1
Moab;	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
mourn	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Kirheres.	1
	1
48:32	1
O	1
vine	1
of	1
Sibmah,	1
I	1
will	1
weep	1
for	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
weeping	1
of	1
Jazer:	1
thy	1
plants	1
are	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
reach	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Jazer:	1
the	1
spoiler	1
is	1
fallen	1
upon	1
thy	1
summer	1
fruits	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
vintage.	1
	1
48:33	1
And	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
plentiful	1
field,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
wine	1
to	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
winepresses:	1
none	1
shall	1
tread	1
with	1
shouting;	1
their	1
shouting	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
shouting.	1
	1
48:34	1
From	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
even	1
unto	1
Elealeh,	1
and	1
even	1
unto	1
Jahaz,	1
have	1
they	1
uttered	1
their	1
voice,	1
from	1
Zoar	1
even	1
unto	1
Horonaim,	1
as	1
an	1
heifer	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old:	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
also	1
of	1
Nimrim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
48:35	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
in	1
Moab,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
burneth	1
incense	1
to	1
his	1
gods.	1
	1
48:36	1
Therefore	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
sound	1
for	1
Moab	1
like	1
pipes,	1
and	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
sound	1
like	1
pipes	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Kirheres:	1
because	1
the	1
riches	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
gotten	1
are	1
perished.	1
	1
48:37	1
For	1
every	1
head	1
shall	1
be	1
bald,	1
and	1
every	1
beard	1
clipped:	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
cuttings,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
loins	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
48:38	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
lamentation	1
generally	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
housetops	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
thereof:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
Moab	1
like	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
48:39	1
They	1
shall	1
howl,	1
saying,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
broken	1
down!	1
how	1
hath	1
Moab	1
turned	1
the	1
back	1
with	1
shame!	1
so	1
shall	1
Moab	1
be	1
a	1
derision	1
and	1
a	1
dismaying	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
48:40	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
fly	1
as	1
an	1
eagle,	1
and	1
shall	1
spread	1
his	1
wings	1
over	1
Moab.	1
	1
48:41	1
Kerioth	1
is	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
holds	1
are	1
surprised,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men's	1
hearts	1
in	1
Moab	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
her	1
pangs.	1
	1
48:42	1
And	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
being	1
a	1
people,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
magnified	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
48:43	1
Fear,	1
and	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
snare,	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Moab,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
48:44	1
He	1
that	1
fleeth	1
from	1
the	1
fear	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
pit;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
getteth	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
snare:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
it,	1
even	1
upon	1
Moab,	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
visitation,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
48:45	1
They	1
that	1
fled	1
stood	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Heshbon	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
force:	1
but	1
a	1
fire	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
a	1
flame	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Sihon,	1
and	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
tumultuous	1
ones.	1
	1
48:46	1
Woe	1
be	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Moab!	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Chemosh	1
perisheth:	1
for	1
thy	1
sons	1
are	1
taken	1
captives,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
captives.	1
	1
48:47	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Moab	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Thus	1
far	1
is	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
49:1	1
Concerning	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Hath	1
Israel	1
no	1
sons?	1
	1
hath	1
he	1
no	1
heir?	1
why	1
then	1
doth	1
their	1
king	1
inherit	1
Gad,	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
dwell	1
in	1
his	1
cities?	1
	1
49:2	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
an	1
alarm	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
Rabbah	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolate	1
heap,	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
then	1
shall	1
Israel	1
be	1
heir	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
his	1
heirs,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:3	1
Howl,	1
O	1
Heshbon,	1
for	1
Ai	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
cry,	1
ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Rabbah,	1
gird	1
you	1
with	1
sackcloth;	1
lament,	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
by	1
the	1
hedges;	1
for	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
together.	1
	1
49:4	1
Wherefore	1
gloriest	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
valleys,	1
thy	1
flowing	1
valley,	1
O	1
backsliding	1
daughter?	1
that	1
trusted	1
in	1
her	1
treasures,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
49:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
fear	1
upon	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
about	1
thee;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
out	1
every	1
man	1
right	1
forth;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
gather	1
up	1
him	1
that	1
wandereth.	1
	1
49:6	1
And	1
afterward	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:7	1
Concerning	1
Edom,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Is	1
wisdom	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
Teman?	1
is	1
counsel	1
perished	1
from	1
the	1
prudent?	1
is	1
their	1
wisdom	1
vanished?	1
	1
49:8	1
Flee	1
ye,	1
turn	1
back,	1
dwell	1
deep,	1
O	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Dedan;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
calamity	1
of	1
Esau	1
upon	1
him,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
him.	1
	1
49:9	1
If	1
grapegatherers	1
come	1
to	1
thee,	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
leave	1
some	1
gleaning	1
grapes?	1
if	1
thieves	1
by	1
night,	1
they	1
will	1
destroy	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
enough.	1
	1
49:10	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
Esau	1
bare,	1
I	1
have	1
uncovered	1
his	1
secret	1
places,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hide	1
himself:	1
his	1
seed	1
is	1
spoiled,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
49:11	1
Leave	1
thy	1
fatherless	1
children,	1
I	1
will	1
preserve	1
them	1
alive;	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
widows	1
trust	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
49:12	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
they	1
whose	1
judgment	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
have	1
assuredly	1
drunken;	1
and	1
art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
altogether	1
go	1
unpunished?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
unpunished,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
drink	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
49:13	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
myself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
Bozrah	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
desolation,	1
a	1
reproach,	1
a	1
waste,	1
and	1
a	1
curse;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
perpetual	1
wastes.	1
	1
49:14	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
rumour	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
ambassador	1
is	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
saying,	1
Gather	1
ye	1
together,	1
and	1
come	1
against	1
her,	1
and	1
rise	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
49:15	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
small	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
despised	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
49:16	1
Thy	1
terribleness	1
hath	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
thine	1
heart,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
that	1
holdest	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
hill:	1
though	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
make	1
thy	1
nest	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
the	1
eagle,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
down	1
from	1
thence,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:17	1
Also	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
goeth	1
by	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
shall	1
hiss	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
plagues	1
thereof.	1
	1
49:18	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
overthrow	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
and	1
the	1
neighbour	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
abide	1
there,	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
dwell	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
49:19	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
lion	1
from	1
the	1
swelling	1
of	1
Jordan	1
against	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
the	1
strong:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
suddenly	1
make	1
him	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
her:	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
her?	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
me?	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
appoint	1
me	1
the	1
time?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
shepherd	1
that	1
will	1
stand	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
49:20	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
against	1
Edom;	1
and	1
his	1
purposes,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Teman:	1
Surely	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
draw	1
them	1
out:	1
surely	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
their	1
habitations	1
desolate	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
49:21	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
moved	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
their	1
fall,	1
at	1
the	1
cry	1
the	1
noise	1
thereof	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
49:22	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
fly	1
as	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
spread	1
his	1
wings	1
over	1
Bozrah:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
Edom	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
her	1
pangs.	1
	1
49:23	1
Concerning	1
Damascus.	1
Hamath	1
is	1
confounded,	1
and	1
Arpad:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
evil	1
tidings:	1
they	1
are	1
fainthearted;	1
there	1
is	1
sorrow	1
on	1
the	1
sea;	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
quiet.	1
	1
49:24	1
Damascus	1
is	1
waxed	1
feeble,	1
and	1
turneth	1
herself	1
to	1
flee,	1
and	1
fear	1
hath	1
seized	1
on	1
her:	1
anguish	1
and	1
sorrows	1
have	1
taken	1
her,	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
49:25	1
How	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
praise	1
not	1
left,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
joy!	1
	1
49:26	1
Therefore	1
her	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
her	1
streets,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
49:27	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Benhadad.	1
	1
49:28	1
Concerning	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
Hazor,	1
which	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
smite,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
spoil	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
49:29	1
Their	1
tents	1
and	1
their	1
flocks	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
away:	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
to	1
themselves	1
their	1
curtains,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
vessels,	1
and	1
their	1
camels;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
is	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
49:30	1
Flee,	1
get	1
you	1
far	1
off,	1
dwell	1
deep,	1
O	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Hazor,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
taken	1
counsel	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
hath	1
conceived	1
a	1
purpose	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
49:31	1
Arise,	1
get	1
you	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
wealthy	1
nation,	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
without	1
care,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
have	1
neither	1
gates	1
nor	1
bars,	1
which	1
dwell	1
alone.	1
	1
49:32	1
And	1
their	1
camels	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
booty,	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
their	1
cattle	1
a	1
spoil:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
into	1
all	1
winds	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
corners;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
their	1
calamity	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:33	1
And	1
Hazor	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
dwelling	1
for	1
dragons,	1
and	1
a	1
desolation	1
for	1
ever:	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
abide	1
there,	1
nor	1
any	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
dwell	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
49:34	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
against	1
Elam	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
49:35	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Elam,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
their	1
might.	1
	1
49:36	1
And	1
upon	1
Elam	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
will	1
scatter	1
them	1
toward	1
all	1
those	1
winds;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
nation	1
whither	1
the	1
outcasts	1
of	1
Elam	1
shall	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
49:37	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
Elam	1
to	1
be	1
dismayed	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
before	1
them	1
that	1
seek	1
their	1
life:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
them,	1
even	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
sword	1
after	1
them,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them:	1
49:38	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
throne	1
in	1
Elam,	1
and	1
will	1
destroy	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:39	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Elam,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
50:1	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
against	1
Babylon	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
by	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
50:2	1
Declare	1
ye	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
publish,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
standard;	1
publish,	1
and	1
conceal	1
not:	1
say,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
taken,	1
Bel	1
is	1
confounded,	1
Merodach	1
is	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces;	1
her	1
idols	1
are	1
confounded,	1
her	1
images	1
are	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
50:3	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
there	1
cometh	1
up	1
a	1
nation	1
against	1
her,	1
which	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
land	1
desolate,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
they	1
shall	1
remove,	1
they	1
shall	1
depart,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast.	1
	1
50:4	1
In	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
come,	1
they	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
together,	1
going	1
and	1
weeping:	1
they	1
shall	1
go,	1
and	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
50:5	1
They	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Zion	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
thitherward,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
join	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
covenant	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
	1
50:6	1
My	1
people	1
hath	1
been	1
lost	1
sheep:	1
their	1
shepherds	1
have	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
astray,	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
them	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
mountains:	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
from	1
mountain	1
to	1
hill,	1
they	1
have	1
forgotten	1
their	1
restingplace.	1
	1
50:7	1
All	1
that	1
found	1
them	1
have	1
devoured	1
them:	1
and	1
their	1
adversaries	1
said,	1
We	1
offend	1
not,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
justice,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
50:8	1
Remove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
he	1
goats	1
before	1
the	1
flocks.	1
	1
50:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
and	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
Babylon	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
great	1
nations	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
country:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
her;	1
from	1
thence	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
taken:	1
their	1
arrows	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
expert	1
man;	1
none	1
shall	1
return	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
50:10	1
And	1
Chaldea	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil:	1
all	1
that	1
spoil	1
her	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
50:11	1
Because	1
ye	1
were	1
glad,	1
because	1
ye	1
rejoiced,	1
O	1
ye	1
destroyers	1
of	1
mine	1
heritage,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
grown	1
fat	1
as	1
the	1
heifer	1
at	1
grass,	1
and	1
bellow	1
as	1
bulls;	1
50:12	1
Your	1
mother	1
shall	1
be	1
sore	1
confounded;	1
she	1
that	1
bare	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
behold,	1
the	1
hindermost	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
a	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
a	1
desert.	1
	1
50:13	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
desolate:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
goeth	1
by	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
hiss	1
at	1
all	1
her	1
plagues.	1
	1
50:14	1
Put	1
yourselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
Babylon	1
round	1
about:	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
bend	1
the	1
bow,	1
shoot	1
at	1
her,	1
spare	1
no	1
arrows:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
50:15	1
Shout	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about:	1
she	1
hath	1
given	1
her	1
hand:	1
her	1
foundations	1
are	1
fallen,	1
her	1
walls	1
are	1
thrown	1
down:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
take	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
her;	1
as	1
she	1
hath	1
done,	1
do	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
50:16	1
Cut	1
off	1
the	1
sower	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
handleth	1
the	1
sickle	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest:	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
oppressing	1
sword	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
50:17	1
Israel	1
is	1
a	1
scattered	1
sheep;	1
the	1
lions	1
have	1
driven	1
him	1
away:	1
first	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
hath	1
devoured	1
him;	1
and	1
last	1
this	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
broken	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
50:18	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
and	1
his	1
land,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
punished	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
50:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
Israel	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
habitation,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
feed	1
on	1
Carmel	1
and	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
upon	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Gilead.	1
	1
50:20	1
In	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
time,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
sought	1
for,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none;	1
and	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pardon	1
them	1
whom	1
I	1
reserve.	1
	1
50:21	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Merathaim,	1
even	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Pekod:	1
waste	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
after	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
50:22	1
A	1
sound	1
of	1
battle	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
destruction.	1
	1
50:23	1
How	1
is	1
the	1
hammer	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
cut	1
asunder	1
and	1
broken!	1
how	1
is	1
Babylon	1
become	1
a	1
desolation	1
among	1
the	1
nations!	1
	1
50:24	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
also	1
taken,	1
O	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
aware:	1
thou	1
art	1
found,	1
and	1
also	1
caught,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
striven	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
50:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
opened	1
his	1
armoury,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
his	1
indignation:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
50:26	1
Come	1
against	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
utmost	1
border,	1
open	1
her	1
storehouses:	1
cast	1
her	1
up	1
as	1
heaps,	1
and	1
destroy	1
her	1
utterly:	1
let	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
be	1
left.	1
	1
50:27	1
Slay	1
all	1
her	1
bullocks;	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter:	1
woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
their	1
day	1
is	1
come,	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation.	1
	1
50:28	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
flee	1
and	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
to	1
declare	1
in	1
Zion	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
his	1
temple.	1
	1
50:29	1
Call	1
together	1
the	1
archers	1
against	1
Babylon:	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
bend	1
the	1
bow,	1
camp	1
against	1
it	1
round	1
about;	1
let	1
none	1
thereof	1
escape:	1
recompense	1
her	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
work;	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
done,	1
do	1
unto	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
proud	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
50:30	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
her	1
young	1
men	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
50:31	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
most	1
proud,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
for	1
thy	1
day	1
is	1
come,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
thee.	1
	1
50:32	1
And	1
the	1
most	1
proud	1
shall	1
stumble	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
50:33	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
oppressed	1
together:	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
took	1
them	1
captives	1
held	1
them	1
fast;	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
50:34	1
Their	1
Redeemer	1
is	1
strong;	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
he	1
shall	1
throughly	1
plead	1
their	1
cause,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
disquiet	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
50:35	1
A	1
sword	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
princes,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
wise	1
men.	1
	1
50:36	1
A	1
sword	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
liars;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dote:	1
a	1
sword	1
is	1
upon	1
her	1
mighty	1
men;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
dismayed.	1
	1
50:37	1
A	1
sword	1
is	1
upon	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
mingled	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
as	1
women:	1
a	1
sword	1
is	1
upon	1
her	1
treasures;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
robbed.	1
	1
50:38	1
A	1
drought	1
is	1
upon	1
her	1
waters;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
dried	1
up:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
graven	1
images,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
mad	1
upon	1
their	1
idols.	1
	1
50:39	1
Therefore	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
islands	1
shall	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
owls	1
shall	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
inhabited	1
for	1
ever;	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
dwelt	1
in	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
50:40	1
As	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
and	1
the	1
neighbour	1
cities	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
so	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
abide	1
there,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
50:41	1
Behold,	1
a	1
people	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
nation,	1
and	1
many	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
50:42	1
They	1
shall	1
hold	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
lance:	1
they	1
are	1
cruel,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
shew	1
mercy:	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses,	1
every	1
one	1
put	1
in	1
array,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
battle,	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
50:43	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
waxed	1
feeble:	1
anguish	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
pangs	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
50:44	1
Behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
lion	1
from	1
the	1
swelling	1
of	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
the	1
strong:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
suddenly	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
her:	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
man,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
her?	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
me?	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
appoint	1
me	1
the	1
time?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
shepherd	1
that	1
will	1
stand	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
50:45	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
against	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
his	1
purposes,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
Surely	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
draw	1
them	1
out:	1
surely	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
their	1
habitation	1
desolate	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
50:46	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
taking	1
of	1
Babylon	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
is	1
heard	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
51:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
against	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
a	1
destroying	1
wind;	1
51:2	1
And	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
Babylon	1
fanners,	1
that	1
shall	1
fan	1
her,	1
and	1
shall	1
empty	1
her	1
land:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
her	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
51:3	1
Against	1
him	1
that	1
bendeth	1
let	1
the	1
archer	1
bend	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
lifteth	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
brigandine:	1
and	1
spare	1
ye	1
not	1
her	1
young	1
men;	1
destroy	1
ye	1
utterly	1
all	1
her	1
host.	1
	1
51:4	1
Thus	1
the	1
slain	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
thrust	1
through	1
in	1
her	1
streets.	1
	1
51:5	1
For	1
Israel	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
forsaken,	1
nor	1
Judah	1
of	1
his	1
God,	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
though	1
their	1
land	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
51:6	1
Flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
deliver	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
soul:	1
be	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
her	1
iniquity;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
vengeance;	1
he	1
will	1
render	1
unto	1
her	1
a	1
recompence.	1
	1
51:7	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
golden	1
cup	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand,	1
that	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
drunken:	1
the	1
nations	1
have	1
drunken	1
of	1
her	1
wine;	1
therefore	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
mad.	1
	1
51:8	1
Babylon	1
is	1
suddenly	1
fallen	1
and	1
destroyed:	1
howl	1
for	1
her;	1
take	1
balm	1
for	1
her	1
pain,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
51:9	1
We	1
would	1
have	1
healed	1
Babylon,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
healed:	1
forsake	1
her,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country:	1
for	1
her	1
judgment	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
skies.	1
	1
51:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth	1
our	1
righteousness:	1
come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
declare	1
in	1
Zion	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
51:11	1
Make	1
bright	1
the	1
arrows;	1
gather	1
the	1
shields:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Medes:	1
for	1
his	1
device	1
is	1
against	1
Babylon,	1
to	1
destroy	1
it;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
his	1
temple.	1
	1
51:12	1
Set	1
up	1
the	1
standard	1
upon	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
make	1
the	1
watch	1
strong,	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
watchmen,	1
prepare	1
the	1
ambushes:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
both	1
devised	1
and	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
51:13	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
upon	1
many	1
waters,	1
abundant	1
in	1
treasures,	1
thine	1
end	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
thy	1
covetousness.	1
	1
51:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
thee	1
with	1
men,	1
as	1
with	1
caterpillers;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
shout	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
51:15	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
his	1
power,	1
he	1
hath	1
established	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
hath	1
stretched	1
out	1
the	1
heaven	1
by	1
his	1
understanding.	1
	1
51:16	1
When	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
voice,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
and	1
he	1
causeth	1
the	1
vapours	1
to	1
ascend	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
maketh	1
lightnings	1
with	1
rain,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
the	1
wind	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasures.	1
	1
51:17	1
Every	1
man	1
is	1
brutish	1
by	1
his	1
knowledge;	1
every	1
founder	1
is	1
confounded	1
by	1
the	1
graven	1
image:	1
for	1
his	1
molten	1
image	1
is	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
51:18	1
They	1
are	1
vanity,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
errors:	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
visitation	1
they	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
51:19	1
The	1
portion	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
them;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
all	1
things:	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance:	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
51:20	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
battle	1
axe	1
and	1
weapons	1
of	1
war:	1
for	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
kingdoms;	1
51:21	1
And	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider;	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
chariot	1
and	1
his	1
rider;	1
51:22	1
With	1
thee	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
man	1
and	1
woman;	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
old	1
and	1
young;	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
maid;	1
51:23	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
with	1
thee	1
the	1
shepherd	1
and	1
his	1
flock;	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
husbandman	1
and	1
his	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen;	1
and	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
captains	1
and	1
rulers.	1
	1
51:24	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
unto	1
Babylon	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Chaldea	1
all	1
their	1
evil	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
Zion	1
in	1
your	1
sight,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:25	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
destroying	1
mountain,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
destroyest	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
roll	1
thee	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
rocks,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
burnt	1
mountain.	1
	1
51:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
stone	1
for	1
a	1
corner,	1
nor	1
a	1
stone	1
for	1
foundations;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
desolate	1
for	1
ever,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:27	1
Set	1
ye	1
up	1
a	1
standard	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
prepare	1
the	1
nations	1
against	1
her,	1
call	1
together	1
against	1
her	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
Ararat,	1
Minni,	1
and	1
Ashchenaz;	1
appoint	1
a	1
captain	1
against	1
her;	1
cause	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
rough	1
caterpillers.	1
	1
51:28	1
Prepare	1
against	1
her	1
the	1
nations	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
the	1
captains	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
dominion.	1
	1
51:29	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
tremble	1
and	1
sorrow:	1
for	1
every	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
performed	1
against	1
Babylon,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Babylon	1
a	1
desolation	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
51:30	1
The	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon	1
have	1
forborn	1
to	1
fight,	1
they	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
their	1
holds:	1
their	1
might	1
hath	1
failed;	1
they	1
became	1
as	1
women:	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
her	1
dwellingplaces;	1
her	1
bars	1
are	1
broken.	1
	1
51:31	1
One	1
post	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
meet	1
another,	1
and	1
one	1
messenger	1
to	1
meet	1
another,	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
that	1
his	1
city	1
is	1
taken	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
51:32	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
passages	1
are	1
stopped,	1
and	1
the	1
reeds	1
they	1
have	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
affrighted.	1
	1
51:33	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
The	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
threshingfloor,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
thresh	1
her:	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
harvest	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
51:34	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
devoured	1
me,	1
he	1
hath	1
crushed	1
me,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
empty	1
vessel,	1
he	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
me	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
dragon,	1
he	1
hath	1
filled	1
his	1
belly	1
with	1
my	1
delicates,	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
me	1
out.	1
	1
51:35	1
The	1
violence	1
done	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
flesh	1
be	1
upon	1
Babylon,	1
shall	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zion	1
say;	1
and	1
my	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Chaldea,	1
shall	1
Jerusalem	1
say.	1
	1
51:36	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
plead	1
thy	1
cause,	1
and	1
take	1
vengeance	1
for	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dry	1
up	1
her	1
sea,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
springs	1
dry.	1
	1
51:37	1
And	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
a	1
dwellingplace	1
for	1
dragons,	1
an	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
an	1
hissing,	1
without	1
an	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
51:38	1
They	1
shall	1
roar	1
together	1
like	1
lions:	1
they	1
shall	1
yell	1
as	1
lions'	1
whelps.	1
	1
51:39	1
In	1
their	1
heat	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
their	1
feasts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
drunken,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
sleep	1
a	1
perpetual	1
sleep,	1
and	1
not	1
wake,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:40	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
like	1
lambs	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
like	1
rams	1
with	1
he	1
goats.	1
	1
51:41	1
How	1
is	1
Sheshach	1
taken!	1
and	1
how	1
is	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
surprised!	1
how	1
is	1
Babylon	1
become	1
an	1
astonishment	1
among	1
the	1
nations!	1
51:42	1
The	1
sea	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
Babylon:	1
she	1
is	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
thereof.	1
	1
51:43	1
Her	1
cities	1
are	1
a	1
desolation,	1
a	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
a	1
land	1
wherein	1
no	1
man	1
dwelleth,	1
neither	1
doth	1
any	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
pass	1
thereby.	1
	1
51:44	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
Bel	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
up:	1
and	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
not	1
flow	1
together	1
any	1
more	1
unto	1
him:	1
yea,	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
51:45	1
My	1
people,	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
deliver	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
soul	1
from	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:46	1
And	1
lest	1
your	1
heart	1
faint,	1
and	1
ye	1
fear	1
for	1
the	1
rumour	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
land;	1
a	1
rumour	1
shall	1
both	1
come	1
one	1
year,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
in	1
another	1
year	1
shall	1
come	1
a	1
rumour,	1
and	1
violence	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
ruler	1
against	1
ruler.	1
	1
51:47	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
judgment	1
upon	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
and	1
her	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
slain	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
51:48	1
Then	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
shall	1
sing	1
for	1
Babylon:	1
for	1
the	1
spoilers	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:49	1
As	1
Babylon	1
hath	1
caused	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
fall,	1
so	1
at	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
fall	1
the	1
slain	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
51:50	1
Ye	1
that	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
sword,	1
go	1
away,	1
stand	1
not	1
still:	1
remember	1
the	1
LORD	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
let	1
Jerusalem	1
come	1
into	1
your	1
mind.	1
	1
51:51	1
We	1
are	1
confounded,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
reproach:	1
shame	1
hath	1
covered	1
our	1
faces:	1
for	1
strangers	1
are	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuaries	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house.	1
	1
51:52	1
Wherefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
judgment	1
upon	1
her	1
graven	1
images:	1
and	1
through	1
all	1
her	1
land	1
the	1
wounded	1
shall	1
groan.	1
	1
51:53	1
Though	1
Babylon	1
should	1
mount	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
should	1
fortify	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
her	1
strength,	1
yet	1
from	1
me	1
shall	1
spoilers	1
come	1
unto	1
her,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
51:54	1
A	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
cry	1
cometh	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
great	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans:	1
51:55	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
the	1
great	1
voice;	1
when	1
her	1
waves	1
do	1
roar	1
like	1
great	1
waters,	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
their	1
voice	1
is	1
uttered:	1
51:56	1
Because	1
the	1
spoiler	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
her,	1
even	1
upon	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
her	1
mighty	1
men	1
are	1
taken,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
bows	1
is	1
broken:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
recompences	1
shall	1
surely	1
requite.	1
	1
51:57	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
drunk	1
her	1
princes,	1
and	1
her	1
wise	1
men,	1
her	1
captains,	1
and	1
her	1
rulers,	1
and	1
her	1
mighty	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sleep	1
a	1
perpetual	1
sleep,	1
and	1
not	1
wake,	1
saith	1
the	1
King,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
51:58	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
The	1
broad	1
walls	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
broken,	1
and	1
her	1
high	1
gates	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
labour	1
in	1
vain,	1
and	1
the	1
folk	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
weary.	1
	1
51:59	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
commanded	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Neriah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maaseiah,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
Babylon	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
And	1
this	1
Seraiah	1
was	1
a	1
quiet	1
prince.	1
	1
51:60	1
So	1
Jeremiah	1
wrote	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
Babylon,	1
even	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
against	1
Babylon.	1
	1
51:61	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
said	1
to	1
Seraiah,	1
When	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
shalt	1
see,	1
and	1
shalt	1
read	1
all	1
these	1
words;	1
51:62	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
against	1
this	1
place,	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
off,	1
that	1
none	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
it,	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
beast,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
51:63	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
reading	1
this	1
book,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
a	1
stone	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Euphrates:	1
51:64	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
Babylon	1
sink,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
her:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
weary.	1
Thus	1
far	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jeremiah.	1
	1
52:1	1
Zedekiah	1
was	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eleven	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Hamutal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
of	1
Libnah.	1
	1
52:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Jehoiakim	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
52:3	1
For	1
through	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
Judah,	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
presence,	1
that	1
Zedekiah	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
52:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army,	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
pitched	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
built	1
forts	1
against	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
52:5	1
So	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
besieged	1
unto	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Zedekiah.	1
	1
52:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
52:7	1
Then	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
walls,	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
garden;	1
(now	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
city	1
round	1
about:)	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
plain.	1
	1
52:8	1
But	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
overtook	1
Zedekiah	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Jericho;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army	1
was	1
scattered	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
52:9	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Riblah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hamath;	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
judgment	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
52:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
slew	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
before	1
his	1
eyes:	1
he	1
slew	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
Riblah.	1
	1
52:11	1
Then	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Zedekiah;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
chains,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
52:12	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
came	1
Nebuzaradan,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
which	1
served	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
52:13	1
And	1
burned	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
house;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
burned	1
he	1
with	1
fire:	1
52:14	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
brake	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
52:15	1
Then	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
fell	1
away,	1
that	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
52:16	1
But	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
left	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
vinedressers	1
and	1
for	1
husbandmen.	1
	1
52:17	1
Also	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
brass	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
bases,	1
and	1
the	1
brasen	1
sea	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
brake,	1
and	1
carried	1
all	1
the	1
brass	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
52:18	1
The	1
caldrons	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
snuffers,	1
and	1
the	1
bowls,	1
and	1
the	1
spoons,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass	1
wherewith	1
they	1
ministered,	1
took	1
they	1
away.	1
	1
52:19	1
And	1
the	1
basons,	1
and	1
the	1
firepans,	1
and	1
the	1
bowls,	1
and	1
the	1
caldrons,	1
and	1
the	1
candlesticks,	1
and	1
the	1
spoons,	1
and	1
the	1
cups;	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
silver,	1
took	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
away.	1
	1
52:20	1
The	1
two	1
pillars,	1
one	1
sea,	1
and	1
twelve	1
brasen	1
bulls	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
bases,	1
which	1
king	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
brass	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
vessels	1
was	1
without	1
weight.	1
	1
52:21	1
And	1
concerning	1
the	1
pillars,	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
one	1
pillar	1
was	1
eighteen	1
cubits;	1
and	1
a	1
fillet	1
of	1
twelve	1
cubits	1
did	1
compass	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
thickness	1
thereof	1
was	1
four	1
fingers:	1
it	1
was	1
hollow.	1
	1
52:22	1
And	1
a	1
chapiter	1
of	1
brass	1
was	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
one	1
chapiter	1
was	1
five	1
cubits,	1
with	1
network	1
and	1
pomegranates	1
upon	1
the	1
chapiters	1
round	1
about,	1
all	1
of	1
brass.	1
The	1
second	1
pillar	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
these.	1
	1
52:23	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
ninety	1
and	1
six	1
pomegranates	1
on	1
a	1
side;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
upon	1
the	1
network	1
were	1
an	1
hundred	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
52:24	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
chief	1
priest,	1
and	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
second	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
door:	1
52:25	1
He	1
took	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
an	1
eunuch,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
near	1
the	1
king's	1
person,	1
which	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
scribe	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
who	1
mustered	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
threescore	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
52:26	1
So	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Riblah.	1
	1
52:27	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
Riblah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hamath.	1
Thus	1
Judah	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
52:28	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
people	1
whom	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
carried	1
away	1
captive:	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
three	1
thousand	1
Jews	1
and	1
three	1
and	1
twenty:	1
52:29	1
In	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
eight	1
hundred	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
persons:	1
52:30	1
In	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
seven	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
five	1
persons:	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
were	1
four	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred.	1
	1
52:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jehoiachin	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
five	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
Evilmerodach	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Jehoiachin	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
prison.	1
	1
52:32	1
And	1
spake	1
kindly	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
throne	1
above	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
Babylon,	1
52:33	1
And	1
changed	1
his	1
prison	1
garments:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
continually	1
eat	1
bread	1
before	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
52:34	1
And	1
for	1
his	1
diet,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
diet	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
portion	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Lamentations	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
How	1
doth	1
the	1
city	1
sit	1
solitary,	1
that	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
people!	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
become	1
as	1
a	1
widow!	1
she	1
that	1
was	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
princess	1
among	1
the	1
provinces,	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
become	1
tributary!	1
	1
1:2	1
She	1
weepeth	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
her	1
tears	1
are	1
on	1
her	1
cheeks:	1
among	1
all	1
her	1
lovers	1
she	1
hath	1
none	1
to	1
comfort	1
her:	1
all	1
her	1
friends	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
her,	1
they	1
are	1
become	1
her	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:3	1
Judah	1
is	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
because	1
of	1
affliction,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
great	1
servitude:	1
she	1
dwelleth	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
she	1
findeth	1
no	1
rest:	1
all	1
her	1
persecutors	1
overtook	1
her	1
between	1
the	1
straits.	1
	1
1:4	1
The	1
ways	1
of	1
Zion	1
do	1
mourn,	1
because	1
none	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
solemn	1
feasts:	1
all	1
her	1
gates	1
are	1
desolate:	1
her	1
priests	1
sigh,	1
her	1
virgins	1
are	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
bitterness.	1
	1
1:5	1
Her	1
adversaries	1
are	1
the	1
chief,	1
her	1
enemies	1
prosper;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
afflicted	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
her	1
transgressions:	1
her	1
children	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
before	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
all	1
her	1
beauty	1
is	1
departed:	1
her	1
princes	1
are	1
become	1
like	1
harts	1
that	1
find	1
no	1
pasture,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
without	1
strength	1
before	1
the	1
pursuer.	1
	1
1:7	1
Jerusalem	1
remembered	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
affliction	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
miseries	1
all	1
her	1
pleasant	1
things	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
when	1
her	1
people	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
none	1
did	1
help	1
her:	1
the	1
adversaries	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
did	1
mock	1
at	1
her	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
1:8	1
Jerusalem	1
hath	1
grievously	1
sinned;	1
therefore	1
she	1
is	1
removed:	1
all	1
that	1
honoured	1
her	1
despise	1
her,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
nakedness:	1
yea,	1
she	1
sigheth,	1
and	1
turneth	1
backward.	1
	1
1:9	1
Her	1
filthiness	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
skirts;	1
she	1
remembereth	1
not	1
her	1
last	1
end;	1
therefore	1
she	1
came	1
down	1
wonderfully:	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
comforter.	1
O	1
LORD,	1
behold	1
my	1
affliction:	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
hath	1
magnified	1
himself.	1
	1
1:10	1
The	1
adversary	1
hath	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
all	1
her	1
pleasant	1
things:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
heathen	1
entered	1
into	1
her	1
sanctuary,	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
command	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
thy	1
congregation.	1
	1
1:11	1
All	1
her	1
people	1
sigh,	1
they	1
seek	1
bread;	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
their	1
pleasant	1
things	1
for	1
meat	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
soul:	1
see,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consider;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
vile.	1
	1
1:12	1
Is	1
it	1
nothing	1
to	1
you,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
pass	1
by?	1
behold,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
sorrow	1
like	1
unto	1
my	1
sorrow,	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
unto	1
me,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
afflicted	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger.	1
	1
1:13	1
From	1
above	1
hath	1
he	1
sent	1
fire	1
into	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
it	1
prevaileth	1
against	1
them:	1
he	1
hath	1
spread	1
a	1
net	1
for	1
my	1
feet,	1
he	1
hath	1
turned	1
me	1
back:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
desolate	1
and	1
faint	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
1:14	1
The	1
yoke	1
of	1
my	1
transgressions	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
his	1
hand:	1
they	1
are	1
wreathed,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
my	1
neck:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
my	1
strength	1
to	1
fall,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
into	1
their	1
hands,	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
rise	1
up.	1
	1
1:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
all	1
my	1
mighty	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
me:	1
he	1
hath	1
called	1
an	1
assembly	1
against	1
me	1
to	1
crush	1
my	1
young	1
men:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
trodden	1
the	1
virgin,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Judah,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
winepress.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
weep;	1
mine	1
eye,	1
mine	1
eye	1
runneth	1
down	1
with	1
water,	1
because	1
the	1
comforter	1
that	1
should	1
relieve	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me:	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
desolate,	1
because	1
the	1
enemy	1
prevailed.	1
	1
1:17	1
Zion	1
spreadeth	1
forth	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
comfort	1
her:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
concerning	1
Jacob,	1
that	1
his	1
adversaries	1
should	1
be	1
round	1
about	1
him:	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
menstruous	1
woman	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
1:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
his	1
commandment:	1
hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
all	1
people,	1
and	1
behold	1
my	1
sorrow:	1
my	1
virgins	1
and	1
my	1
young	1
men	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
1:19	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
my	1
lovers,	1
but	1
they	1
deceived	1
me:	1
my	1
priests	1
and	1
mine	1
elders	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
while	1
they	1
sought	1
their	1
meat	1
to	1
relieve	1
their	1
souls.	1
	1
1:20	1
Behold,	1
O	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
distress:	1
my	1
bowels	1
are	1
troubled;	1
mine	1
heart	1
is	1
turned	1
within	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
grievously	1
rebelled:	1
abroad	1
the	1
sword	1
bereaveth,	1
at	1
home	1
there	1
is	1
as	1
death.	1
	1
1:21	1
They	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
sigh:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
comfort	1
me:	1
all	1
mine	1
enemies	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
trouble;	1
they	1
are	1
glad	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
it:	1
thou	1
wilt	1
bring	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
called,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
1:22	1
Let	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness	1
come	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
do	1
unto	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
all	1
my	1
transgressions:	1
for	1
my	1
sighs	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
faint.	1
	1
2:1	1
How	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
covered	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
with	1
a	1
cloud	1
in	1
his	1
anger,	1
and	1
cast	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
earth	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
remembered	1
not	1
his	1
footstool	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
anger!	1
	1
2:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
pitied:	1
he	1
hath	1
thrown	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
wrath	1
the	1
strong	1
holds	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Judah;	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground:	1
he	1
hath	1
polluted	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:3	1
He	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger	1
all	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
Israel:	1
he	1
hath	1
drawn	1
back	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
he	1
burned	1
against	1
Jacob	1
like	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire,	1
which	1
devoureth	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
hath	1
bent	1
his	1
bow	1
like	1
an	1
enemy:	1
he	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
as	1
an	1
adversary,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
fury	1
like	1
fire.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
LORD	1
was	1
as	1
an	1
enemy:	1
he	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
up	1
Israel,	1
he	1
hath	1
swallowed	1
up	1
all	1
her	1
palaces:	1
he	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
his	1
strong	1
holds,	1
and	1
hath	1
increased	1
in	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Judah	1
mourning	1
and	1
lamentation.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
violently	1
taken	1
away	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
garden:	1
he	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
his	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
assembly:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
caused	1
the	1
solemn	1
feasts	1
and	1
sabbaths	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
hath	1
despised	1
in	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
his	1
anger	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
2:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cast	1
off	1
his	1
altar,	1
he	1
hath	1
abhorred	1
his	1
sanctuary,	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
her	1
palaces;	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
a	1
solemn	1
feast.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
purposed	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
he	1
hath	1
stretched	1
out	1
a	1
line,	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
withdrawn	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
destroying:	1
therefore	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
rampart	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
lament;	1
they	1
languished	1
together.	1
	1
2:9	1
Her	1
gates	1
are	1
sunk	1
into	1
the	1
ground;	1
he	1
hath	1
destroyed	1
and	1
broken	1
her	1
bars:	1
her	1
king	1
and	1
her	1
princes	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
no	1
more;	1
her	1
prophets	1
also	1
find	1
no	1
vision	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
keep	1
silence:	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
up	1
dust	1
upon	1
their	1
heads;	1
they	1
have	1
girded	1
themselves	1
with	1
sackcloth:	1
the	1
virgins	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
hang	1
down	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
2:11	1
Mine	1
eyes	1
do	1
fail	1
with	1
tears,	1
my	1
bowels	1
are	1
troubled,	1
my	1
liver	1
is	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people;	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
and	1
the	1
sucklings	1
swoon	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
2:12	1
They	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
mothers,	1
Where	1
is	1
corn	1
and	1
wine?	1
when	1
they	1
swooned	1
as	1
the	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
their	1
soul	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
into	1
their	1
mothers'	1
bosom.	1
	1
2:13	1
What	1
thing	1
shall	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
witness	1
for	1
thee?	1
what	1
thing	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
to	1
thee,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem?	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
equal	1
to	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
comfort	1
thee,	1
O	1
virgin	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion?	1
for	1
thy	1
breach	1
is	1
great	1
like	1
the	1
sea:	1
who	1
can	1
heal	1
thee?	1
	1
2:14	1
Thy	1
prophets	1
have	1
seen	1
vain	1
and	1
foolish	1
things	1
for	1
thee:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
discovered	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
thy	1
captivity;	1
but	1
have	1
seen	1
for	1
thee	1
false	1
burdens	1
and	1
causes	1
of	1
banishment.	1
	1
2:15	1
All	1
that	1
pass	1
by	1
clap	1
their	1
hands	1
at	1
thee;	1
they	1
hiss	1
and	1
wag	1
their	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
men	1
call	1
The	1
perfection	1
of	1
beauty,	1
The	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth?	1
	1
2:16	1
All	1
thine	1
enemies	1
have	1
opened	1
their	1
mouth	1
against	1
thee:	1
they	1
hiss	1
and	1
gnash	1
the	1
teeth:	1
they	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
swallowed	1
her	1
up:	1
certainly	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
we	1
looked	1
for;	1
we	1
have	1
found,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it.	1
	1
2:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
devised;	1
he	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old:	1
he	1
hath	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
pitied:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
caused	1
thine	1
enemy	1
to	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee,	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
thine	1
adversaries.	1
	1
2:18	1
Their	1
heart	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
let	1
tears	1
run	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
river	1
day	1
and	1
night:	1
give	1
thyself	1
no	1
rest;	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
thine	1
eye	1
cease.	1
	1
2:19	1
Arise,	1
cry	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
night:	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
watches	1
pour	1
out	1
thine	1
heart	1
like	1
water	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
hands	1
toward	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thy	1
young	1
children,	1
that	1
faint	1
for	1
hunger	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
every	1
street.	1
	1
2:20	1
Behold,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consider	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this.	1
Shall	1
the	1
women	1
eat	1
their	1
fruit,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
span	1
long?	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
be	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
2:21	1
The	1
young	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
streets:	1
my	1
virgins	1
and	1
my	1
young	1
men	1
are	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
thou	1
hast	1
slain	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thine	1
anger;	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed,	1
and	1
not	1
pitied.	1
	1
2:22	1
Thou	1
hast	1
called	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
day	1
my	1
terrors	1
round	1
about,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
none	1
escaped	1
nor	1
remained:	1
those	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
swaddled	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
hath	1
mine	1
enemy	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:1	1
I	1
AM	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
affliction	1
by	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
3:2	1
He	1
hath	1
led	1
me,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
darkness,	1
but	1
not	1
into	1
light.	1
	1
3:3	1
Surely	1
against	1
me	1
is	1
he	1
turned;	1
he	1
turneth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
3:4	1
My	1
flesh	1
and	1
my	1
skin	1
hath	1
he	1
made	1
old;	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
my	1
bones.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
hath	1
builded	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
compassed	1
me	1
with	1
gall	1
and	1
travail.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
hath	1
set	1
me	1
in	1
dark	1
places,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
dead	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
3:7	1
He	1
hath	1
hedged	1
me	1
about,	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
get	1
out:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
my	1
chain	1
heavy.	1
	1
3:8	1
Also	1
when	1
I	1
cry	1
and	1
shout,	1
he	1
shutteth	1
out	1
my	1
prayer.	1
	1
3:9	1
He	1
hath	1
inclosed	1
my	1
ways	1
with	1
hewn	1
stone,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
my	1
paths	1
crooked.	1
	1
3:10	1
He	1
was	1
unto	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
secret	1
places.	1
	1
3:11	1
He	1
hath	1
turned	1
aside	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
pulled	1
me	1
in	1
pieces:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
desolate.	1
	1
3:12	1
He	1
hath	1
bent	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
for	1
the	1
arrow.	1
	1
3:13	1
He	1
hath	1
caused	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
his	1
quiver	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
reins.	1
	1
3:14	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
derision	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
their	1
song	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
3:15	1
He	1
hath	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
bitterness,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
drunken	1
with	1
wormwood.	1
	1
3:16	1
He	1
hath	1
also	1
broken	1
my	1
teeth	1
with	1
gravel	1
stones,	1
he	1
hath	1
covered	1
me	1
with	1
ashes.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
removed	1
my	1
soul	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
peace:	1
I	1
forgat	1
prosperity.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
My	1
strength	1
and	1
my	1
hope	1
is	1
perished	1
from	1
the	1
LORD:	1
3:19	1
Remembering	1
mine	1
affliction	1
and	1
my	1
misery,	1
the	1
wormwood	1
and	1
the	1
gall.	1
	1
3:20	1
My	1
soul	1
hath	1
them	1
still	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
and	1
is	1
humbled	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
3:21	1
This	1
I	1
recall	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hope.	1
	1
3:22	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
mercies	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
consumed,	1
because	1
his	1
compassions	1
fail	1
not.	1
	1
3:23	1
They	1
are	1
new	1
every	1
morning:	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
faithfulness.	1
	1
3:24	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
portion,	1
saith	1
my	1
soul;	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
hope	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
3:25	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
good	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
seeketh	1
him.	1
	1
3:26	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
both	1
hope	1
and	1
quietly	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:27	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
bear	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
3:28	1
He	1
sitteth	1
alone	1
and	1
keepeth	1
silence,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
borne	1
it	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
3:29	1
He	1
putteth	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
dust;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
hope.	1
	1
3:30	1
He	1
giveth	1
his	1
cheek	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
him:	1
he	1
is	1
filled	1
full	1
with	1
reproach.	1
	1
3:31	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
cast	1
off	1
for	1
ever:	1
3:32	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
cause	1
grief,	1
yet	1
will	1
he	1
have	1
compassion	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
mercies.	1
	1
3:33	1
For	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
afflict	1
willingly	1
nor	1
grieve	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
3:34	1
To	1
crush	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:35	1
To	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
3:36	1
To	1
subvert	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
cause,	1
the	1
LORD	1
approveth	1
not.	1
	1
3:37	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
saith,	1
and	1
it	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
commandeth	1
it	1
not?	1
	1
3:38	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
proceedeth	1
not	1
evil	1
and	1
good?	1
	1
3:39	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
a	1
living	1
man	1
complain,	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
his	1
sins?	1
	1
3:40	1
Let	1
us	1
search	1
and	1
try	1
our	1
ways,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:41	1
Let	1
us	1
lift	1
up	1
our	1
heart	1
with	1
our	1
hands	1
unto	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
3:42	1
We	1
have	1
transgressed	1
and	1
have	1
rebelled:	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
pardoned.	1
	1
3:43	1
Thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
with	1
anger,	1
and	1
persecuted	1
us:	1
thou	1
hast	1
slain,	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
pitied.	1
	1
3:44	1
Thou	1
hast	1
covered	1
thyself	1
with	1
a	1
cloud,	1
that	1
our	1
prayer	1
should	1
not	1
pass	1
through.	1
	1
3:45	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
as	1
the	1
offscouring	1
and	1
refuse	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:46	1
All	1
our	1
enemies	1
have	1
opened	1
their	1
mouths	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
3:47	1
Fear	1
and	1
a	1
snare	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us,	1
desolation	1
and	1
destruction.	1
	1
3:48	1
Mine	1
eye	1
runneth	1
down	1
with	1
rivers	1
of	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
3:49	1
Mine	1
eye	1
trickleth	1
down,	1
and	1
ceaseth	1
not,	1
without	1
any	1
intermission.	1
	1
3:50	1
Till	1
the	1
LORD	1
look	1
down,	1
and	1
behold	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:51	1
Mine	1
eye	1
affecteth	1
mine	1
heart	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
my	1
city.	1
	1
3:52	1
Mine	1
enemies	1
chased	1
me	1
sore,	1
like	1
a	1
bird,	1
without	1
cause.	1
	1
3:53	1
They	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
dungeon,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
stone	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
3:54	1
Waters	1
flowed	1
over	1
mine	1
head;	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
3:55	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
thy	1
name,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
dungeon.	1
	1
3:56	1
Thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
my	1
voice:	1
hide	1
not	1
thine	1
ear	1
at	1
my	1
breathing,	1
at	1
my	1
cry.	1
	1
3:57	1
Thou	1
drewest	1
near	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
thee:	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Fear	1
not.	1
	1
3:58	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
pleaded	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
my	1
soul;	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
3:59	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
my	1
wrong:	1
judge	1
thou	1
my	1
cause.	1
	1
3:60	1
Thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
all	1
their	1
vengeance	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
imaginations	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
3:61	1
Thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
their	1
reproach,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
imaginations	1
against	1
me;	1
3:62	1
The	1
lips	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
their	1
device	1
against	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
3:63	1
Behold	1
their	1
sitting	1
down,	1
and	1
their	1
rising	1
up;	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
musick.	1
	1
3:64	1
Render	1
unto	1
them	1
a	1
recompence,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
3:65	1
Give	1
them	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart,	1
thy	1
curse	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:66	1
Persecute	1
and	1
destroy	1
them	1
in	1
anger	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
heavens	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
How	1
is	1
the	1
gold	1
become	1
dim!	1
how	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
fine	1
gold	1
changed!	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
are	1
poured	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
every	1
street.	1
	1
4:2	1
The	1
precious	1
sons	1
of	1
Zion,	1
comparable	1
to	1
fine	1
gold,	1
how	1
are	1
they	1
esteemed	1
as	1
earthen	1
pitchers,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
potter!	1
4:3	1
Even	1
the	1
sea	1
monsters	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
breast,	1
they	1
give	1
suck	1
to	1
their	1
young	1
ones:	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
become	1
cruel,	1
like	1
the	1
ostriches	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
4:4	1
The	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
sucking	1
child	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
for	1
thirst:	1
the	1
young	1
children	1
ask	1
bread,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
breaketh	1
it	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:5	1
They	1
that	1
did	1
feed	1
delicately	1
are	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
streets:	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
scarlet	1
embrace	1
dunghills.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
that	1
was	1
overthrown	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
no	1
hands	1
stayed	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
4:7	1
Her	1
Nazarites	1
were	1
purer	1
than	1
snow,	1
they	1
were	1
whiter	1
than	1
milk,	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
ruddy	1
in	1
body	1
than	1
rubies,	1
their	1
polishing	1
was	1
of	1
sapphire:	1
4:8	1
Their	1
visage	1
is	1
blacker	1
than	1
a	1
coal;	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
streets:	1
their	1
skin	1
cleaveth	1
to	1
their	1
bones;	1
it	1
is	1
withered,	1
it	1
is	1
become	1
like	1
a	1
stick.	1
	1
4:9	1
They	1
that	1
be	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
are	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
slain	1
with	1
hunger:	1
for	1
these	1
pine	1
away,	1
stricken	1
through	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
4:10	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
pitiful	1
women	1
have	1
sodden	1
their	1
own	1
children:	1
they	1
were	1
their	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
accomplished	1
his	1
fury;	1
he	1
hath	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
and	1
hath	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
it	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:12	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
adversary	1
and	1
the	1
enemy	1
should	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:13	1
For	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
her	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
her	1
priests,	1
that	1
have	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her,	1
4:14	1
They	1
have	1
wandered	1
as	1
blind	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
they	1
have	1
polluted	1
themselves	1
with	1
blood,	1
so	1
that	1
men	1
could	1
not	1
touch	1
their	1
garments.	1
	1
4:15	1
They	1
cried	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
ye;	1
it	1
is	1
unclean;	1
depart,	1
depart,	1
touch	1
not:	1
when	1
they	1
fled	1
away	1
and	1
wandered,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
They	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
sojourn	1
there.	1
	1
4:16	1
The	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
divided	1
them;	1
he	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
regard	1
them:	1
they	1
respected	1
not	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
they	1
favoured	1
not	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
4:17	1
As	1
for	1
us,	1
our	1
eyes	1
as	1
yet	1
failed	1
for	1
our	1
vain	1
help:	1
in	1
our	1
watching	1
we	1
have	1
watched	1
for	1
a	1
nation	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
save	1
us.	1
	1
4:18	1
They	1
hunt	1
our	1
steps,	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
go	1
in	1
our	1
streets:	1
our	1
end	1
is	1
near,	1
our	1
days	1
are	1
fulfilled;	1
for	1
our	1
end	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
4:19	1
Our	1
persecutors	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
eagles	1
of	1
the	1
heaven:	1
they	1
pursued	1
us	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
they	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
4:20	1
The	1
breath	1
of	1
our	1
nostrils,	1
the	1
anointed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
pits,	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
said,	1
Under	1
his	1
shadow	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
4:21	1
Rejoice	1
and	1
be	1
glad,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Edom,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Uz;	1
the	1
cup	1
also	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
unto	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
drunken,	1
and	1
shalt	1
make	1
thyself	1
naked.	1
	1
4:22	1
The	1
punishment	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
is	1
accomplished,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
he	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
carry	1
thee	1
away	1
into	1
captivity:	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Edom;	1
he	1
will	1
discover	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
5:1	1
Remember,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
what	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us:	1
consider,	1
and	1
behold	1
our	1
reproach.	1
	1
5:2	1
Our	1
inheritance	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
strangers,	1
our	1
houses	1
to	1
aliens.	1
	1
5:3	1
We	1
are	1
orphans	1
and	1
fatherless,	1
our	1
mothers	1
are	1
as	1
widows.	1
	1
5:4	1
We	1
have	1
drunken	1
our	1
water	1
for	1
money;	1
our	1
wood	1
is	1
sold	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
5:5	1
Our	1
necks	1
are	1
under	1
persecution:	1
we	1
labour,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
rest.	1
	1
5:6	1
We	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
bread.	1
	1
5:7	1
Our	1
fathers	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
are	1
not;	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
borne	1
their	1
iniquities.	1
	1
5:8	1
Servants	1
have	1
ruled	1
over	1
us:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doth	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
5:9	1
We	1
gat	1
our	1
bread	1
with	1
the	1
peril	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
5:10	1
Our	1
skin	1
was	1
black	1
like	1
an	1
oven	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
famine.	1
	1
5:11	1
They	1
ravished	1
the	1
women	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
maids	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
5:12	1
Princes	1
are	1
hanged	1
up	1
by	1
their	1
hand:	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
elders	1
were	1
not	1
honoured.	1
	1
5:13	1
They	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
grind,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
fell	1
under	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
5:14	1
The	1
elders	1
have	1
ceased	1
from	1
the	1
gate,	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
from	1
their	1
musick.	1
	1
5:15	1
The	1
joy	1
of	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
ceased;	1
our	1
dance	1
is	1
turned	1
into	1
mourning.	1
	1
5:16	1
The	1
crown	1
is	1
fallen	1
from	1
our	1
head:	1
woe	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
sinned!	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
this	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
faint;	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
our	1
eyes	1
are	1
dim.	1
	1
5:18	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Zion,	1
which	1
is	1
desolate,	1
the	1
foxes	1
walk	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
5:19	1
Thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
remainest	1
for	1
ever;	1
thy	1
throne	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
5:20	1
Wherefore	1
dost	1
thou	1
forget	1
us	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
forsake	1
us	1
so	1
long	1
time?	1
	1
5:21	1
Turn	1
thou	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
turned;	1
renew	1
our	1
days	1
as	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
utterly	1
rejected	1
us;	1
thou	1
art	1
very	1
wroth	1
against	1
us.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Prophet	1
Ezekiel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
captives	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar,	1
that	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
visions	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:2	1
In	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Jehoiachin's	1
captivity,	1
1:3	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
expressly	1
unto	1
Ezekiel	1
the	1
priest,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Buzi,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Chebar;	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
there	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
a	1
great	1
cloud,	1
and	1
a	1
fire	1
infolding	1
itself,	1
and	1
a	1
brightness	1
was	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
amber,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
1:5	1
Also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
came	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
four	1
living	1
creatures.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
their	1
appearance;	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
four	1
faces,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
four	1
wings.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
their	1
feet	1
were	1
straight	1
feet;	1
and	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
a	1
calf's	1
foot:	1
and	1
they	1
sparkled	1
like	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
burnished	1
brass.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
their	1
wings	1
on	1
their	1
four	1
sides;	1
and	1
they	1
four	1
had	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
their	1
wings.	1
	1
1:9	1
Their	1
wings	1
were	1
joined	1
one	1
to	1
another;	1
they	1
turned	1
not	1
when	1
they	1
went;	1
they	1
went	1
every	1
one	1
straight	1
forward.	1
	1
1:10	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
their	1
faces,	1
they	1
four	1
had	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side:	1
and	1
they	1
four	1
had	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
ox	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side;	1
they	1
four	1
also	1
had	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
eagle.	1
	1
1:11	1
Thus	1
were	1
their	1
faces:	1
and	1
their	1
wings	1
were	1
stretched	1
upward;	1
two	1
wings	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
were	1
joined	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
two	1
covered	1
their	1
bodies.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
every	1
one	1
straight	1
forward:	1
whither	1
the	1
spirit	1
was	1
to	1
go,	1
they	1
went;	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
not	1
when	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
1:13	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creatures,	1
their	1
appearance	1
was	1
like	1
burning	1
coals	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
lamps:	1
it	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
living	1
creatures;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
bright,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
went	1
forth	1
lightning.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
living	1
creatures	1
ran	1
and	1
returned	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning.	1
	1
1:15	1
Now	1
as	1
I	1
beheld	1
the	1
living	1
creatures,	1
behold	1
one	1
wheel	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
creatures,	1
with	1
his	1
four	1
faces.	1
	1
1:16	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
their	1
work	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
a	1
beryl:	1
and	1
they	1
four	1
had	1
one	1
likeness:	1
and	1
their	1
appearance	1
and	1
their	1
work	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
wheel	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
wheel.	1
	1
1:17	1
When	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
went	1
upon	1
their	1
four	1
sides:	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
not	1
when	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
1:18	1
As	1
for	1
their	1
rings,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
high	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
dreadful;	1
and	1
their	1
rings	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
four.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
creatures	1
went,	1
the	1
wheels	1
went	1
by	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
creatures	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
wheels	1
were	1
lifted	1
up.	1
	1
1:20	1
Whithersoever	1
the	1
spirit	1
was	1
to	1
go,	1
they	1
went,	1
thither	1
was	1
their	1
spirit	1
to	1
go;	1
and	1
the	1
wheels	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
over	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wheels.	1
	1
1:21	1
When	1
those	1
went,	1
these	1
went;	1
and	1
when	1
those	1
stood,	1
these	1
stood;	1
and	1
when	1
those	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
wheels	1
were	1
lifted	1
up	1
over	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wheels.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
firmament	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
terrible	1
crystal,	1
stretched	1
forth	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
above.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
under	1
the	1
firmament	1
were	1
their	1
wings	1
straight,	1
the	1
one	1
toward	1
the	1
other:	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
two,	1
which	1
covered	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
two,	1
which	1
covered	1
on	1
that	1
side,	1
their	1
bodies.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
went,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
their	1
wings,	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
great	1
waters,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
speech,	1
as	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
an	1
host:	1
when	1
they	1
stood,	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
their	1
wings.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
firmament	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
when	1
they	1
stood,	1
and	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
their	1
wings.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
above	1
the	1
firmament	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
was	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
throne,	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
sapphire	1
stone:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
was	1
the	1
likeness	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
above	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
1:27	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
amber,	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire	1
round	1
about	1
within	1
it,	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
even	1
upward,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
even	1
downward,	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
brightness	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
1:28	1
As	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
bow	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
rain,	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
brightness	1
round	1
about.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
it,	1
I	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
spake.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
stand	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
entered	1
into	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
feet,	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
I	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
a	1
rebellious	1
nation	1
that	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me:	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
very	1
day.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
impudent	1
children	1
and	1
stiffhearted.	1
I	1
do	1
send	1
thee	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
they,	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
hear,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
forbear,	1
(for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house,)	1
yet	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
prophet	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
thou,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them,	1
neither	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
words,	1
though	1
briers	1
and	1
thorns	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
dost	1
dwell	1
among	1
scorpions:	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
words,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed	1
at	1
their	1
looks,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
my	1
words	1
unto	1
them,	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
hear,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
forbear:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
most	1
rebellious.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
thou,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
hear	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee;	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
rebellious	1
like	1
that	1
rebellious	1
house:	1
open	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
eat	1
that	1
I	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
looked,	1
behold,	1
an	1
hand	1
was	1
sent	1
unto	1
me;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
was	1
therein;	1
2:10	1
And	1
he	1
spread	1
it	1
before	1
me;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
within	1
and	1
without:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
written	1
therein	1
lamentations,	1
and	1
mourning,	1
and	1
woe.	1
	1
3:1	1
Moreover	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
eat	1
that	1
thou	1
findest;	1
eat	1
this	1
roll,	1
and	1
go	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:2	1
So	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
roll.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
cause	1
thy	1
belly	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
fill	1
thy	1
bowels	1
with	1
this	1
roll	1
that	1
I	1
give	1
thee.	1
Then	1
did	1
I	1
eat	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
as	1
honey	1
for	1
sweetness.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
go,	1
get	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
speak	1
with	1
my	1
words	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
sent	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
speech	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
hard	1
language,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
3:6	1
Not	1
to	1
many	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
speech	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
hard	1
language,	1
whose	1
words	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
understand.	1
Surely,	1
had	1
I	1
sent	1
thee	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thee;	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
impudent	1
and	1
hardhearted.	1
	1
3:8	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thy	1
face	1
strong	1
against	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
thy	1
forehead	1
strong	1
against	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
3:9	1
As	1
an	1
adamant	1
harder	1
than	1
flint	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
thy	1
forehead:	1
fear	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
be	1
dismayed	1
at	1
their	1
looks,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
3:10	1
Moreover	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
all	1
my	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
receive	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
thine	1
ears.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
go,	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
speak	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
tell	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
hear,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
forbear.	1
	1
3:12	1
Then	1
the	1
spirit	1
took	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
behind	1
me	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
rushing,	1
saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
3:13	1
I	1
heard	1
also	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creatures	1
that	1
touched	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
over	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
rushing.	1
	1
3:14	1
So	1
the	1
spirit	1
lifted	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
away,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
bitterness,	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
my	1
spirit;	1
but	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
strong	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
3:15	1
Then	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
at	1
Telabib,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar,	1
and	1
I	1
sat	1
where	1
they	1
sat,	1
and	1
remained	1
there	1
astonished	1
among	1
them	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seven	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
3:17	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
watchman	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
therefore	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
at	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
warning	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
3:18	1
When	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die;	1
and	1
thou	1
givest	1
him	1
not	1
warning,	1
nor	1
speakest	1
to	1
warn	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
his	1
wicked	1
way,	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life;	1
the	1
same	1
wicked	1
man	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
at	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
3:19	1
Yet	1
if	1
thou	1
warn	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
he	1
turn	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness,	1
nor	1
from	1
his	1
wicked	1
way,	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
3:20	1
Again,	1
When	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
doth	1
turn	1
from	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
commit	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
I	1
lay	1
a	1
stumbling-block	1
before	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
die:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
given	1
him	1
warning,	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
sin,	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
remembered;	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
at	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
3:21	1
Nevertheless	1
if	1
thou	1
warn	1
the	1
righteous	1
man,	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
sin	1
not,	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
sin,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
warned;	1
also	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
there	1
upon	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
there	1
talk	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
3:23	1
Then	1
I	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
plain:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
there,	1
as	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar:	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
on	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
the	1
spirit	1
entered	1
into	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
feet,	1
and	1
spake	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
shut	1
thyself	1
within	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
3:25	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
bands	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
bind	1
thee	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
among	1
them:	1
3:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
tongue	1
cleave	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
dumb,	1
and	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
reprover:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
3:27	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
He	1
that	1
heareth,	1
let	1
him	1
hear;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
forbeareth,	1
let	1
him	1
forbear:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
4:1	1
Thou	1
also,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
tile,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
pourtray	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
Jerusalem:	1
4:2	1
And	1
lay	1
siege	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
build	1
a	1
fort	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
mount	1
against	1
it;	1
set	1
the	1
camp	1
also	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
battering	1
rams	1
against	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:3	1
Moreover	1
take	1
thou	1
unto	1
thee	1
an	1
iron	1
pan,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
iron	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
besieged,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lay	1
siege	1
against	1
it.	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:4	1
Lie	1
thou	1
also	1
upon	1
thy	1
left	1
side,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
upon	1
it:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lie	1
upon	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
upon	1
thee	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
days,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
days:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
accomplished	1
them,	1
lie	1
again	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
side,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
forty	1
days:	1
I	1
have	1
appointed	1
thee	1
each	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
year.	1
	1
4:7	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
thine	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
uncovered,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prophesy	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
4:8	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
bands	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
turn	1
thee	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
to	1
another,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
ended	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
siege.	1
	1
4:9	1
Take	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
thee	1
wheat,	1
and	1
barley,	1
and	1
beans,	1
and	1
lentiles,	1
and	1
millet,	1
and	1
fitches,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
vessel,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
bread	1
thereof,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lie	1
upon	1
thy	1
side,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
thy	1
meat	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
shall	1
be	1
by	1
weight,	1
twenty	1
shekels	1
a	1
day:	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
4:11	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
drink	1
also	1
water	1
by	1
measure,	1
the	1
sixth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin:	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
shalt	1
thou	1
drink.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
barley	1
cakes,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bake	1
it	1
with	1
dung	1
that	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
man,	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Even	1
thus	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
eat	1
their	1
defiled	1
bread	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whither	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them.	1
	1
4:14	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
behold,	1
my	1
soul	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
polluted:	1
for	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up	1
even	1
till	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
eaten	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
dieth	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
is	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces;	1
neither	1
came	1
there	1
abominable	1
flesh	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
4:15	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
cow's	1
dung	1
for	1
man's	1
dung,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
thy	1
bread	1
therewith.	1
	1
4:16	1
Moreover	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
by	1
weight,	1
and	1
with	1
care;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
drink	1
water	1
by	1
measure,	1
and	1
with	1
astonishment:	1
4:17	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
want	1
bread	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
be	1
astonied	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
consume	1
away	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
thou,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
sharp	1
knife,	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
barber's	1
razor,	1
and	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
pass	1
upon	1
thine	1
head	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
beard:	1
then	1
take	1
thee	1
balances	1
to	1
weigh,	1
and	1
divide	1
the	1
hair.	1
	1
5:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
siege	1
are	1
fulfilled:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
third	1
part,	1
and	1
smite	1
about	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
knife:	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
thou	1
shalt	1
scatter	1
in	1
the	1
wind;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
out	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
5:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
take	1
thereof	1
a	1
few	1
in	1
number,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
skirts.	1
	1
5:4	1
Then	1
take	1
of	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
burn	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
for	1
thereof	1
shall	1
a	1
fire	1
come	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
This	1
is	1
Jerusalem:	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
countries	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
her.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
she	1
hath	1
changed	1
my	1
judgments	1
into	1
wickedness	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
my	1
statutes	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
countries	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
her:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
refused	1
my	1
judgments	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
walked	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
5:7	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
multiplied	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
neither	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
judgments,	1
neither	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you;	1
5:8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
execute	1
judgments	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
in	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done,	1
and	1
whereunto	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
any	1
more	1
the	1
like,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations.	1
	1
5:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
fathers	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
shall	1
eat	1
their	1
fathers;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
judgments	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
remnant	1
of	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
scatter	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
winds.	1
	1
5:11	1
Wherefore,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Surely,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
defiled	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
detestable	1
things,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
diminish	1
thee;	1
neither	1
shall	1
mine	1
eye	1
spare,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
any	1
pity.	1
	1
5:12	1
A	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
with	1
famine	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
round	1
about	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
winds,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
out	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
5:13	1
Thus	1
shall	1
mine	1
anger	1
be	1
accomplished,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
my	1
fury	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
comforted:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
zeal,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
accomplished	1
my	1
fury	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
waste,	1
and	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
pass	1
by.	1
	1
5:15	1
So	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
reproach	1
and	1
a	1
taunt,	1
an	1
instruction	1
and	1
an	1
astonishment	1
unto	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
execute	1
judgments	1
in	1
thee	1
in	1
anger	1
and	1
in	1
fury	1
and	1
in	1
furious	1
rebukes.	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
5:16	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
evil	1
arrows	1
of	1
famine,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
their	1
destruction,	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
to	1
destroy	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
increase	1
the	1
famine	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
break	1
your	1
staff	1
of	1
bread:	1
5:17	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
upon	1
you	1
famine	1
and	1
evil	1
beasts,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bereave	1
thee:	1
and	1
pestilence	1
and	1
blood	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
sword	1
upon	1
thee.	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
6:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
them,	1
6:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Ye	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
to	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
valleys;	1
Behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
your	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
your	1
altars	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
your	1
images	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
down	1
your	1
slain	1
men	1
before	1
your	1
idols.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
the	1
dead	1
carcases	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
before	1
their	1
idols;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
your	1
bones	1
round	1
about	1
your	1
altars.	1
	1
6:6	1
In	1
all	1
your	1
dwellingplaces	1
the	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate;	1
that	1
your	1
altars	1
may	1
be	1
laid	1
waste	1
and	1
made	1
desolate,	1
and	1
your	1
idols	1
may	1
be	1
broken	1
and	1
cease,	1
and	1
your	1
images	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
and	1
your	1
works	1
may	1
be	1
abolished.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
slain	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:8	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
leave	1
a	1
remnant,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
that	1
shall	1
escape	1
the	1
sword	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
through	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
escape	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
remember	1
me	1
among	1
the	1
nations	1
whither	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
captives,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
broken	1
with	1
their	1
whorish	1
heart,	1
which	1
hath	1
departed	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
which	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
idols:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lothe	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
abominations.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
said	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
this	1
evil	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
6:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Smite	1
with	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
stamp	1
with	1
thy	1
foot,	1
and	1
say,	1
Alas	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel!	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
by	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
pestilence.	1
	1
6:12	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
far	1
off	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
the	1
pestilence;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth	1
and	1
is	1
besieged	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
famine:	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
accomplish	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
6:13	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
their	1
slain	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
their	1
idols	1
round	1
about	1
their	1
altars,	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
thick	1
oak,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
did	1
offer	1
sweet	1
savour	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
idols.	1
	1
6:14	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
desolate,	1
yea,	1
more	1
desolate	1
than	1
the	1
wilderness	1
toward	1
Diblath,	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
habitations:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
7:2	1
Also,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
An	1
end,	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
7:3	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
mine	1
anger	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
judge	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
will	1
recompense	1
upon	1
thee	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
spare	1
thee,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
pity:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
thy	1
ways	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thine	1
abominations	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
An	1
evil,	1
an	1
only	1
evil,	1
behold,	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
7:6	1
An	1
end	1
is	1
come,	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
come:	1
it	1
watcheth	1
for	1
thee;	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
7:7	1
The	1
morning	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble	1
is	1
near,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
sounding	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
7:8	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
shortly	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
accomplish	1
mine	1
anger	1
upon	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
will	1
recompense	1
thee	1
for	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
spare,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
pity:	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
ways	1
and	1
thine	1
abominations	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
smiteth.	1
	1
7:10	1
Behold	1
the	1
day,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
come:	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
gone	1
forth;	1
the	1
rod	1
hath	1
blossomed,	1
pride	1
hath	1
budded.	1
	1
7:11	1
Violence	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
wickedness:	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
remain,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
multitude,	1
nor	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
their's:	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
wailing	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
7:12	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
come,	1
the	1
day	1
draweth	1
near:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
buyer	1
rejoice,	1
nor	1
the	1
seller	1
mourn:	1
for	1
wrath	1
is	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:13	1
For	1
the	1
seller	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
sold,	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
yet	1
alive:	1
for	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
touching	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
thereof,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
return;	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
strengthen	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
7:14	1
They	1
have	1
blown	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
ready;	1
but	1
none	1
goeth	1
to	1
the	1
battle:	1
for	1
my	1
wrath	1
is	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:15	1
The	1
sword	1
is	1
without,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence	1
and	1
the	1
famine	1
within:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
famine	1
and	1
pestilence	1
shall	1
devour	1
him.	1
	1
7:16	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
escape	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
escape,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
mountains	1
like	1
doves	1
of	1
the	1
valleys,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
mourning,	1
every	1
one	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:17	1
All	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
feeble,	1
and	1
all	1
knees	1
shall	1
be	1
weak	1
as	1
water.	1
	1
7:18	1
They	1
shall	1
also	1
gird	1
themselves	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
horror	1
shall	1
cover	1
them;	1
and	1
shame	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
all	1
faces,	1
and	1
baldness	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
7:19	1
They	1
shall	1
cast	1
their	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
shall	1
be	1
removed:	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
satisfy	1
their	1
souls,	1
neither	1
fill	1
their	1
bowels:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:20	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
his	1
ornament,	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
majesty:	1
but	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
abominations	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
detestable	1
things	1
therein:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
set	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
for	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
a	1
spoil;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pollute	1
it.	1
	1
7:22	1
My	1
face	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
also	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pollute	1
my	1
secret	1
place:	1
for	1
the	1
robbers	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
defile	1
it.	1
	1
7:23	1
Make	1
a	1
chain:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
bloody	1
crimes,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
violence.	1
	1
7:24	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
their	1
houses:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
the	1
pomp	1
of	1
the	1
strong	1
to	1
cease;	1
and	1
their	1
holy	1
places	1
shall	1
be	1
defiled.	1
	1
7:25	1
Destruction	1
cometh;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none.	1
	1
7:26	1
Mischief	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
mischief,	1
and	1
rumour	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
rumour;	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
prophet;	1
but	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
counsel	1
from	1
the	1
ancients.	1
	1
7:27	1
The	1
king	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
troubled:	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
after	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
deserts	1
will	1
I	1
judge	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
as	1
I	1
sat	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah	1
sat	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
fell	1
there	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
8:2	1
Then	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
a	1
likeness	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire:	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
even	1
downward,	1
fire;	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
loins	1
even	1
upward,	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
brightness,	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
amber.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
by	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
mine	1
head;	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
lifted	1
me	1
up	1
between	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
gate	1
that	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
north;	1
where	1
was	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
which	1
provoketh	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
	1
8:4	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
there,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
vision	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
plain.	1
	1
8:5	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
now	1
the	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
north.	1
So	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
the	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
behold	1
northward	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
this	1
image	1
of	1
jealousy	1
in	1
the	1
entry.	1
	1
8:6	1
He	1
said	1
furthermore	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
seest	1
thou	1
what	1
they	1
do?	1
even	1
the	1
great	1
abominations	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
committeth	1
here,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
my	1
sanctuary?	1
but	1
turn	1
thee	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
abominations.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
court;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
looked,	1
behold	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
8:8	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
dig	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
behold	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
in,	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
wicked	1
abominations	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
here.	1
	1
8:10	1
So	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
saw;	1
and	1
behold	1
every	1
form	1
of	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
abominable	1
beasts,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
pourtrayed	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
them	1
seventy	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
stood	1
Jaazaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
with	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud	1
of	1
incense	1
went	1
up.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
what	1
the	1
ancients	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
his	1
imagery?	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
LORD	1
seeth	1
us	1
not;	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:13	1
He	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
me,	1
Turn	1
thee	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
abominations	1
that	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
8:14	1
Then	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
which	1
was	1
toward	1
the	1
north;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
sat	1
women	1
weeping	1
for	1
Tammuz.	1
	1
8:15	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
this,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man?	1
turn	1
thee	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
abominations	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
between	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
men,	1
with	1
their	1
backs	1
toward	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
toward	1
the	1
east;	1
and	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
sun	1
toward	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
this,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man?	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
that	1
they	1
commit	1
the	1
abominations	1
which	1
they	1
commit	1
here?	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
filled	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
violence,	1
and	1
have	1
returned	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
branch	1
to	1
their	1
nose.	1
	1
8:18	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
deal	1
in	1
fury:	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
spare,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
pity:	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
cry	1
in	1
mine	1
ears	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
9:1	1
He	1
cried	1
also	1
in	1
mine	1
ears	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Cause	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
charge	1
over	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
draw	1
near,	1
even	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
destroying	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
9:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
six	1
men	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
gate,	1
which	1
lieth	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
slaughter	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
one	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen,	1
with	1
a	1
writer's	1
inkhorn	1
by	1
his	1
side:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
gone	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
cherub,	1
whereupon	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
writer's	1
inkhorn	1
by	1
his	1
side;	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
the	1
foreheads	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sigh	1
and	1
that	1
cry	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
that	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
mine	1
hearing,	1
Go	1
ye	1
after	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
smite:	1
let	1
not	1
your	1
eye	1
spare,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
pity:	1
9:6	1
Slay	1
utterly	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
both	1
maids,	1
and	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
women:	1
but	1
come	1
not	1
near	1
any	1
man	1
upon	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
mark;	1
and	1
begin	1
at	1
my	1
sanctuary.	1
Then	1
they	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
ancient	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Defile	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
courts	1
with	1
the	1
slain:	1
go	1
ye	1
forth.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
slew	1
in	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
slaying	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
left,	1
that	1
I	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
cried,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
wilt	1
thou	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
thy	1
pouring	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
fury	1
upon	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
9:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah	1
is	1
exceeding	1
great,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
blood,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
full	1
of	1
perverseness:	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
seeth	1
not.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
me	1
also,	1
mine	1
eye	1
shall	1
not	1
spare,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
pity,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
their	1
way	1
upon	1
their	1
head.	1
	1
9:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
inkhorn	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
reported	1
the	1
matter,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
me.	1
	1
10:1	1
Then	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
that	1
was	1
above	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims	1
there	1
appeared	1
over	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sapphire	1
stone,	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
a	1
throne.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
in	1
between	1
the	1
wheels,	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
cherub,	1
and	1
fill	1
thine	1
hand	1
with	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
and	1
scatter	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
city.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
10:3	1
Now	1
the	1
cherubims	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
went	1
in;	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
filled	1
the	1
inner	1
court.	1
	1
10:4	1
Then	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
cherub,	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
glory.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims'	1
wings	1
was	1
heard	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
outer	1
court,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God	1
when	1
he	1
speaketh.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
fire	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
wheels,	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims;	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
wheels.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
one	1
cherub	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims	1
unto	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
and	1
took	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen:	1
who	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
cherubims	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hand	1
under	1
their	1
wings.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
looked,	1
behold	1
the	1
four	1
wheels	1
by	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
one	1
wheel	1
by	1
one	1
cherub,	1
and	1
another	1
wheel	1
by	1
another	1
cherub:	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
a	1
beryl	1
stone.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
appearances,	1
they	1
four	1
had	1
one	1
likeness,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
wheel	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
wheel.	1
	1
10:11	1
When	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
went	1
upon	1
their	1
four	1
sides;	1
they	1
turned	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
the	1
head	1
looked	1
they	1
followed	1
it;	1
they	1
turned	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
their	1
whole	1
body,	1
and	1
their	1
backs,	1
and	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
their	1
wings,	1
and	1
the	1
wheels,	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
round	1
about,	1
even	1
the	1
wheels	1
that	1
they	1
four	1
had.	1
	1
10:13	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
wheels,	1
it	1
was	1
cried	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
my	1
hearing,	1
O	1
wheel.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
four	1
faces:	1
the	1
first	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
cherub,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
face	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
eagle.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
cherubims	1
were	1
lifted	1
up.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cherubims	1
went,	1
the	1
wheels	1
went	1
by	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
cherubims	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
wings	1
to	1
mount	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
same	1
wheels	1
also	1
turned	1
not	1
from	1
beside	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
When	1
they	1
stood,	1
these	1
stood;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
lifted	1
up,	1
these	1
lifted	1
up	1
themselves	1
also:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
was	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
10:18	1
Then	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
departed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
the	1
cherubims.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
cherubims	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
wings,	1
and	1
mounted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
my	1
sight:	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
the	1
wheels	1
also	1
were	1
beside	1
them,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
over	1
them	1
above.	1
	1
10:20	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar;	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
cherubims.	1
	1
10:21	1
Every	1
one	1
had	1
four	1
faces	1
apiece,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
four	1
wings;	1
and	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
under	1
their	1
wings.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
their	1
faces	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
faces	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Chebar,	1
their	1
appearances	1
and	1
themselves:	1
they	1
went	1
every	1
one	1
straight	1
forward.	1
	1
11:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
spirit	1
lifted	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
east	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house,	1
which	1
looketh	1
eastward:	1
and	1
behold	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
men;	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
saw	1
Jaazaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azur,	1
and	1
Pelatiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Benaiah,	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:2	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
devise	1
mischief,	1
and	1
give	1
wicked	1
counsel	1
in	1
this	1
city:	1
11:3	1
Which	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
near;	1
let	1
us	1
build	1
houses:	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
the	1
caldron,	1
and	1
we	1
be	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
11:4	1
Therefore	1
prophesy	1
against	1
them,	1
prophesy,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
fell	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Speak;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thus	1
have	1
ye	1
said,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
come	1
into	1
your	1
mind,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
multiplied	1
your	1
slain	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
filled	1
the	1
streets	1
thereof	1
with	1
the	1
slain.	1
	1
11:7	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Your	1
slain	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
the	1
caldron:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
11:8	1
Ye	1
have	1
feared	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
deliver	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
strangers,	1
and	1
will	1
execute	1
judgments	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
11:10	1
Ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:11	1
This	1
city	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
your	1
caldron,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Israel:	1
11:12	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
neither	1
executed	1
my	1
judgments,	1
but	1
have	1
done	1
after	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
prophesied,	1
that	1
Pelatiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Benaiah	1
died.	1
Then	1
fell	1
I	1
down	1
upon	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
wilt	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
full	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
11:14	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
11:15	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
even	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
wholly,	1
are	1
they	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
said,	1
Get	1
you	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
LORD:	1
unto	1
us	1
is	1
this	1
land	1
given	1
in	1
possession.	1
	1
11:16	1
Therefore	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Although	1
I	1
have	1
cast	1
them	1
far	1
off	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
although	1
I	1
have	1
scattered	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
countries,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
sanctuary	1
in	1
the	1
countries	1
where	1
they	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
11:17	1
Therefore	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
gather	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
assemble	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countries	1
where	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
scattered,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
thither,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
detestable	1
things	1
thereof	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
thereof	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
one	1
heart,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
new	1
spirit	1
within	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
stony	1
heart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
flesh,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
heart	1
of	1
flesh:	1
11:20	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
11:21	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
them	1
whose	1
heart	1
walketh	1
after	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
their	1
detestable	1
things	1
and	1
their	1
abominations,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense	1
their	1
way	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
heads,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
did	1
the	1
cherubims	1
lift	1
up	1
their	1
wings,	1
and	1
the	1
wheels	1
beside	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
over	1
them	1
above.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
mountain	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:24	1
Afterwards	1
the	1
spirit	1
took	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
Chaldea,	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity.	1
So	1
the	1
vision	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shewed	1
me.	1
	1
12:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
also	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
12:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
thou	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house,	1
which	1
have	1
eyes	1
to	1
see,	1
and	1
see	1
not;	1
they	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
hear	1
not:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prepare	1
thee	1
stuff	1
for	1
removing,	1
and	1
remove	1
by	1
day	1
in	1
their	1
sight;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remove	1
from	1
thy	1
place	1
to	1
another	1
place	1
in	1
their	1
sight:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
consider,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
a	1
rebellious	1
house.	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bring	1
forth	1
thy	1
stuff	1
by	1
day	1
in	1
their	1
sight,	1
as	1
stuff	1
for	1
removing:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
forth	1
at	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
sight,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
12:5	1
Dig	1
thou	1
through	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
their	1
sight,	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
thereby.	1
	1
12:6	1
In	1
their	1
sight	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bear	1
it	1
upon	1
thy	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
twilight:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cover	1
thy	1
face,	1
that	1
thou	1
see	1
not	1
the	1
ground:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
commanded:	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
my	1
stuff	1
by	1
day,	1
as	1
stuff	1
for	1
captivity,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
even	1
I	1
digged	1
through	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
mine	1
hand;	1
I	1
brought	1
it	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
I	1
bare	1
it	1
upon	1
my	1
shoulder	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
12:9	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
rebellious	1
house,	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
12:10	1
Say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
This	1
burden	1
concerneth	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
are	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
12:11	1
Say,	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
sign:	1
like	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
remove	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
them	1
shall	1
bear	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
forth:	1
they	1
shall	1
dig	1
through	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
thereby:	1
he	1
shall	1
cover	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
he	1
see	1
not	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
12:13	1
My	1
net	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
spread	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
my	1
snare:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
see	1
it,	1
though	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
there.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
toward	1
every	1
wind	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
him	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bands;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
sword	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
scatter	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
disperse	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
from	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
pestilence;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
declare	1
all	1
their	1
abominations	1
among	1
the	1
heathen	1
whither	1
they	1
come;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:17	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
12:18	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
eat	1
thy	1
bread	1
with	1
quaking,	1
and	1
drink	1
thy	1
water	1
with	1
trembling	1
and	1
with	1
carefulness;	1
12:19	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
They	1
shall	1
eat	1
their	1
bread	1
with	1
carefulness,	1
and	1
drink	1
their	1
water	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
that	1
her	1
land	1
may	1
be	1
desolate	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
inhabited	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
12:22	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
proverb	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
days	1
are	1
prolonged,	1
and	1
every	1
vision	1
faileth?	1
	1
12:23	1
Tell	1
them	1
therefore,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
this	1
proverb	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
use	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
proverb	1
in	1
Israel;	1
but	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
days	1
are	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
every	1
vision.	1
	1
12:24	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
any	1
vain	1
vision	1
nor	1
flattering	1
divination	1
within	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:25	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
will	1
speak,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
prolonged:	1
for	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
O	1
rebellious	1
house,	1
will	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
will	1
perform	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
12:26	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying.	1
	1
12:27	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
behold,	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
say,	1
The	1
vision	1
that	1
he	1
seeth	1
is	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
he	1
prophesieth	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
12:28	1
Therefore	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
There	1
shall	1
none	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
be	1
prolonged	1
any	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
shall	1
be	1
done,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
against	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
13:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
foolish	1
prophets,	1
that	1
follow	1
their	1
own	1
spirit,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing!	1
	1
13:4	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
prophets	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
foxes	1
in	1
the	1
deserts.	1
	1
13:5	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
gone	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
gaps,	1
neither	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
hedge	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:6	1
They	1
have	1
seen	1
vanity	1
and	1
lying	1
divination,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
saith:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
others	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
confirm	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
13:7	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
vain	1
vision,	1
and	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
spoken	1
a	1
lying	1
divination,	1
whereas	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
saith	1
it;	1
albeit	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken?	1
	1
13:8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
vanity,	1
and	1
seen	1
lies,	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
mine	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
see	1
vanity,	1
and	1
that	1
divine	1
lies:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
13:10	1
Because,	1
even	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
seduced	1
my	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Peace;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
peace;	1
and	1
one	1
built	1
up	1
a	1
wall,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
others	1
daubed	1
it	1
with	1
untempered	1
morter:	1
13:11	1
Say	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
daub	1
it	1
with	1
untempered	1
morter,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
fall:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
overflowing	1
shower;	1
and	1
ye,	1
O	1
great	1
hailstones,	1
shall	1
fall;	1
and	1
a	1
stormy	1
wind	1
shall	1
rend	1
it.	1
	1
13:12	1
Lo,	1
when	1
the	1
wall	1
is	1
fallen,	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
daubing	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
have	1
daubed	1
it?	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
rend	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
stormy	1
wind	1
in	1
my	1
fury;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
overflowing	1
shower	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
great	1
hailstones	1
in	1
my	1
fury	1
to	1
consume	1
it.	1
	1
13:14	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
daubed	1
with	1
untempered	1
morter,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
discovered,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:15	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
accomplish	1
my	1
wrath	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
daubed	1
it	1
with	1
untempered	1
morter,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
wall	1
is	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
they	1
that	1
daubed	1
it;	1
13:16	1
To	1
wit,	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
prophesy	1
concerning	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
which	1
see	1
visions	1
of	1
peace	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
13:17	1
Likewise,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
prophesy	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
heart;	1
and	1
prophesy	1
thou	1
against	1
them,	1
13:18	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
sew	1
pillows	1
to	1
all	1
armholes,	1
and	1
make	1
kerchiefs	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
stature	1
to	1
hunt	1
souls!	1
Will	1
ye	1
hunt	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
will	1
ye	1
save	1
the	1
souls	1
alive	1
that	1
come	1
unto	1
you?	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
will	1
ye	1
pollute	1
me	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
for	1
handfuls	1
of	1
barley	1
and	1
for	1
pieces	1
of	1
bread,	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
should	1
not	1
die,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
souls	1
alive	1
that	1
should	1
not	1
live,	1
by	1
your	1
lying	1
to	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
hear	1
your	1
lies?	1
	1
13:20	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
your	1
pillows,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
there	1
hunt	1
the	1
souls	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
fly,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tear	1
them	1
from	1
your	1
arms,	1
and	1
will	1
let	1
the	1
souls	1
go,	1
even	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
ye	1
hunt	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
fly.	1
	1
13:21	1
Your	1
kerchiefs	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
tear,	1
and	1
deliver	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
your	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
hunted;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:22	1
Because	1
with	1
lies	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
sad,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
sad;	1
and	1
strengthened	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
wicked	1
way,	1
by	1
promising	1
him	1
life:	1
13:23	1
Therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
more	1
vanity,	1
nor	1
divine	1
divinations:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
hand:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:1	1
Then	1
came	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
14:3	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
these	1
men	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
idols	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity	1
before	1
their	1
face:	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
enquired	1
of	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
them?	1
	1
14:4	1
Therefore	1
speak	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Every	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
setteth	1
up	1
his	1
idols	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
putteth	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
of	1
his	1
iniquity	1
before	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
prophet;	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
answer	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
idols;	1
14:5	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
heart,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
estranged	1
from	1
me	1
through	1
their	1
idols.	1
	1
14:6	1
Therefore	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Repent,	1
and	1
turn	1
yourselves	1
from	1
your	1
idols;	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
your	1
faces	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
abominations.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
in	1
Israel,	1
which	1
separateth	1
himself	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
his	1
idols	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
putteth	1
the	1
stumblingblock	1
of	1
his	1
iniquity	1
before	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
a	1
prophet	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
him	1
concerning	1
me;	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
answer	1
him	1
by	1
myself:	1
14:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
and	1
a	1
proverb,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
prophet	1
be	1
deceived	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
a	1
thing,	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
deceived	1
that	1
prophet,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
destroy	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
seeketh	1
unto	1
him;	1
14:11	1
That	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
astray	1
from	1
me,	1
neither	1
be	1
polluted	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
transgressions;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
14:12	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
14:13	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
when	1
the	1
land	1
sinneth	1
against	1
me	1
by	1
trespassing	1
grievously,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
send	1
famine	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
from	1
it:	1
14:14	1
Though	1
these	1
three	1
men,	1
Noah,	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
Job,	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
they	1
should	1
deliver	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
souls	1
by	1
their	1
righteousness,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
14:15	1
If	1
I	1
cause	1
noisome	1
beasts	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
spoil	1
it,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
desolate,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
pass	1
through	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
beasts:	1
14:16	1
Though	1
these	1
three	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
neither	1
sons	1
nor	1
daughters;	1
they	1
only	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered,	1
but	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
14:17	1
Or	1
if	1
I	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
that	1
land,	1
and	1
say,	1
Sword,	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
land;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
from	1
it:	1
14:18	1
Though	1
these	1
three	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
neither	1
sons	1
nor	1
daughters,	1
but	1
they	1
only	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
themselves.	1
	1
14:19	1
Or	1
if	1
I	1
send	1
a	1
pestilence	1
into	1
that	1
land,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
it	1
in	1
blood,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
it	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
14:20	1
Though	1
Noah,	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
Job	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
neither	1
son	1
nor	1
daughter;	1
they	1
shall	1
but	1
deliver	1
their	1
own	1
souls	1
by	1
their	1
righteousness.	1
	1
14:21	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
when	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
four	1
sore	1
judgments	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
famine,	1
and	1
the	1
noisome	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
it	1
man	1
and	1
beast?	1
14:22	1
Yet,	1
behold,	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
remnant	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
forth,	1
both	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters:	1
behold,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
way	1
and	1
their	1
doings:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted	1
concerning	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
concerning	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
comfort	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
their	1
ways	1
and	1
their	1
doings:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
without	1
cause	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
vine	1
tree	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
tree,	1
or	1
than	1
a	1
branch	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
forest?	1
	1
15:3	1
Shall	1
wood	1
be	1
taken	1
thereof	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
work?	1
or	1
will	1
men	1
take	1
a	1
pin	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
hang	1
any	1
vessel	1
thereon?	1
15:4	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
for	1
fuel;	1
the	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
both	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
burned.	1
Is	1
it	1
meet	1
for	1
any	1
work?	1
	1
15:5	1
Behold,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
whole,	1
it	1
was	1
meet	1
for	1
no	1
work:	1
how	1
much	1
less	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
meet	1
yet	1
for	1
any	1
work,	1
when	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
burned?	1
	1
15:6	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
As	1
the	1
vine	1
tree	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
for	1
fuel,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
one	1
fire,	1
and	1
another	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
them;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
desolate,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
a	1
trespass,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
16:1	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
16:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
cause	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
abominations,	1
16:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
unto	1
Jerusalem;	1
Thy	1
birth	1
and	1
thy	1
nativity	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
thy	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
an	1
Hittite.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
thy	1
nativity,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
thou	1
wast	1
born	1
thy	1
navel	1
was	1
not	1
cut,	1
neither	1
wast	1
thou	1
washed	1
in	1
water	1
to	1
supple	1
thee;	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
salted	1
at	1
all,	1
nor	1
swaddled	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
16:5	1
None	1
eye	1
pitied	1
thee,	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
thee;	1
but	1
thou	1
wast	1
cast	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
to	1
the	1
lothing	1
of	1
thy	1
person,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
born.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
passed	1
by	1
thee,	1
and	1
saw	1
thee	1
polluted	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
blood,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
in	1
thy	1
blood,	1
Live;	1
yea,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
in	1
thy	1
blood,	1
Live.	1
	1
16:7	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
multiply	1
as	1
the	1
bud	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
increased	1
and	1
waxen	1
great,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
to	1
excellent	1
ornaments:	1
thy	1
breasts	1
are	1
fashioned,	1
and	1
thine	1
hair	1
is	1
grown,	1
whereas	1
thou	1
wast	1
naked	1
and	1
bare.	1
	1
16:8	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
passed	1
by	1
thee,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
thee,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
time	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
love;	1
and	1
I	1
spread	1
my	1
skirt	1
over	1
thee,	1
and	1
covered	1
thy	1
nakedness:	1
yea,	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
and	1
thou	1
becamest	1
mine.	1
	1
16:9	1
Then	1
washed	1
I	1
thee	1
with	1
water;	1
yea,	1
I	1
throughly	1
washed	1
away	1
thy	1
blood	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
oil.	1
	1
16:10	1
I	1
clothed	1
thee	1
also	1
with	1
broidered	1
work,	1
and	1
shod	1
thee	1
with	1
badgers'	1
skin,	1
and	1
I	1
girded	1
thee	1
about	1
with	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
I	1
covered	1
thee	1
with	1
silk.	1
	1
16:11	1
I	1
decked	1
thee	1
also	1
with	1
ornaments,	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
thy	1
hands,	1
and	1
a	1
chain	1
on	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
I	1
put	1
a	1
jewel	1
on	1
thy	1
forehead,	1
and	1
earrings	1
in	1
thine	1
ears,	1
and	1
a	1
beautiful	1
crown	1
upon	1
thine	1
head.	1
	1
16:13	1
Thus	1
wast	1
thou	1
decked	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver;	1
and	1
thy	1
raiment	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
silk,	1
and	1
broidered	1
work;	1
thou	1
didst	1
eat	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
honey,	1
and	1
oil:	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
exceeding	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
prosper	1
into	1
a	1
kingdom.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
thy	1
renown	1
went	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
heathen	1
for	1
thy	1
beauty:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
perfect	1
through	1
my	1
comeliness,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
upon	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
16:15	1
But	1
thou	1
didst	1
trust	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
beauty,	1
and	1
playedst	1
the	1
harlot	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
renown,	1
and	1
pouredst	1
out	1
thy	1
fornications	1
on	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passed	1
by;	1
his	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
of	1
thy	1
garments	1
thou	1
didst	1
take,	1
and	1
deckedst	1
thy	1
high	1
places	1
with	1
divers	1
colours,	1
and	1
playedst	1
the	1
harlot	1
thereupon:	1
the	1
like	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
come,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
16:17	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
taken	1
thy	1
fair	1
jewels	1
of	1
my	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
silver,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
thee,	1
and	1
madest	1
to	1
thyself	1
images	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
didst	1
commit	1
whoredom	1
with	1
them,	1
16:18	1
And	1
tookest	1
thy	1
broidered	1
garments,	1
and	1
coveredst	1
them:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
mine	1
oil	1
and	1
mine	1
incense	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
16:19	1
My	1
meat	1
also	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
thee,	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
honey,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
fed	1
thee,	1
thou	1
hast	1
even	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour:	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
16:20	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
borne	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
these	1
hast	1
thou	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
devoured.	1
Is	1
this	1
of	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
a	1
small	1
matter,	1
16:21	1
That	1
thou	1
hast	1
slain	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire	1
for	1
them?	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations	1
and	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
naked	1
and	1
bare,	1
and	1
wast	1
polluted	1
in	1
thy	1
blood.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
all	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
(woe,	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee!	1
	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
GOD;)	1
16:24	1
That	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
built	1
unto	1
thee	1
an	1
eminent	1
place,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
thee	1
an	1
high	1
place	1
in	1
every	1
street.	1
	1
16:25	1
Thou	1
hast	1
built	1
thy	1
high	1
place	1
at	1
every	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
thy	1
beauty	1
to	1
be	1
abhorred,	1
and	1
hast	1
opened	1
thy	1
feet	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
thy	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
16:26	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
committed	1
fornication	1
with	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
thy	1
neighbours,	1
great	1
of	1
flesh;	1
and	1
hast	1
increased	1
thy	1
whoredoms,	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
16:27	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
out	1
my	1
hand	1
over	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
diminished	1
thine	1
ordinary	1
food,	1
and	1
delivered	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee,	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
which	1
are	1
ashamed	1
of	1
thy	1
lewd	1
way.	1
	1
16:28	1
Thou	1
hast	1
played	1
the	1
whore	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
because	1
thou	1
wast	1
unsatiable;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
hast	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
yet	1
couldest	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
	1
16:29	1
Thou	1
hast	1
moreover	1
multiplied	1
thy	1
fornication	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
unto	1
Chaldea;	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
satisfied	1
therewith.	1
	1
16:30	1
How	1
weak	1
is	1
thine	1
heart,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
GOD,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
doest	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
imperious	1
whorish	1
woman;	1
16:31	1
In	1
that	1
thou	1
buildest	1
thine	1
eminent	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
way,	1
and	1
makest	1
thine	1
high	1
place	1
in	1
every	1
street;	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
as	1
an	1
harlot,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
scornest	1
hire;	1
16:32	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
committeth	1
adultery,	1
which	1
taketh	1
strangers	1
instead	1
of	1
her	1
husband!	1
16:33	1
They	1
give	1
gifts	1
to	1
all	1
whores:	1
but	1
thou	1
givest	1
thy	1
gifts	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
lovers,	1
and	1
hirest	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
for	1
thy	1
whoredom.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
the	1
contrary	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
from	1
other	1
women	1
in	1
thy	1
whoredoms,	1
whereas	1
none	1
followeth	1
thee	1
to	1
commit	1
whoredoms:	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
givest	1
a	1
reward,	1
and	1
no	1
reward	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
thee,	1
therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
contrary.	1
	1
16:35	1
Wherefore,	1
O	1
harlot,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
16:36	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thy	1
filthiness	1
was	1
poured	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
discovered	1
through	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
with	1
thy	1
lovers,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
thy	1
abominations,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
children,	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
give	1
unto	1
them;	1
16:37	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
thy	1
lovers,	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved,	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hated;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
gather	1
them	1
round	1
about	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
discover	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
all	1
thy	1
nakedness.	1
	1
16:38	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
thee,	1
as	1
women	1
that	1
break	1
wedlock	1
and	1
shed	1
blood	1
are	1
judged;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
blood	1
in	1
fury	1
and	1
jealousy.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
give	1
thee	1
into	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
throw	1
down	1
thine	1
eminent	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
thy	1
high	1
places:	1
they	1
shall	1
strip	1
thee	1
also	1
of	1
thy	1
clothes,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
thy	1
fair	1
jewels,	1
and	1
leave	1
thee	1
naked	1
and	1
bare.	1
	1
16:40	1
They	1
shall	1
also	1
bring	1
up	1
a	1
company	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
stone	1
thee	1
with	1
stones,	1
and	1
thrust	1
thee	1
through	1
with	1
their	1
swords.	1
	1
16:41	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
thine	1
houses	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
execute	1
judgments	1
upon	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
many	1
women:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
playing	1
the	1
harlot,	1
and	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
give	1
no	1
hire	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
16:42	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
fury	1
toward	1
thee	1
to	1
rest,	1
and	1
my	1
jealousy	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
angry.	1
	1
16:43	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
but	1
hast	1
fretted	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things;	1
behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
recompense	1
thy	1
way	1
upon	1
thine	1
head,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
this	1
lewdness	1
above	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations.	1
	1
16:44	1
Behold,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
useth	1
proverbs	1
shall	1
use	1
this	1
proverb	1
against	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
As	1
is	1
the	1
mother,	1
so	1
is	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
16:45	1
Thou	1
art	1
thy	1
mother's	1
daughter,	1
that	1
lotheth	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
her	1
children;	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
thy	1
sisters,	1
which	1
lothed	1
their	1
husbands	1
and	1
their	1
children:	1
your	1
mother	1
was	1
an	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
your	1
father	1
an	1
Amorite.	1
	1
16:46	1
And	1
thine	1
elder	1
sister	1
is	1
Samaria,	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
thy	1
left	1
hand:	1
and	1
thy	1
younger	1
sister,	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
at	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
is	1
Sodom	1
and	1
her	1
daughters.	1
	1
16:47	1
Yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
walked	1
after	1
their	1
ways,	1
nor	1
done	1
after	1
their	1
abominations:	1
but,	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
thing,	1
thou	1
wast	1
corrupted	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
ways.	1
	1
16:48	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
Sodom	1
thy	1
sister	1
hath	1
not	1
done,	1
she	1
nor	1
her	1
daughters,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters.	1
	1
16:49	1
Behold,	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
sister	1
Sodom,	1
pride,	1
fulness	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
abundance	1
of	1
idleness	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
daughters,	1
neither	1
did	1
she	1
strengthen	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy.	1
	1
16:50	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
haughty,	1
and	1
committed	1
abomination	1
before	1
me:	1
therefore	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
away	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
good.	1
	1
16:51	1
Neither	1
hath	1
Samaria	1
committed	1
half	1
of	1
thy	1
sins;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
thine	1
abominations	1
more	1
than	1
they,	1
and	1
hast	1
justified	1
thy	1
sisters	1
in	1
all	1
thine	1
abominations	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done.	1
	1
16:52	1
Thou	1
also,	1
which	1
hast	1
judged	1
thy	1
sisters,	1
bear	1
thine	1
own	1
shame	1
for	1
thy	1
sins	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
committed	1
more	1
abominable	1
than	1
they:	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
thou:	1
yea,	1
be	1
thou	1
confounded	1
also,	1
and	1
bear	1
thy	1
shame,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
justified	1
thy	1
sisters.	1
	1
16:53	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
their	1
captivity,	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
and	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Samaria	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
thy	1
captives	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them:	1
16:54	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bear	1
thine	1
own	1
shame,	1
and	1
mayest	1
be	1
confounded	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
comfort	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
16:55	1
When	1
thy	1
sisters,	1
Sodom	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
estate,	1
and	1
Samaria	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
estate,	1
then	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
former	1
estate.	1
	1
16:56	1
For	1
thy	1
sister	1
Sodom	1
was	1
not	1
mentioned	1
by	1
thy	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
pride,	1
16:57	1
Before	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
was	1
discovered,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
reproach	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
her,	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
which	1
despise	1
thee	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
16:58	1
Thou	1
hast	1
borne	1
thy	1
lewdness	1
and	1
thine	1
abominations,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:59	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
deal	1
with	1
thee	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
which	1
hast	1
despised	1
the	1
oath	1
in	1
breaking	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
16:60	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
unto	1
thee	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
16:61	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
remember	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
thy	1
sisters,	1
thine	1
elder	1
and	1
thy	1
younger:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
daughters,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
16:62	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
16:63	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
remember,	1
and	1
be	1
confounded,	1
and	1
never	1
open	1
thy	1
mouth	1
any	1
more	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
shame,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
pacified	1
toward	1
thee	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
17:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
riddle,	1
and	1
speak	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
17:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
A	1
great	1
eagle	1
with	1
great	1
wings,	1
longwinged,	1
full	1
of	1
feathers,	1
which	1
had	1
divers	1
colours,	1
came	1
unto	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
highest	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
cedar:	1
17:4	1
He	1
cropped	1
off	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
twigs,	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
traffick;	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
merchants.	1
	1
17:5	1
He	1
took	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
planted	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
fruitful	1
field;	1
he	1
placed	1
it	1
by	1
great	1
waters,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
willow	1
tree.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
it	1
grew,	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
spreading	1
vine	1
of	1
low	1
stature,	1
whose	1
branches	1
turned	1
toward	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
were	1
under	1
him:	1
so	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
vine,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
branches,	1
and	1
shot	1
forth	1
sprigs.	1
	1
17:7	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
another	1
great	1
eagle	1
with	1
great	1
wings	1
and	1
many	1
feathers:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
this	1
vine	1
did	1
bend	1
her	1
roots	1
toward	1
him,	1
and	1
shot	1
forth	1
her	1
branches	1
toward	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
water	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
her	1
plantation.	1
	1
17:8	1
It	1
was	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
soil	1
by	1
great	1
waters,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
bring	1
forth	1
branches,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
bear	1
fruit,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
goodly	1
vine.	1
	1
17:9	1
Say	1
thou,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Shall	1
it	1
prosper?	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
pull	1
up	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
that	1
it	1
wither?	1
it	1
shall	1
wither	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
her	1
spring,	1
even	1
without	1
great	1
power	1
or	1
many	1
people	1
to	1
pluck	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof.	1
	1
17:10	1
Yea,	1
behold,	1
being	1
planted,	1
shall	1
it	1
prosper?	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
utterly	1
wither,	1
when	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
toucheth	1
it?	1
it	1
shall	1
wither	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
where	1
it	1
grew.	1
	1
17:11	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
17:12	1
Say	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
rebellious	1
house,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean?	1
	1
tell	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
hath	1
taken	1
the	1
king	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof,	1
and	1
led	1
them	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
17:13	1
And	1
hath	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
seed,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
hath	1
taken	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
him:	1
he	1
hath	1
also	1
taken	1
the	1
mighty	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
17:14	1
That	1
the	1
kingdom	1
might	1
be	1
base,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
lift	1
itself	1
up,	1
but	1
that	1
by	1
keeping	1
of	1
his	1
covenant	1
it	1
might	1
stand.	1
	1
17:15	1
But	1
he	1
rebelled	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
sending	1
his	1
ambassadors	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
him	1
horses	1
and	1
much	1
people.	1
Shall	1
he	1
prosper?	1
shall	1
he	1
escape	1
that	1
doeth	1
such	1
things?	1
or	1
shall	1
he	1
break	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
be	1
delivered?	1
	1
17:16	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
surely	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
king	1
dwelleth	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
king,	1
whose	1
oath	1
he	1
despised,	1
and	1
whose	1
covenant	1
he	1
brake,	1
even	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Babylon	1
he	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
17:17	1
Neither	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
army	1
and	1
great	1
company	1
make	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
war,	1
by	1
casting	1
up	1
mounts,	1
and	1
building	1
forts,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
many	1
persons:	1
17:18	1
Seeing	1
he	1
despised	1
the	1
oath	1
by	1
breaking	1
the	1
covenant,	1
when,	1
lo,	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
17:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
surely	1
mine	1
oath	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
despised,	1
and	1
my	1
covenant	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
broken,	1
even	1
it	1
will	1
I	1
recompense	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
my	1
net	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
my	1
snare,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
for	1
his	1
trespass	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
17:21	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
fugitives	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
bands	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
remain	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
toward	1
all	1
winds:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
17:22	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
cedar,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
crop	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
twigs	1
a	1
tender	1
one,	1
and	1
will	1
plant	1
it	1
upon	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
and	1
eminent:	1
17:23	1
In	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
I	1
plant	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
boughs,	1
and	1
bear	1
fruit,	1
and	1
be	1
a	1
goodly	1
cedar:	1
and	1
under	1
it	1
shall	1
dwell	1
all	1
fowl	1
of	1
every	1
wing;	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
shall	1
they	1
dwell.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
tree,	1
have	1
exalted	1
the	1
low	1
tree,	1
have	1
dried	1
up	1
the	1
green	1
tree,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
dry	1
tree	1
to	1
flourish:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
it.	1
	1
18:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
saying,	1
18:2	1
What	1
mean	1
ye,	1
that	1
ye	1
use	1
this	1
proverb	1
concerning	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
fathers	1
have	1
eaten	1
sour	1
grapes,	1
and	1
the	1
children's	1
teeth	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
edge?	1
	1
18:3	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
occasion	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
use	1
this	1
proverb	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:4	1
Behold,	1
all	1
souls	1
are	1
mine;	1
as	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
father,	1
so	1
also	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
is	1
mine:	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
sinneth,	1
it	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
18:5	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
just,	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right,	1
18:6	1
And	1
hath	1
not	1
eaten	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
neither	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
hath	1
defiled	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
neither	1
hath	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
a	1
menstruous	1
woman,	1
18:7	1
And	1
hath	1
not	1
oppressed	1
any,	1
but	1
hath	1
restored	1
to	1
the	1
debtor	1
his	1
pledge,	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
none	1
by	1
violence,	1
hath	1
given	1
his	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
hath	1
covered	1
the	1
naked	1
with	1
a	1
garment;	1
18:8	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
forth	1
upon	1
usury,	1
neither	1
hath	1
taken	1
any	1
increase,	1
that	1
hath	1
withdrawn	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
iniquity,	1
hath	1
executed	1
true	1
judgment	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
man,	1
18:9	1
Hath	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
hath	1
kept	1
my	1
judgments,	1
to	1
deal	1
truly;	1
he	1
is	1
just,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
18:10	1
If	1
he	1
beget	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
robber,	1
a	1
shedder	1
of	1
blood,	1
and	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
like	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
18:11	1
And	1
that	1
doeth	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
duties,	1
but	1
even	1
hath	1
eaten	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
defiled	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
18:12	1
Hath	1
oppressed	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy,	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
by	1
violence,	1
hath	1
not	1
restored	1
the	1
pledge,	1
and	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
idols,	1
hath	1
committed	1
abomination,	1
18:13	1
Hath	1
given	1
forth	1
upon	1
usury,	1
and	1
hath	1
taken	1
increase:	1
shall	1
he	1
then	1
live?	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
live:	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
abominations;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die;	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
18:14	1
Now,	1
lo,	1
if	1
he	1
beget	1
a	1
son,	1
that	1
seeth	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
sins	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
and	1
considereth,	1
and	1
doeth	1
not	1
such	1
like,	1
18:15	1
That	1
hath	1
not	1
eaten	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
neither	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hath	1
not	1
defiled	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
18:16	1
Neither	1
hath	1
oppressed	1
any,	1
hath	1
not	1
withholden	1
the	1
pledge,	1
neither	1
hath	1
spoiled	1
by	1
violence,	1
but	1
hath	1
given	1
his	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
hungry,	1
and	1
hath	1
covered	1
the	1
naked	1
with	1
a	1
garment,	1
18:17	1
That	1
hath	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
poor,	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
received	1
usury	1
nor	1
increase,	1
hath	1
executed	1
my	1
judgments,	1
hath	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
statutes;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live.	1
	1
18:18	1
As	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
because	1
he	1
cruelly	1
oppressed,	1
spoiled	1
his	1
brother	1
by	1
violence,	1
and	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
among	1
his	1
people,	1
lo,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
18:19	1
Yet	1
say	1
ye,	1
Why?	1
doth	1
not	1
the	1
son	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
father?	1
	1
When	1
the	1
son	1
hath	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right,	1
and	1
hath	1
kept	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
them,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live.	1
	1
18:20	1
The	1
soul	1
that	1
sinneth,	1
it	1
shall	1
die.	1
The	1
son	1
shall	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
father,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
father	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
son:	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
18:21	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
wicked	1
will	1
turn	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
sins	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed,	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
18:22	1
All	1
his	1
transgressions	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
mentioned	1
unto	1
him:	1
in	1
his	1
righteousness	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
he	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
18:23	1
Have	1
I	1
any	1
pleasure	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
should	1
die?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
from	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
live?	1
18:24	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
righteous	1
turneth	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
committeth	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
doeth	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
man	1
doeth,	1
shall	1
he	1
live?	1
All	1
his	1
righteousness	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
mentioned:	1
in	1
his	1
trespass	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
trespassed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
in	1
them	1
shall	1
he	1
die.	1
	1
18:25	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
equal.	1
Hear	1
now,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Is	1
not	1
my	1
way	1
equal?	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
ways	1
unequal?	1
	1
18:26	1
When	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
turneth	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
committeth	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
dieth	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
he	1
die.	1
	1
18:27	1
Again,	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
man	1
turneth	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed,	1
and	1
doeth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right,	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
his	1
soul	1
alive.	1
	1
18:28	1
Because	1
he	1
considereth,	1
and	1
turneth	1
away	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
transgressions	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
18:29	1
Yet	1
saith	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
equal.	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
ways	1
equal?	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
ways	1
unequal?	1
18:30	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
you,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
Repent,	1
and	1
turn	1
yourselves	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
transgressions;	1
so	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
your	1
ruin.	1
	1
18:31	1
Cast	1
away	1
from	1
you	1
all	1
your	1
transgressions,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
have	1
transgressed;	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
new	1
heart	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
spirit:	1
for	1
why	1
will	1
ye	1
die,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
18:32	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
dieth,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
wherefore	1
turn	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
live	1
ye.	1
	1
19:1	1
Moreover	1
take	1
thou	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
19:2	1
And	1
say,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
mother?	1
A	1
lioness:	1
she	1
lay	1
down	1
among	1
lions,	1
she	1
nourished	1
her	1
whelps	1
among	1
young	1
lions.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
whelps:	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
young	1
lion,	1
and	1
it	1
learned	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
prey;	1
it	1
devoured	1
men.	1
	1
19:4	1
The	1
nations	1
also	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
pit,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
with	1
chains	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
19:5	1
Now	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
waited,	1
and	1
her	1
hope	1
was	1
lost,	1
then	1
she	1
took	1
another	1
of	1
her	1
whelps,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
young	1
lion.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
lions,	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
young	1
lion,	1
and	1
learned	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
devoured	1
men.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
desolate	1
palaces,	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
waste	1
their	1
cities;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof,	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
his	1
roaring.	1
	1
19:8	1
Then	1
the	1
nations	1
set	1
against	1
him	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
from	1
the	1
provinces,	1
and	1
spread	1
their	1
net	1
over	1
him:	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
pit.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
ward	1
in	1
chains,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
holds,	1
that	1
his	1
voice	1
should	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:10	1
Thy	1
mother	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
vine	1
in	1
thy	1
blood,	1
planted	1
by	1
the	1
waters:	1
she	1
was	1
fruitful	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
branches	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
strong	1
rods	1
for	1
the	1
sceptres	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
bare	1
rule,	1
and	1
her	1
stature	1
was	1
exalted	1
among	1
the	1
thick	1
branches,	1
and	1
she	1
appeared	1
in	1
her	1
height	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
her	1
branches.	1
	1
19:12	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
plucked	1
up	1
in	1
fury,	1
she	1
was	1
cast	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
dried	1
up	1
her	1
fruit:	1
her	1
strong	1
rods	1
were	1
broken	1
and	1
withered;	1
the	1
fire	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
thirsty	1
ground.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
fire	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
her	1
branches,	1
which	1
hath	1
devoured	1
her	1
fruit,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
no	1
strong	1
rod	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sceptre	1
to	1
rule.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
lamentation.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
20:3	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
me?	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
enquired	1
of	1
by	1
you.	1
	1
20:4	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
judge	1
them,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
judge	1
them?	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
their	1
fathers:	1
20:5	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
chose	1
Israel,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
made	1
myself	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
when	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
20:6	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
them,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
espied	1
for	1
them,	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
all	1
lands:	1
20:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
them,	1
Cast	1
ye	1
away	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
defile	1
not	1
yourselves	1
with	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:8	1
But	1
they	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
every	1
man	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
their	1
eyes,	1
neither	1
did	1
they	1
forsake	1
the	1
idols	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
them,	1
to	1
accomplish	1
my	1
anger	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
20:9	1
But	1
I	1
wrought	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
polluted	1
before	1
the	1
heathen,	1
among	1
whom	1
they	1
were,	1
in	1
whose	1
sight	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
known	1
unto	1
them,	1
in	1
bringing	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
20:10	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
my	1
judgments,	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
live	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
Moreover	1
also	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
But	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
they	1
despised	1
my	1
judgments,	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
live	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
my	1
sabbaths	1
they	1
greatly	1
polluted:	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
consume	1
them.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
I	1
wrought	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
polluted	1
before	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
whose	1
sight	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
20:15	1
Yet	1
also	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
hand	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
them,	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
all	1
lands;	1
20:16	1
Because	1
they	1
despised	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
but	1
polluted	1
my	1
sabbaths:	1
for	1
their	1
heart	1
went	1
after	1
their	1
idols.	1
	1
20:17	1
Nevertheless	1
mine	1
eye	1
spared	1
them	1
from	1
destroying	1
them,	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
20:18	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
their	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Walk	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
neither	1
observe	1
their	1
judgments,	1
nor	1
defile	1
yourselves	1
with	1
their	1
idols:	1
20:19	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
20:20	1
And	1
hallow	1
my	1
sabbaths;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:21	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
children	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me:	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
neither	1
kept	1
my	1
judgments	1
to	1
do	1
them,	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
live	1
in	1
them;	1
they	1
polluted	1
my	1
sabbaths:	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
them,	1
to	1
accomplish	1
my	1
anger	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
20:22	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
withdrew	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
wrought	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
polluted	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
whose	1
sight	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
forth.	1
	1
20:23	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
them	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
scatter	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
disperse	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
countries;	1
20:24	1
Because	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
executed	1
my	1
judgments,	1
but	1
had	1
despised	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
had	1
polluted	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
after	1
their	1
fathers'	1
idols.	1
	1
20:25	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
also	1
statutes	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
good,	1
and	1
judgments	1
whereby	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
live;	1
20:26	1
And	1
I	1
polluted	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
gifts,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
caused	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire	1
all	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
them	1
desolate,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:27	1
Therefore,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
your	1
fathers	1
have	1
blasphemed	1
me,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
20:28	1
For	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
then	1
they	1
saw	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
thick	1
trees,	1
and	1
they	1
offered	1
there	1
their	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
presented	1
the	1
provocation	1
of	1
their	1
offering:	1
there	1
also	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
there	1
their	1
drink	1
offerings.	1
	1
20:29	1
Then	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
go?	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
whereof	1
is	1
called	1
Bamah	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
20:30	1
Wherefore	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Are	1
ye	1
polluted	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
and	1
commit	1
ye	1
whoredom	1
after	1
their	1
abominations?	1
	1
20:31	1
For	1
when	1
ye	1
offer	1
your	1
gifts,	1
when	1
ye	1
make	1
your	1
sons	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
ye	1
pollute	1
yourselves	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
idols,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
enquired	1
of	1
by	1
you,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
enquired	1
of	1
by	1
you.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
into	1
your	1
mind	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
all,	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
heathen,	1
as	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
countries,	1
to	1
serve	1
wood	1
and	1
stone.	1
	1
20:33	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
surely	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
fury	1
poured	1
out,	1
will	1
I	1
rule	1
over	1
you:	1
20:34	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countries	1
wherein	1
ye	1
are	1
scattered,	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
fury	1
poured	1
out.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
plead	1
with	1
you	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
	1
20:36	1
Like	1
as	1
I	1
pleaded	1
with	1
your	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
plead	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
pass	1
under	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
the	1
covenant:	1
20:38	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
purge	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
the	1
rebels,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
transgress	1
against	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
where	1
they	1
sojourn,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:39	1
As	1
for	1
you,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Go	1
ye,	1
serve	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
idols,	1
and	1
hereafter	1
also,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
but	1
pollute	1
ye	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
your	1
gifts,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
idols.	1
	1
20:40	1
For	1
in	1
mine	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
there	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
serve	1
me:	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
accept	1
them,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
your	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
your	1
oblations,	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
holy	1
things.	1
	1
20:41	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
when	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
gather	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countries	1
wherein	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
scattered;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
20:42	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
20:43	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
remember	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
doings,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
defiled;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
lothe	1
yourselves	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
sight	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
evils	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
20:44	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
wrought	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
wicked	1
ways,	1
nor	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
corrupt	1
doings,	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
20:45	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
20:46	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
drop	1
thy	1
word	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
field;	1
20:47	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
south,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
every	1
green	1
tree	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
every	1
dry	1
tree:	1
the	1
flaming	1
flame	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched,	1
and	1
all	1
faces	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
therein.	1
	1
20:48	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
kindled	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
20:49	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Ah	1
Lord	1
GOD!	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
me,	1
Doth	1
he	1
not	1
speak	1
parables?	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
21:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
toward	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
drop	1
thy	1
word	1
toward	1
the	1
holy	1
places,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
21:3	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
draw	1
forth	1
my	1
sword	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sheath,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
thee	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
21:4	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
thee	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked,	1
therefore	1
shall	1
my	1
sword	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sheath	1
against	1
all	1
flesh	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
to	1
the	1
north:	1
21:5	1
That	1
all	1
flesh	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
drawn	1
forth	1
my	1
sword	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sheath:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
21:6	1
Sigh	1
therefore,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
thy	1
loins;	1
and	1
with	1
bitterness	1
sigh	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Wherefore	1
sighest	1
thou?	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
answer,	1
For	1
the	1
tidings;	1
because	1
it	1
cometh:	1
and	1
every	1
heart	1
shall	1
melt,	1
and	1
all	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
feeble,	1
and	1
every	1
spirit	1
shall	1
faint,	1
and	1
all	1
knees	1
shall	1
be	1
weak	1
as	1
water:	1
behold,	1
it	1
cometh,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
21:8	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
21:9	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Say,	1
A	1
sword,	1
a	1
sword	1
is	1
sharpened,	1
and	1
also	1
furbished:	1
21:10	1
It	1
is	1
sharpened	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sore	1
slaughter;	1
it	1
is	1
furbished	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
glitter:	1
should	1
we	1
then	1
make	1
mirth?	1
it	1
contemneth	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
my	1
son,	1
as	1
every	1
tree.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
furbished,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
handled:	1
this	1
sword	1
is	1
sharpened,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
furbished,	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
slayer.	1
	1
21:12	1
Cry	1
and	1
howl,	1
son	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
my	1
people,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel:	1
terrors	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
my	1
people:	1
smite	1
therefore	1
upon	1
thy	1
thigh.	1
	1
21:13	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trial,	1
and	1
what	1
if	1
the	1
sword	1
contemn	1
even	1
the	1
rod?	1
	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
21:14	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
smite	1
thine	1
hands	1
together.	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
sword	1
be	1
doubled	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
slain:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
slain,	1
which	1
entereth	1
into	1
their	1
privy	1
chambers.	1
	1
21:15	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
against	1
all	1
their	1
gates,	1
that	1
their	1
heart	1
may	1
faint,	1
and	1
their	1
ruins	1
be	1
multiplied:	1
ah!	1
it	1
is	1
made	1
bright,	1
it	1
is	1
wrapped	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
21:16	1
Go	1
thee	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
other,	1
either	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
whithersoever	1
thy	1
face	1
is	1
set.	1
	1
21:17	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
smite	1
mine	1
hands	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
my	1
fury	1
to	1
rest:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
said	1
it.	1
	1
21:18	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
saying,	1
21:19	1
Also,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
appoint	1
thee	1
two	1
ways,	1
that	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
may	1
come:	1
both	1
twain	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
land:	1
and	1
choose	1
thou	1
a	1
place,	1
choose	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
21:20	1
Appoint	1
a	1
way,	1
that	1
the	1
sword	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
Rabbath	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
to	1
Judah	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
defenced.	1
	1
21:21	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
parting	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ways,	1
to	1
use	1
divination:	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
arrows	1
bright,	1
he	1
consulted	1
with	1
images,	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
liver.	1
	1
21:22	1
At	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
the	1
divination	1
for	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
appoint	1
captains,	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
slaughter,	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
voice	1
with	1
shouting,	1
to	1
appoint	1
battering	1
rams	1
against	1
the	1
gates,	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
fort.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
false	1
divination	1
in	1
their	1
sight,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
sworn	1
oaths:	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
iniquity,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
taken.	1
	1
21:24	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
iniquity	1
to	1
be	1
remembered,	1
in	1
that	1
your	1
transgressions	1
are	1
discovered,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
doings	1
your	1
sins	1
do	1
appear;	1
because,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
remembrance,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
thou,	1
profane	1
wicked	1
prince	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whose	1
day	1
is	1
come,	1
when	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
end,	1
21:26	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Remove	1
the	1
diadem,	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
crown:	1
this	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
same:	1
exalt	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
low,	1
and	1
abase	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
high.	1
	1
21:27	1
I	1
will	1
overturn,	1
overturn,	1
overturn,	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more,	1
until	1
he	1
come	1
whose	1
right	1
it	1
is;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
him.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
thou,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
concerning	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
concerning	1
their	1
reproach;	1
even	1
say	1
thou,	1
The	1
sword,	1
the	1
sword	1
is	1
drawn:	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter	1
it	1
is	1
furbished,	1
to	1
consume	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
glittering:	1
21:29	1
Whiles	1
they	1
see	1
vanity	1
unto	1
thee,	1
whiles	1
they	1
divine	1
a	1
lie	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
bring	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain,	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
whose	1
day	1
is	1
come,	1
when	1
their	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
21:30	1
Shall	1
I	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
sheath?	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
wast	1
created,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
nativity.	1
	1
21:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
mine	1
indignation	1
upon	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
blow	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
wrath,	1
and	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
brutish	1
men,	1
and	1
skilful	1
to	1
destroy.	1
	1
21:32	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
for	1
fuel	1
to	1
the	1
fire;	1
thy	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
remembered:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
22:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
22:2	1
Now,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
judge,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
judge	1
the	1
bloody	1
city?	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
abominations.	1
	1
22:3	1
Then	1
say	1
thou,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
The	1
city	1
sheddeth	1
blood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
her	1
time	1
may	1
come,	1
and	1
maketh	1
idols	1
against	1
herself	1
to	1
defile	1
herself.	1
	1
22:4	1
Thou	1
art	1
become	1
guilty	1
in	1
thy	1
blood	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shed;	1
and	1
hast	1
defiled	1
thyself	1
in	1
thine	1
idols	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
caused	1
thy	1
days	1
to	1
draw	1
near,	1
and	1
art	1
come	1
even	1
unto	1
thy	1
years:	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
a	1
mocking	1
to	1
all	1
countries.	1
	1
22:5	1
Those	1
that	1
be	1
near,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
shall	1
mock	1
thee,	1
which	1
art	1
infamous	1
and	1
much	1
vexed.	1
	1
22:6	1
Behold,	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
every	1
one	1
were	1
in	1
thee	1
to	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
shed	1
blood.	1
	1
22:7	1
In	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
set	1
light	1
by	1
father	1
and	1
mother:	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
dealt	1
by	1
oppression	1
with	1
the	1
stranger:	1
in	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
vexed	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
the	1
widow.	1
	1
22:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
despised	1
mine	1
holy	1
things,	1
and	1
hast	1
profaned	1
my	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
22:9	1
In	1
thee	1
are	1
men	1
that	1
carry	1
tales	1
to	1
shed	1
blood:	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
they	1
eat	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains:	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
they	1
commit	1
lewdness.	1
	1
22:10	1
In	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
discovered	1
their	1
fathers'	1
nakedness:	1
in	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
humbled	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
pollution.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
one	1
hath	1
committed	1
abomination	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife;	1
and	1
another	1
hath	1
lewdly	1
defiled	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law;	1
and	1
another	1
in	1
thee	1
hath	1
humbled	1
his	1
sister,	1
his	1
father's	1
daughter.	1
	1
22:12	1
In	1
thee	1
have	1
they	1
taken	1
gifts	1
to	1
shed	1
blood;	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
usury	1
and	1
increase,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
greedily	1
gained	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbours	1
by	1
extortion,	1
and	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
22:13	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
smitten	1
mine	1
hand	1
at	1
thy	1
dishonest	1
gain	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made,	1
and	1
at	1
thy	1
blood	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
22:14	1
Can	1
thine	1
heart	1
endure,	1
or	1
can	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
strong,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
deal	1
with	1
thee?	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
disperse	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
countries,	1
and	1
will	1
consume	1
thy	1
filthiness	1
out	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
thine	1
inheritance	1
in	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
22:18	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
become	1
dross:	1
all	1
they	1
are	1
brass,	1
and	1
tin,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
lead,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
furnace;	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
the	1
dross	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
22:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
become	1
dross,	1
behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
22:20	1
As	1
they	1
gather	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
lead,	1
and	1
tin,	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
to	1
blow	1
the	1
fire	1
upon	1
it,	1
to	1
melt	1
it;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
you	1
in	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
you	1
there,	1
and	1
melt	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
Yea,	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
you,	1
and	1
blow	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
wrath,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
therof.	1
	1
22:22	1
As	1
silver	1
is	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
melted	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
22:24	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
cleansed,	1
nor	1
rained	1
upon	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
indignation.	1
	1
22:25	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
of	1
her	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
like	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion	1
ravening	1
the	1
prey;	1
they	1
have	1
devoured	1
souls;	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
treasure	1
and	1
precious	1
things;	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
many	1
widows	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
22:26	1
Her	1
priests	1
have	1
violated	1
my	1
law,	1
and	1
have	1
profaned	1
mine	1
holy	1
things:	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
holy	1
and	1
profane,	1
neither	1
have	1
they	1
shewed	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean,	1
and	1
have	1
hid	1
their	1
eyes	1
from	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
profaned	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
22:27	1
Her	1
princes	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
are	1
like	1
wolves	1
ravening	1
the	1
prey,	1
to	1
shed	1
blood,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
souls,	1
to	1
get	1
dishonest	1
gain.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
her	1
prophets	1
have	1
daubed	1
them	1
with	1
untempered	1
morter,	1
seeing	1
vanity,	1
and	1
divining	1
lies	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
spoken.	1
	1
22:29	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
have	1
used	1
oppression,	1
and	1
exercised	1
robbery,	1
and	1
have	1
vexed	1
the	1
poor	1
and	1
needy:	1
yea,	1
they	1
have	1
oppressed	1
the	1
stranger	1
wrongfully.	1
	1
22:30	1
And	1
I	1
sought	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
them,	1
that	1
should	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
hedge,	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
gap	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
destroy	1
it:	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
22:31	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
poured	1
out	1
mine	1
indignation	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
wrath:	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
have	1
I	1
recompensed	1
upon	1
their	1
heads,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
23:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
23:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
women,	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
one	1
mother:	1
23:3	1
And	1
they	1
committed	1
whoredoms	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
they	1
committed	1
whoredoms	1
in	1
their	1
youth:	1
there	1
were	1
their	1
breasts	1
pressed,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
bruised	1
the	1
teats	1
of	1
their	1
virginity.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
Aholah	1
the	1
elder,	1
and	1
Aholibah	1
her	1
sister:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
mine,	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters.	1
Thus	1
were	1
their	1
names;	1
Samaria	1
is	1
Aholah,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
Aholibah.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
Aholah	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
mine;	1
and	1
she	1
doted	1
on	1
her	1
lovers,	1
on	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
her	1
neighbours,	1
23:6	1
Which	1
were	1
clothed	1
with	1
blue,	1
captains	1
and	1
rulers,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
desirable	1
young	1
men,	1
horsemen	1
riding	1
upon	1
horses.	1
	1
23:7	1
Thus	1
she	1
committed	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
with	1
them,	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
on	1
whom	1
she	1
doted:	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
idols	1
she	1
defiled	1
herself.	1
	1
23:8	1
Neither	1
left	1
she	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
brought	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
in	1
her	1
youth	1
they	1
lay	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
bruised	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
her	1
virginity,	1
and	1
poured	1
their	1
whoredom	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
23:9	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
upon	1
whom	1
she	1
doted.	1
	1
23:10	1
These	1
discovered	1
her	1
nakedness:	1
they	1
took	1
her	1
sons	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
and	1
slew	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
famous	1
among	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
executed	1
judgment	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
sister	1
Aholibah	1
saw	1
this,	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
corrupt	1
in	1
her	1
inordinate	1
love	1
than	1
she,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
more	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
in	1
her	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
23:12	1
She	1
doted	1
upon	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
her	1
neighbours,	1
captains	1
and	1
rulers	1
clothed	1
most	1
gorgeously,	1
horsemen	1
riding	1
upon	1
horses,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
desirable	1
young	1
men.	1
	1
23:13	1
Then	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
defiled,	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
both	1
one	1
way,	1
23:14	1
And	1
that	1
she	1
increased	1
her	1
whoredoms:	1
for	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
men	1
pourtrayed	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
pourtrayed	1
with	1
vermilion,	1
23:15	1
Girded	1
with	1
girdles	1
upon	1
their	1
loins,	1
exceeding	1
in	1
dyed	1
attire	1
upon	1
their	1
heads,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
princes	1
to	1
look	1
to,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Babylonians	1
of	1
Chaldea,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
nativity:	1
23:16	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
eyes,	1
she	1
doted	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
them	1
into	1
Chaldea.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
the	1
Babylonians	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
they	1
defiled	1
her	1
with	1
their	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
polluted	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
alienated	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
23:18	1
So	1
she	1
discovered	1
her	1
whoredoms,	1
and	1
discovered	1
her	1
nakedness:	1
then	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
alienated	1
from	1
her,	1
like	1
as	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
alienated	1
from	1
her	1
sister.	1
	1
23:19	1
Yet	1
she	1
multiplied	1
her	1
whoredoms,	1
in	1
calling	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
youth,	1
wherein	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
the	1
harlot	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
23:20	1
For	1
she	1
doted	1
upon	1
their	1
paramours,	1
whose	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
asses,	1
and	1
whose	1
issue	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
horses.	1
	1
23:21	1
Thus	1
thou	1
calledst	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
lewdness	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
in	1
bruising	1
thy	1
teats	1
by	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
for	1
the	1
paps	1
of	1
thy	1
youth.	1
	1
23:22	1
Therefore,	1
O	1
Aholibah,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
thy	1
lovers	1
against	1
thee,	1
from	1
whom	1
thy	1
mind	1
is	1
alienated,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
against	1
thee	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
23:23	1
The	1
Babylonians,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
Pekod,	1
and	1
Shoa,	1
and	1
Koa,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
with	1
them:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
desirable	1
young	1
men,	1
captains	1
and	1
rulers,	1
great	1
lords	1
and	1
renowned,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
riding	1
upon	1
horses.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
thee	1
with	1
chariots,	1
wagons,	1
and	1
wheels,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
people,	1
which	1
shall	1
set	1
against	1
thee	1
buckler	1
and	1
shield	1
and	1
helmet	1
round	1
about:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
judgment	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
judge	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
judgments.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
jealousy	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
deal	1
furiously	1
with	1
thee:	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
nose	1
and	1
thine	1
ears;	1
and	1
thy	1
remnant	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters;	1
and	1
thy	1
residue	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
23:26	1
They	1
shall	1
also	1
strip	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
clothes,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
fair	1
jewels.	1
	1
23:27	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thy	1
lewdness	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
whoredom	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
them,	1
nor	1
remember	1
Egypt	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
23:28	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
whom	1
thou	1
hatest,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
whom	1
thy	1
mind	1
is	1
alienated:	1
23:29	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
deal	1
with	1
thee	1
hatefully,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
all	1
thy	1
labour,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
thee	1
naked	1
and	1
bare:	1
and	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
thy	1
whoredoms	1
shall	1
be	1
discovered,	1
both	1
thy	1
lewdness	1
and	1
thy	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
23:30	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
polluted	1
with	1
their	1
idols.	1
	1
23:31	1
Thou	1
hast	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thy	1
sister;	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
her	1
cup	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
23:32	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
drink	1
of	1
thy	1
sister's	1
cup	1
deep	1
and	1
large:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
laughed	1
to	1
scorn	1
and	1
had	1
in	1
derision;	1
it	1
containeth	1
much.	1
	1
23:33	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
drunkenness	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
with	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
astonishment	1
and	1
desolation,	1
with	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
thy	1
sister	1
Samaria.	1
	1
23:34	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
even	1
drink	1
it	1
and	1
suck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
the	1
sherds	1
thereof,	1
and	1
pluck	1
off	1
thine	1
own	1
breasts:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
23:35	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
me,	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
behind	1
thy	1
back,	1
therefore	1
bear	1
thou	1
also	1
thy	1
lewdness	1
and	1
thy	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
23:36	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
moreover	1
unto	1
me;	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
judge	1
Aholah	1
and	1
Aholibah?	1
yea,	1
declare	1
unto	1
them	1
their	1
abominations;	1
23:37	1
That	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
adultery,	1
and	1
blood	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
idols	1
have	1
they	1
committed	1
adultery,	1
and	1
have	1
also	1
caused	1
their	1
sons,	1
whom	1
they	1
bare	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
to	1
devour	1
them.	1
	1
23:38	1
Moreover	1
this	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
defiled	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
have	1
profaned	1
my	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
23:39	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
their	1
idols,	1
then	1
they	1
came	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
into	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
to	1
profane	1
it;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
thus	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
mine	1
house.	1
	1
23:40	1
And	1
furthermore,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
men	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
far,	1
unto	1
whom	1
a	1
messenger	1
was	1
sent;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
they	1
came:	1
for	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
wash	1
thyself,	1
paintedst	1
thy	1
eyes,	1
and	1
deckedst	1
thyself	1
with	1
ornaments,	1
23:41	1
And	1
satest	1
upon	1
a	1
stately	1
bed,	1
and	1
a	1
table	1
prepared	1
before	1
it,	1
whereupon	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
mine	1
incense	1
and	1
mine	1
oil.	1
	1
23:42	1
And	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
multitude	1
being	1
at	1
ease	1
was	1
with	1
her:	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
sort	1
were	1
brought	1
Sabeans	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
which	1
put	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
beautiful	1
crowns	1
upon	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
23:43	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
old	1
in	1
adulteries,	1
Will	1
they	1
now	1
commit	1
whoredoms	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
23:44	1
Yet	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
as	1
they	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
playeth	1
the	1
harlot:	1
so	1
went	1
they	1
in	1
unto	1
Aholah	1
and	1
unto	1
Aholibah,	1
the	1
lewd	1
women.	1
	1
23:45	1
And	1
the	1
righteous	1
men,	1
they	1
shall	1
judge	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
adulteresses,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
women	1
that	1
shed	1
blood;	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
adulteresses,	1
and	1
blood	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
23:46	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
a	1
company	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
and	1
spoiled.	1
	1
23:47	1
And	1
the	1
company	1
shall	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones,	1
and	1
dispatch	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
swords;	1
they	1
shall	1
slay	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
burn	1
up	1
their	1
houses	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
23:48	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
lewdness	1
to	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
all	1
women	1
may	1
be	1
taught	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
your	1
lewdness.	1
	1
23:49	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
recompense	1
your	1
lewdness	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
your	1
idols:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
24:1	1
Again	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
write	1
thee	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
even	1
of	1
this	1
same	1
day:	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
set	1
himself	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
this	1
same	1
day.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
utter	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
the	1
rebellious	1
house,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Set	1
on	1
a	1
pot,	1
set	1
it	1
on,	1
and	1
also	1
pour	1
water	1
into	1
it:	1
24:4	1
Gather	1
the	1
pieces	1
thereof	1
into	1
it,	1
even	1
every	1
good	1
piece,	1
the	1
thigh,	1
and	1
the	1
shoulder;	1
fill	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
choice	1
bones.	1
	1
24:5	1
Take	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
burn	1
also	1
the	1
bones	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
boil	1
well,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
seethe	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
it	1
therein.	1
	1
24:6	1
Wherefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
bloody	1
city,	1
to	1
the	1
pot	1
whose	1
scum	1
is	1
therein,	1
and	1
whose	1
scum	1
is	1
not	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
it!	1
bring	1
it	1
out	1
piece	1
by	1
piece;	1
let	1
no	1
lot	1
fall	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
24:7	1
For	1
her	1
blood	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her;	1
she	1
set	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
rock;	1
she	1
poured	1
it	1
not	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
to	1
cover	1
it	1
with	1
dust;	1
24:8	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
cause	1
fury	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance;	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
her	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
rock,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
covered.	1
	1
24:9	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
bloody	1
city!	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
make	1
the	1
pile	1
for	1
fire	1
great.	1
	1
24:10	1
Heap	1
on	1
wood,	1
kindle	1
the	1
fire,	1
consume	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
spice	1
it	1
well,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
bones	1
be	1
burned.	1
	1
24:11	1
Then	1
set	1
it	1
empty	1
upon	1
the	1
coals	1
thereof,	1
that	1
the	1
brass	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
hot,	1
and	1
may	1
burn,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
filthiness	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
molten	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
scum	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
24:12	1
She	1
hath	1
wearied	1
herself	1
with	1
lies,	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
scum	1
went	1
not	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
her:	1
her	1
scum	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
24:13	1
In	1
thy	1
filthiness	1
is	1
lewdness:	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
purged	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
not	1
purged,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
purged	1
from	1
thy	1
filthiness	1
any	1
more,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
my	1
fury	1
to	1
rest	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
24:14	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
back,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
spare,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
repent;	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
doings,	1
shall	1
they	1
judge	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
24:15	1
Also	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:16	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
behold,	1
I	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
thee	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes	1
with	1
a	1
stroke:	1
yet	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
mourn	1
nor	1
weep,	1
neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
tears	1
run	1
down.	1
	1
24:17	1
Forbear	1
to	1
cry,	1
make	1
no	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
bind	1
the	1
tire	1
of	1
thine	1
head	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
thy	1
shoes	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
cover	1
not	1
thy	1
lips,	1
and	1
eat	1
not	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
24:18	1
So	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
my	1
wife	1
died;	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
commanded.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
to	1
us,	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
so?	1
	1
24:20	1
Then	1
I	1
answered	1
them,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
24:21	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
profane	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
your	1
strength,	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
your	1
soul	1
pitieth;	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
left	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
cover	1
your	1
lips,	1
nor	1
eat	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
your	1
tires	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
your	1
heads,	1
and	1
your	1
shoes	1
upon	1
your	1
feet:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
mourn	1
nor	1
weep;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
pine	1
away	1
for	1
your	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
mourn	1
one	1
toward	1
another.	1
	1
24:24	1
Thus	1
Ezekiel	1
is	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
sign:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
ye	1
do:	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
cometh,	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
24:25	1
Also,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
take	1
from	1
them	1
their	1
strength,	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
their	1
glory,	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
that	1
whereupon	1
they	1
set	1
their	1
minds,	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
24:26	1
That	1
he	1
that	1
escapeth	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
ears?	1
	1
24:27	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
thy	1
mouth	1
be	1
opened	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
escaped,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak,	1
and	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
dumb:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
25:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
them;	1
25:3	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Aha,	1
against	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
profaned;	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
desolate;	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
captivity;	1
25:4	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
set	1
their	1
palaces	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
dwellings	1
in	1
thee:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
thy	1
fruit,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
drink	1
thy	1
milk.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Rabbah	1
a	1
stable	1
for	1
camels,	1
and	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
a	1
couching	1
place	1
for	1
flocks:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
clapped	1
thine	1
hands,	1
and	1
stamped	1
with	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
heart	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
despite	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
25:7	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
thee	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
perish	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
countries:	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:8	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
that	1
Moab	1
and	1
Seir	1
do	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
heathen;	1
25:9	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Moab	1
from	1
the	1
cities,	1
from	1
his	1
cities	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
his	1
frontiers,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
Bethjeshimoth,	1
Baalmeon,	1
and	1
Kiriathaim,	1
25:10	1
Unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
with	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
in	1
possession,	1
that	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
remembered	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
judgments	1
upon	1
Moab;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
that	1
Edom	1
hath	1
dealt	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
by	1
taking	1
vengeance,	1
and	1
hath	1
greatly	1
offended,	1
and	1
revenged	1
himself	1
upon	1
them;	1
25:13	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Edom,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
from	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
desolate	1
from	1
Teman;	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
Dedan	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
my	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
Edom	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
do	1
in	1
Edom	1
according	1
to	1
mine	1
anger	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
fury;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
my	1
vengeance,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
25:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
the	1
Philistines	1
have	1
dealt	1
by	1
revenge,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
vengeance	1
with	1
a	1
despiteful	1
heart,	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
hatred;	1
25:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
Cherethims,	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
coast.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
great	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
them	1
with	1
furious	1
rebukes;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
lay	1
my	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
26:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
because	1
that	1
Tyrus	1
hath	1
said	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
Aha,	1
she	1
is	1
broken	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
she	1
is	1
turned	1
unto	1
me:	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
replenished,	1
now	1
she	1
is	1
laid	1
waste:	1
26:3	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
many	1
nations	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
sea	1
causeth	1
his	1
waves	1
to	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
26:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
break	1
down	1
her	1
towers:	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
scrape	1
her	1
dust	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
like	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
26:5	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
spreading	1
of	1
nets	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
her	1
daughters	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:7	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
Tyrus	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
kings,	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
with	1
horses,	1
and	1
with	1
chariots,	1
and	1
with	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
companies,	1
and	1
much	1
people.	1
	1
26:8	1
He	1
shall	1
slay	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
thy	1
daughters	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
fort	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
mount	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
buckler	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
26:9	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
engines	1
of	1
war	1
against	1
thy	1
walls,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
axes	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
thy	1
towers.	1
	1
26:10	1
By	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
his	1
horses	1
their	1
dust	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee:	1
thy	1
walls	1
shall	1
shake	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chariots,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
thy	1
gates,	1
as	1
men	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
wherein	1
is	1
made	1
a	1
breach.	1
	1
26:11	1
With	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
his	1
horses	1
shall	1
he	1
tread	1
down	1
all	1
thy	1
streets:	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
thy	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
strong	1
garrisons	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
26:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
spoil	1
of	1
thy	1
riches,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
prey	1
of	1
thy	1
merchandise:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
thy	1
walls,	1
and	1
destroy	1
thy	1
pleasant	1
houses:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
thy	1
stones	1
and	1
thy	1
timber	1
and	1
thy	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
26:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
songs	1
to	1
cease;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
thy	1
harps	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
heard.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
like	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
rock:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
spread	1
nets	1
upon;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
built	1
no	1
more:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
26:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
to	1
Tyrus;	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
isles	1
shake	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
thy	1
fall,	1
when	1
the	1
wounded	1
cry,	1
when	1
the	1
slaughter	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee?	1
	1
26:16	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
their	1
thrones,	1
and	1
lay	1
away	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
put	1
off	1
their	1
broidered	1
garments:	1
they	1
shall	1
clothe	1
themselves	1
with	1
trembling;	1
they	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
shall	1
tremble	1
at	1
every	1
moment,	1
and	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
thee.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
How	1
art	1
thou	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
wast	1
inhabited	1
of	1
seafaring	1
men,	1
the	1
renowned	1
city,	1
which	1
wast	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
inhabitants,	1
which	1
cause	1
their	1
terror	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
haunt	1
it!	1
	1
26:18	1
Now	1
shall	1
the	1
isles	1
tremble	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
fall;	1
yea,	1
the	1
isles	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
be	1
troubled	1
at	1
thy	1
departure.	1
	1
26:19	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
desolate	1
city,	1
like	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
inhabited;	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
deep	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
great	1
waters	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee;	1
26:20	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
down	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
pit,	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
low	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
places	1
desolate	1
of	1
old,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit,	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
inhabited;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
set	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living;	1
26:21	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
terror,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
no	1
more:	1
though	1
thou	1
be	1
sought	1
for,	1
yet	1
shalt	1
thou	1
never	1
be	1
found	1
again,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
27:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
27:2	1
Now,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
Tyrus;	1
27:3	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
Tyrus,	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
situate	1
at	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
art	1
a	1
merchant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
many	1
isles,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
O	1
Tyrus,	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
perfect	1
beauty.	1
	1
27:4	1
Thy	1
borders	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas,	1
thy	1
builders	1
have	1
perfected	1
thy	1
beauty.	1
	1
27:5	1
They	1
have	1
made	1
all	1
thy	1
ship	1
boards	1
of	1
fir	1
trees	1
of	1
Senir:	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
cedars	1
from	1
Lebanon	1
to	1
make	1
masts	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
27:6	1
Of	1
the	1
oaks	1
of	1
Bashan	1
have	1
they	1
made	1
thine	1
oars;	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
Ashurites	1
have	1
made	1
thy	1
benches	1
of	1
ivory,	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
Chittim.	1
	1
27:7	1
Fine	1
linen	1
with	1
broidered	1
work	1
from	1
Egypt	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
spreadest	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
sail;	1
blue	1
and	1
purple	1
from	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
Elishah	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
covered	1
thee.	1
	1
27:8	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Zidon	1
and	1
Arvad	1
were	1
thy	1
mariners:	1
thy	1
wise	1
men,	1
O	1
Tyrus,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
thee,	1
were	1
thy	1
pilots.	1
	1
27:9	1
The	1
ancients	1
of	1
Gebal	1
and	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
thereof	1
were	1
in	1
thee	1
thy	1
calkers:	1
all	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
their	1
mariners	1
were	1
in	1
thee	1
to	1
occupy	1
thy	1
merchandise.	1
	1
27:10	1
They	1
of	1
Persia	1
and	1
of	1
Lud	1
and	1
of	1
Phut	1
were	1
in	1
thine	1
army,	1
thy	1
men	1
of	1
war:	1
they	1
hanged	1
the	1
shield	1
and	1
helmet	1
in	1
thee;	1
they	1
set	1
forth	1
thy	1
comeliness.	1
	1
27:11	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Arvad	1
with	1
thine	1
army	1
were	1
upon	1
thy	1
walls	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
Gammadims	1
were	1
in	1
thy	1
towers:	1
they	1
hanged	1
their	1
shields	1
upon	1
thy	1
walls	1
round	1
about;	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
thy	1
beauty	1
perfect.	1
	1
27:12	1
Tarshish	1
was	1
thy	1
merchant	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
kind	1
of	1
riches;	1
with	1
silver,	1
iron,	1
tin,	1
and	1
lead,	1
they	1
traded	1
in	1
thy	1
fairs.	1

of	1
men	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass	1
in	1
thy	1
market.	1
	1
27:14	1

of	1
Togarmah	1
traded	1

horsemen	1
and	1
mules.	1
	1
27:15	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Dedan	1
were	1
thy	1
merchants;	1
many	1
isles	1
were	1
the	1
merchandise	1
of	1
thine	1
hand:	1
they	1
brought	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
horns	1
of	1
ivory	1
and	1
ebony.	1
	1
27:16	1
Syria	1
was	1
thy	1
merchant	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
wares	1
of	1
thy	1
making:	1
they	1
occupied	1
in	1
thy	1
fairs	1
with	1
emeralds,	1
purple,	1
and	1
broidered	1
work,	1
and	1

of	1
Minnith,	1
and	1
Pannag,	1
and	1

	1
27:18	1
Damascus	1
was	1
thy	1
merchant	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
wares	1
of	1
thy	1
making,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
all	1
riches;	1
in	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
Helbon,	1
and	1
white	1
wool.	1
	1
27:19	1
Dan	1
also	1
and	1
Javan	1
going	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
occupied	1
in	1
thy	1
fairs:	1
bright	1
iron,	1
cassia,	1
and	1
calamus,	1
were	1
in	1
thy	1
market.	1
	1
27:20	1
Dedan	1
was	1
thy	1
merchant	1
in	1
precious	1
clothes	1
for	1
chariots.	1
	1
27:21	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Kedar,	1
they	1
occupied	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
lambs,	1
and	1
rams,	1
and	1
goats:	1
in	1
these	1
were	1
they	1
thy	1
merchants.	1
	1
27:22	1
The	1
merchants	1
of	1
Sheba	1
and	1
Raamah,	1
they	1
were	1
thy	1
merchants:	1
they	1
occupied	1
in	1
thy	1
fairs	1
with	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
spices,	1
and	1
with	1

and	1
Eden,	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
Sheba,	1

27:24	1
These	1

thy	1
merchants	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things,	1
in	1
blue	1
clothes,	1
and	1
broidered	1
work,	1
and	1
in	1
chests	1
of	1
rich	1
apparel,	1
bound	1
with	1
cords,	1
and	1
made	1
of	1
cedar,	1
among	1
thy	1
merchandise.	1
	1
27:25	1
The	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
did	1
sing	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
market:	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
replenished,	1
and	1
made	1
very	1
glorious	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas.	1
	1
27:26	1
Thy	1
rowers	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
into	1
great	1
waters:	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
hath	1
broken	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas.	1
	1
27:27	1
Thy	1
riches,	1
and	1
thy	1
fairs,	1
thy	1
merchandise,	1
thy	1
mariners,	1
and	1
thy	1
pilots,	1
thy	1
calkers,	1
and	1
the	1
occupiers	1
of	1
thy	1
merchandise,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
ruin.	1
	1
27:28	1
The	1
suburbs	1
shall	1
shake	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
thy	1
pilots.	1
	1
27:29	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
oar,	1
the	1
mariners,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
pilots	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
their	1
ships,	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
land;	1
27:30	1
And	1
shall	1
cause	1
their	1
voice	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
cry	1
bitterly,	1
and	1
shall	1
cast	1
up	1
dust	1
upon	1
their	1
heads,	1
they	1
shall	1
wallow	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
ashes:	1
27:31	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
themselves	1
utterly	1
bald	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
gird	1
them	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
weep	1
for	1
thee	1
with	1
bitterness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
bitter	1
wailing.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
wailing	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
lament	1
over	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
What	1
city	1
is	1
like	1
Tyrus,	1
like	1
the	1
destroyed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea?	1
	1
27:33	1
When	1
thy	1
wares	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
seas,	1
thou	1
filledst	1
many	1
people;	1
thou	1
didst	1
enrich	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
riches	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
merchandise.	1
	1
27:34	1
In	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
thy	1
merchandise	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
27:35	1
All	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
isles	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
thee,	1
and	1
their	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
sore	1
afraid,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
troubled	1
in	1
their	1
countenance.	1
	1
27:36	1
The	1
merchants	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
hiss	1
at	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
terror,	1
and	1
never	1
shalt	1
be	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
28:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
28:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thine	1
heart	1
is	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
God,	1
I	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
yet	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
God,	1
though	1
thou	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
God:	1
28:3	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
wiser	1
than	1
Daniel;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
secret	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
hide	1
from	1
thee:	1
28:4	1
With	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
and	1
with	1
thine	1
understanding	1
thou	1
hast	1
gotten	1
thee	1
riches,	1
and	1
hast	1
gotten	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
into	1
thy	1
treasures:	1
28:5	1
By	1
thy	1
great	1
wisdom	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
traffick	1
hast	1
thou	1
increased	1
thy	1
riches,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
riches:	1
28:6	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
God;	1
28:7	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
strangers	1
upon	1
thee,	1
the	1
terrible	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
draw	1
their	1
swords	1
against	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
thy	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
defile	1
thy	1
brightness.	1
	1
28:8	1
They	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas.	1
	1
28:9	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
yet	1
say	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
slayeth	1
thee,	1
I	1
am	1
God?	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
no	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
slayeth	1
thee.	1
	1
28:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
strangers:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
28:11	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
28:12	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
upon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Thou	1
sealest	1
up	1
the	1
sum,	1
full	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
perfect	1
in	1
beauty.	1
	1
28:13	1
Thou	1
hast	1
been	1
in	1
Eden	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
God;	1
every	1
precious	1
stone	1
was	1
thy	1
covering,	1
the	1
sardius,	1
topaz,	1
and	1
the	1
diamond,	1
the	1
beryl,	1
the	1
onyx,	1
and	1
the	1
jasper,	1
the	1
sapphire,	1
the	1
emerald,	1
and	1
the	1
carbuncle,	1
and	1
gold:	1
the	1
workmanship	1
of	1
thy	1
tabrets	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
pipes	1
was	1
prepared	1
in	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
created.	1
	1
28:14	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
anointed	1
cherub	1
that	1
covereth;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
so:	1
thou	1
wast	1
upon	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain	1
of	1
God;	1
thou	1
hast	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
28:15	1
Thou	1
wast	1
perfect	1
in	1
thy	1
ways	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
created,	1
till	1
iniquity	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
28:16	1
By	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
merchandise	1
they	1
have	1
filled	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
with	1
violence,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
sinned:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
as	1
profane	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
O	1
covering	1
cherub,	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
28:17	1
Thine	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
beauty,	1
thou	1
hast	1
corrupted	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
thy	1
brightness:	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
thee	1
before	1
kings,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
behold	1
thee.	1
	1
28:18	1
Thou	1
hast	1
defiled	1
thy	1
sanctuaries	1
by	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquities,	1
by	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
traffick;	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
to	1
ashes	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
behold	1
thee.	1
	1
28:19	1
All	1
they	1
that	1
know	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
terror,	1
and	1
never	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
28:20	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
28:21	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
it,	1
28:22	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
Zidon;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
executed	1
judgments	1
in	1
her,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
28:23	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
into	1
her	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
blood	1
into	1
her	1
streets;	1
and	1
the	1
wounded	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
upon	1
her	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
pricking	1
brier	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
nor	1
any	1
grieving	1
thorn	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
them,	1
that	1
despised	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
28:25	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
gathered	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
among	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
scattered,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
my	1
servant	1
Jacob.	1
	1
28:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely	1
therein,	1
and	1
shall	1
build	1
houses,	1
and	1
plant	1
vineyards;	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
confidence,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
executed	1
judgments	1
upon	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
despise	1
them	1
round	1
about	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
29:1	1
In	1
the	1
tenth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
29:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
Egypt:	1
29:3	1
Speak,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
great	1
dragon	1
that	1
lieth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
rivers,	1
which	1
hath	1
said,	1
My	1
river	1
is	1
mine	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
for	1
myself.	1
	1
29:4	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
hooks	1
in	1
thy	1
jaws,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
thy	1
rivers	1
to	1
stick	1
unto	1
thy	1
scales,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
rivers,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
thy	1
rivers	1
shall	1
stick	1
unto	1
thy	1
scales.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
thee	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
thee	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
thy	1
rivers:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
fields;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
together,	1
nor	1
gathered:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
for	1
meat	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven.	1
	1
29:6	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
staff	1
of	1
reed	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:7	1
When	1
they	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
thee	1
by	1
thy	1
hand,	1
thou	1
didst	1
break,	1
and	1
rend	1
all	1
their	1
shoulder:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
leaned	1
upon	1
thee,	1
thou	1
brakest,	1
and	1
madest	1
all	1
their	1
loins	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
stand.	1
	1
29:8	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
out	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
29:9	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
and	1
waste;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
The	1
river	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
it.	1
	1
29:10	1
Behold,	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
against	1
thy	1
rivers,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
utterly	1
waste	1
and	1
desolate,	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Syene	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Ethiopia.	1
	1
29:11	1
No	1
foot	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it,	1
nor	1
foot	1
of	1
beast	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
it,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
inhabited	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
29:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
countries	1
that	1
are	1
desolate,	1
and	1
her	1
cities	1
among	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
laid	1
waste	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
forty	1
years:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
disperse	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
29:13	1
Yet	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
whither	1
they	1
were	1
scattered:	1
29:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Pathros,	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
habitation;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
a	1
base	1
kingdom.	1
	1
29:15	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
basest	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms;	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
exalt	1
itself	1
any	1
more	1
above	1
the	1
nations:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
diminish	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
29:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
their	1
iniquity	1
to	1
remembrance,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
after	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
29:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
29:18	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
caused	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
serve	1
a	1
great	1
service	1
against	1
Tyrus:	1
every	1
head	1
was	1
made	1
bald,	1
and	1
every	1
shoulder	1
was	1
peeled:	1
yet	1
had	1
he	1
no	1
wages,	1
nor	1
his	1
army,	1
for	1
Tyrus,	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
against	1
it:	1
29:19	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
her	1
multitude,	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
spoil,	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
prey;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
wages	1
for	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
29:20	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
his	1
labour	1
wherewith	1
he	1
served	1
against	1
it,	1
because	1
they	1
wrought	1
for	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
29:21	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
bud	1
forth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
30:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Howl	1
ye,	1
Woe	1
worth	1
the	1
day!	1
30:3	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
near,	1
even	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near,	1
a	1
cloudy	1
day;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
great	1
pain	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
Ethiopia,	1
when	1
the	1
slain	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
her	1
multitude,	1
and	1
her	1
foundations	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
down.	1
	1
30:5	1
Ethiopia,	1
and	1
Libya,	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mingled	1
people,	1
and	1
Chub,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
league,	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
30:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
They	1
also	1
that	1
uphold	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
fall;	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
her	1
power	1
shall	1
come	1
down:	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Syene	1
shall	1
they	1
fall	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
countries	1
that	1
are	1
desolate,	1
and	1
her	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
wasted.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
when	1
all	1
her	1
helpers	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
30:9	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
messengers	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
me	1
in	1
ships	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
careless	1
Ethiopians	1
afraid,	1
and	1
great	1
pain	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
it	1
cometh.	1
	1
30:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
cease	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadrezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
30:11	1
He	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
terrible	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
draw	1
their	1
swords	1
against	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
land	1
with	1
the	1
slain.	1
	1
30:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
rivers	1
dry,	1
and	1
sell	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
waste,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
strangers:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
30:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
destroy	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
their	1
images	1
to	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
Noph;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
fear	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Pathros	1
desolate,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
fire	1
in	1
Zoan,	1
and	1
will	1
execute	1
judgments	1
in	1
No.	1
	1
30:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
Sin,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
No.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
fire	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
Sin	1
shall	1
have	1
great	1
pain,	1
and	1
No	1
shall	1
be	1
rent	1
asunder,	1
and	1
Noph	1
shall	1
have	1
distresses	1
daily.	1
	1
30:17	1
The	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
Aven	1
and	1
of	1
Pibeseth	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
and	1
these	1
cities	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
30:18	1
At	1
Tehaphnehes	1
also	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
break	1
there	1
the	1
yokes	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
pomp	1
of	1
her	1
strength	1
shall	1
cease	1
in	1
her:	1
as	1
for	1
her,	1
a	1
cloud	1
shall	1
cover	1
her,	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity.	1
	1
30:19	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
execute	1
judgments	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
30:21	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
bound	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
healed,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
roller	1
to	1
bind	1
it,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
strong	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
30:22	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
will	1
break	1
his	1
arms,	1
the	1
strong,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
broken;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
30:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
disperse	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
30:24	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
Pharaoh's	1
arms,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
groan	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
groanings	1
of	1
a	1
deadly	1
wounded	1
man.	1
	1
30:25	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
fall	1
down;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
my	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stretch	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
30:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
disperse	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
countries;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
31:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
speak	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
multitude;	1
Whom	1
art	1
thou	1
like	1
in	1
thy	1
greatness?	1
	1
31:3	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
was	1
a	1
cedar	1
in	1
Lebanon	1
with	1
fair	1
branches,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shadowing	1
shroud,	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
high	1
stature;	1
and	1
his	1
top	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
thick	1
boughs.	1
	1
31:4	1
The	1
waters	1
made	1
him	1
great,	1
the	1
deep	1
set	1
him	1
up	1
on	1
high	1
with	1
her	1
rivers	1
running	1
round	1
about	1
his	1
plants,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
little	1
rivers	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
31:5	1
Therefore	1
his	1
height	1
was	1
exalted	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
his	1
boughs	1
were	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
his	1
branches	1
became	1
long	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
waters,	1
when	1
he	1
shot	1
forth.	1
	1
31:6	1
All	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven	1
made	1
their	1
nests	1
in	1
his	1
boughs,	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
branches	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
bring	1
forth	1
their	1
young,	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
dwelt	1
all	1
great	1
nations.	1
	1
31:7	1
Thus	1
was	1
he	1
fair	1
in	1
his	1
greatness,	1
in	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
branches:	1
for	1
his	1
root	1
was	1
by	1
great	1
waters.	1
	1
31:8	1
The	1
cedars	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
God	1
could	1
not	1
hide	1
him:	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
were	1
not	1
like	1
his	1
boughs,	1
and	1
the	1
chestnut	1
trees	1
were	1
not	1
like	1
his	1
branches;	1
nor	1
any	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
beauty.	1
	1
31:9	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
fair	1
by	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
branches:	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
Eden,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
God,	1
envied	1
him.	1
	1
31:10	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
lifted	1
up	1
thyself	1
in	1
height,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
shot	1
up	1
his	1
top	1
among	1
the	1
thick	1
boughs,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
height;	1
31:11	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
deal	1
with	1
him:	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
him	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
strangers,	1
the	1
terrible	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
have	1
cut	1
him	1
off,	1
and	1
have	1
left	1
him:	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
valleys	1
his	1
branches	1
are	1
fallen,	1
and	1
his	1
boughs	1
are	1
broken	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
shadow,	1
and	1
have	1
left	1
him.	1
	1
31:13	1
Upon	1
his	1
ruin	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
remain,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
branches:	1
31:14	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
exalt	1
themselves	1
for	1
their	1
height,	1
neither	1
shoot	1
up	1
their	1
top	1
among	1
the	1
thick	1
boughs,	1
neither	1
their	1
trees	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
height,	1
all	1
that	1
drink	1
water:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
delivered	1
unto	1
death,	1
to	1
the	1
nether	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
31:15	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
I	1
caused	1
a	1
mourning:	1
I	1
covered	1
the	1
deep	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
restrained	1
the	1
floods	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
waters	1
were	1
stayed:	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
Lebanon	1
to	1
mourn	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
fainted	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
31:16	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
shake	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
fall,	1
when	1
I	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
pit:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
Eden,	1
the	1
choice	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
all	1
that	1
drink	1
water,	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted	1
in	1
the	1
nether	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
31:17	1
They	1
also	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
hell	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
his	1
arm,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
31:18	1
To	1
whom	1
art	1
thou	1
thus	1
like	1
in	1
glory	1
and	1
in	1
greatness	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
Eden?	1
yet	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
Eden	1
unto	1
the	1
nether	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
This	1
is	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
multitude,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
32:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
32:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
lamentation	1
for	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
like	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
as	1
a	1
whale	1
in	1
the	1
seas:	1
and	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
with	1
thy	1
rivers,	1
and	1
troubledst	1
the	1
waters	1
with	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
fouledst	1
their	1
rivers.	1
	1
32:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
spread	1
out	1
my	1
net	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
many	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
net.	1
	1
32:4	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
leave	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
remain	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
32:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
thy	1
flesh	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
valleys	1
with	1
thy	1
height.	1
	1
32:6	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
water	1
with	1
thy	1
blood	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
swimmest,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
the	1
rivers	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
32:7	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
put	1
thee	1
out,	1
I	1
will	1
cover	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
stars	1
thereof	1
dark;	1
I	1
will	1
cover	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light.	1
	1
32:8	1
All	1
the	1
bright	1
lights	1
of	1
heaven	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
dark	1
over	1
thee,	1
and	1
set	1
darkness	1
upon	1
thy	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
32:9	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
vex	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
thy	1
destruction	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
into	1
the	1
countries	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
32:10	1
Yea,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
many	1
people	1
amazed	1
at	1
thee,	1
and	1
their	1
kings	1
shall	1
be	1
horribly	1
afraid	1
for	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
brandish	1
my	1
sword	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
tremble	1
at	1
every	1
moment,	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
life,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
fall.	1
	1
32:11	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
32:12	1
By	1
the	1
swords	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
thy	1
multitude	1
to	1
fall,	1
the	1
terrible	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
all	1
of	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
pomp	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
32:13	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
thereof	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
great	1
waters;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
man	1
trouble	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
nor	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
beasts	1
trouble	1
them.	1
	1
32:14	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
their	1
waters	1
deep,	1
and	1
cause	1
their	1
rivers	1
to	1
run	1
like	1
oil,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
32:15	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
shall	1
be	1
destitute	1
of	1
that	1
whereof	1
it	1
was	1
full,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
smite	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
lamentation	1
wherewith	1
they	1
shall	1
lament	1
her:	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
shall	1
lament	1
her:	1
they	1
shall	1
lament	1
for	1
her,	1
even	1
for	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
multitude,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
32:17	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
32:18	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
wail	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
down,	1
even	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
nations,	1
unto	1
the	1
nether	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
32:19	1
Whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
pass	1
in	1
beauty?	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
laid	1
with	1
the	1
uncircumcised.	1
	1
32:20	1
They	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
she	1
is	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
sword:	1
draw	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
multitudes.	1
	1
32:21	1
The	1
strong	1
among	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
hell	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
help	1
him:	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
down,	1
they	1
lie	1
uncircumcised,	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
32:22	1
Asshur	1
is	1
there	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
company:	1
his	1
graves	1
are	1
about	1
him:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
slain,	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
32:23	1
Whose	1
graves	1
are	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
her	1
company	1
is	1
round	1
about	1
her	1
grave:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
slain,	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
caused	1
terror	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
32:24	1
There	1
is	1
Elam	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
multitude	1
round	1
about	1
her	1
grave,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
slain,	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
uncircumcised	1
into	1
the	1
nether	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
caused	1
their	1
terror	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living;	1
yet	1
have	1
they	1
borne	1
their	1
shame	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
32:25	1
They	1
have	1
set	1
her	1
a	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
slain	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
multitude:	1
her	1
graves	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
him:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
uncircumcised,	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
though	1
their	1
terror	1
was	1
caused	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
yet	1
have	1
they	1
borne	1
their	1
shame	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit:	1
he	1
is	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
32:26	1
There	1
is	1
Meshech,	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
multitude:	1
her	1
graves	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
him:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
uncircumcised,	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
though	1
they	1
caused	1
their	1
terror	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
lie	1
with	1
the	1
mighty	1
that	1
are	1
fallen	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised,	1
which	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
hell	1
with	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
their	1
swords	1
under	1
their	1
heads,	1
but	1
their	1
iniquities	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
their	1
bones,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
32:28	1
Yea,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
shalt	1
lie	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
32:29	1
There	1
is	1
Edom,	1
her	1
kings,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
princes,	1
which	1
with	1
their	1
might	1
are	1
laid	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
the	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
32:30	1
There	1
be	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
which	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
slain;	1
with	1
their	1
terror	1
they	1
are	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
might;	1
and	1
they	1
lie	1
uncircumcised	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
bear	1
their	1
shame	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
32:31	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
see	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
multitude,	1
even	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
32:32	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
my	1
terror	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
even	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
multitude,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
33:1	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
33:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
sword	1
upon	1
a	1
land,	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
take	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
their	1
coasts,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
for	1
their	1
watchman:	1
33:3	1
If	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
sword	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
he	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
warn	1
the	1
people;	1
33:4	1
Then	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
taketh	1
not	1
warning;	1
if	1
the	1
sword	1
come,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
away,	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
33:5	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
took	1
not	1
warning;	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
warning	1
shall	1
deliver	1
his	1
soul.	1
	1
33:6	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
watchman	1
see	1
the	1
sword	1
come,	1
and	1
blow	1
not	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
not	1
warned;	1
if	1
the	1
sword	1
come,	1
and	1
take	1
any	1
person	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
he	1
is	1
taken	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
at	1
the	1
watchman's	1
hand.	1
	1
33:7	1
So	1
thou,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
a	1
watchman	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
at	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
warn	1
them	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
33:8	1
When	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked,	1
O	1
wicked	1
man,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die;	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
warn	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
his	1
way,	1
that	1
wicked	1
man	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
at	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
33:9	1
Nevertheless,	1
if	1
thou	1
warn	1
the	1
wicked	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
it;	1
if	1
he	1
do	1
not	1
turn	1
from	1
his	1
way,	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
his	1
iniquity;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
33:10	1
Therefore,	1
O	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Thus	1
ye	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
If	1
our	1
transgressions	1
and	1
our	1
sins	1
be	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
pine	1
away	1
in	1
them,	1
how	1
should	1
we	1
then	1
live?	1
	1
33:11	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
wicked;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
wicked	1
turn	1
from	1
his	1
way	1
and	1
live:	1
turn	1
ye,	1
turn	1
ye	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways;	1
for	1
why	1
will	1
ye	1
die,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
33:12	1
Therefore,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
The	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
transgression:	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
fall	1
thereby	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
turneth	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
his	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
sinneth.	1
	1
33:13	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
righteous,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live;	1
if	1
he	1
trust	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
commit	1
iniquity,	1
all	1
his	1
righteousnesses	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
remembered;	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed,	1
he	1
shall	1
die	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
33:14	1
Again,	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
wicked,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die;	1
if	1
he	1
turn	1
from	1
his	1
sin,	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right;	1
33:15	1
If	1
the	1
wicked	1
restore	1
the	1
pledge,	1
give	1
again	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
robbed,	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
life,	1
without	1
committing	1
iniquity;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
33:16	1
None	1
of	1
his	1
sins	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
committed	1
shall	1
be	1
mentioned	1
unto	1
him:	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
live.	1
	1
33:17	1
Yet	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
say,	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
equal:	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
them,	1
their	1
way	1
is	1
not	1
equal.	1
	1
33:18	1
When	1
the	1
righteous	1
turneth	1
from	1
his	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
committeth	1
iniquity,	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
die	1
thereby.	1
	1
33:19	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
wicked	1
turn	1
from	1
his	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lawful	1
and	1
right,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
thereby.	1
	1
33:20	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
equal.	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
you	1
every	1
one	1
after	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
33:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year	1
of	1
our	1
captivity,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
The	1
city	1
is	1
smitten.	1
	1
33:22	1
Now	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
afore	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
escaped	1
came;	1
and	1
had	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
my	1
mouth	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
dumb.	1
	1
33:23	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
33:24	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
they	1
that	1
inhabit	1
those	1
wastes	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
Abraham	1
was	1
one,	1
and	1
he	1
inherited	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
many;	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
given	1
us	1
for	1
inheritance.	1
	1
33:25	1
Wherefore	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Ye	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes	1
toward	1
your	1
idols,	1
and	1
shed	1
blood:	1
and	1
shall	1
ye	1
possess	1
the	1
land?	1
	1
33:26	1
Ye	1
stand	1
upon	1
your	1
sword,	1
ye	1
work	1
abomination,	1
and	1
ye	1
defile	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife:	1
and	1
shall	1
ye	1
possess	1
the	1
land?	1
	1
33:27	1
Say	1
thou	1
thus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
surely	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
wastes	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
to	1
be	1
devoured,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
forts	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
caves	1
shall	1
die	1
of	1
the	1
pestilence.	1
	1
33:28	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
the	1
land	1
most	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
pomp	1
of	1
her	1
strength	1
shall	1
cease;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
that	1
none	1
shall	1
pass	1
through.	1
	1
33:29	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
land	1
most	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
abominations	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
33:30	1
Also,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
still	1
are	1
talking	1
against	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
walls	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
and	1
speak	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
and	1
hear	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
cometh	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:31	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
cometh,	1
and	1
they	1
sit	1
before	1
thee	1
as	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
hear	1
thy	1
words,	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
them:	1
for	1
with	1
their	1
mouth	1
they	1
shew	1
much	1
love,	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
goeth	1
after	1
their	1
covetousness.	1
	1
33:32	1
And,	1
lo,	1
thou	1
art	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
lovely	1
song	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice,	1
and	1
can	1
play	1
well	1
on	1
an	1
instrument:	1
for	1
they	1
hear	1
thy	1
words,	1
but	1
they	1
do	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
33:33	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
(lo,	1
it	1
will	1
come,)	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
hath	1
been	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
34:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
against	1
the	1
shepherds	1
of	1
Israel,	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
unto	1
the	1
shepherds;	1
Woe	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
shepherds	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
do	1
feed	1
themselves!	1
should	1
not	1
the	1
shepherds	1
feed	1
the	1
flocks?	1
	1
34:3	1
Ye	1
eat	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothe	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
wool,	1
ye	1
kill	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
fed:	1
but	1
ye	1
feed	1
not	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
34:4	1
The	1
diseased	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
strengthened,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
healed	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sick,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
bound	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
broken,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
again	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
driven	1
away,	1
neither	1
have	1
ye	1
sought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost;	1
but	1
with	1
force	1
and	1
with	1
cruelty	1
have	1
ye	1
ruled	1
them.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
scattered,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
meat	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
scattered.	1
	1
34:6	1
My	1
sheep	1
wandered	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
high	1
hill:	1
yea,	1
my	1
flock	1
was	1
scattered	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
none	1
did	1
search	1
or	1
seek	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
34:7	1
Therefore,	1
ye	1
shepherds,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
34:8	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
surely	1
because	1
my	1
flock	1
became	1
a	1
prey,	1
and	1
my	1
flock	1
became	1
meat	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shepherd,	1
neither	1
did	1
my	1
shepherds	1
search	1
for	1
my	1
flock,	1
but	1
the	1
shepherds	1
fed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
fed	1
not	1
my	1
flock;	1
34:9	1
Therefore,	1
O	1
ye	1
shepherds,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
34:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
the	1
shepherds;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
require	1
my	1
flock	1
at	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
feeding	1
the	1
flock;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
shepherds	1
feed	1
themselves	1
any	1
more;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
my	1
flock	1
from	1
their	1
mouth,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
34:11	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
both	1
search	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
seek	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
34:12	1
As	1
a	1
shepherd	1
seeketh	1
out	1
his	1
flock	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
among	1
his	1
sheep	1
that	1
are	1
scattered;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
seek	1
out	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
places	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
scattered	1
in	1
the	1
cloudy	1
and	1
dark	1
day.	1
	1
34:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
countries,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
land,	1
and	1
feed	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
inhabited	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
34:14	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
pasture,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
their	1
fold	1
be:	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
fold,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
fat	1
pasture	1
shall	1
they	1
feed	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
34:15	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
my	1
flock,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
lie	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
34:16	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
bring	1
again	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
driven	1
away,	1
and	1
will	1
bind	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
broken,	1
and	1
will	1
strengthen	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sick:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
fat	1
and	1
the	1
strong;	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
with	1
judgment.	1
	1
34:17	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
O	1
my	1
flock,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
judge	1
between	1
cattle	1
and	1
cattle,	1
between	1
the	1
rams	1
and	1
the	1
he	1
goats.	1
	1
34:18	1
Seemeth	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
eaten	1
up	1
the	1
good	1
pasture,	1
but	1
ye	1
must	1
tread	1
down	1
with	1
your	1
feet	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
your	1
pastures?	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
waters,	1
but	1
ye	1
must	1
foul	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
your	1
feet?	1
	1
34:19	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
flock,	1
they	1
eat	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
trodden	1
with	1
your	1
feet;	1
and	1
they	1
drink	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
fouled	1
with	1
your	1
feet.	1
	1
34:20	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
unto	1
them;	1
Behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
judge	1
between	1
the	1
fat	1
cattle	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
lean	1
cattle.	1
	1
34:21	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
thrust	1
with	1
side	1
and	1
with	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
pushed	1
all	1
the	1
diseased	1
with	1
your	1
horns,	1
till	1
ye	1
have	1
scattered	1
them	1
abroad;	1
34:22	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
my	1
flock,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
a	1
prey;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
between	1
cattle	1
and	1
cattle.	1
	1
34:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
one	1
shepherd	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
even	1
my	1
servant	1
David;	1
he	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
shepherd.	1
	1
34:24	1
And	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
David	1
a	1
prince	1
among	1
them;	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
34:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
evil	1
beasts	1
to	1
cease	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
woods.	1
	1
34:26	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
places	1
round	1
about	1
my	1
hill	1
a	1
blessing;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
shower	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
season;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
showers	1
of	1
blessing.	1
	1
34:27	1
And	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
their	1
yoke,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
served	1
themselves	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
34:28	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
the	1
heathen,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
devour	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
34:29	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
plant	1
of	1
renown,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
consumed	1
with	1
hunger	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
neither	1
bear	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
34:30	1
Thus	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
am	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
they,	1
even	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
are	1
my	1
people,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
ye	1
my	1
flock,	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
my	1
pasture,	1
are	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
God,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
35:1	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
35:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
it,	1
35:3	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
it,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
O	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
most	1
desolate.	1
	1
35:4	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
thy	1
cities	1
waste,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
35:5	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
a	1
perpetual	1
hatred,	1
and	1
hast	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
calamity,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
iniquity	1
had	1
an	1
end:	1
35:6	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
thee	1
unto	1
blood,	1
and	1
blood	1
shall	1
pursue	1
thee:	1
sith	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
hated	1
blood,	1
even	1
blood	1
shall	1
pursue	1
thee.	1
	1
35:7	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
mount	1
Seir	1
most	1
desolate,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
it	1
him	1
that	1
passeth	1
out	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
returneth.	1
	1
35:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
his	1
mountains	1
with	1
his	1
slain	1
men:	1
in	1
thy	1
hills,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
valleys,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
rivers,	1
shall	1
they	1
fall	1
that	1
are	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
35:9	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
perpetual	1
desolations,	1
and	1
thy	1
cities	1
shall	1
not	1
return:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
35:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
These	1
two	1
nations	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
countries	1
shall	1
be	1
mine,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
possess	1
it;	1
whereas	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
there:	1
35:11	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
anger,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
envy	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
used	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
hatred	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
myself	1
known	1
among	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
judged	1
thee.	1
	1
35:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
thy	1
blasphemies	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
They	1
are	1
laid	1
desolate,	1
they	1
are	1
given	1
us	1
to	1
consume.	1
	1
35:13	1
Thus	1
with	1
your	1
mouth	1
ye	1
have	1
boasted	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
multiplied	1
your	1
words	1
against	1
me:	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
35:14	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
When	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
rejoiceth,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
desolate.	1
	1
35:15	1
As	1
thou	1
didst	1
rejoice	1
at	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
desolate,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
desolate,	1
O	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
and	1
all	1
Idumea,	1
even	1
all	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
36:1	1
Also,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say,	1
Ye	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
36:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
the	1
enemy	1
hath	1
said	1
against	1
you,	1
Aha,	1
even	1
the	1
ancient	1
high	1
places	1
are	1
ours	1
in	1
possession:	1
36:3	1
Therefore	1
prophesy	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
desolate,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
you	1
up	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
possession	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
taken	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
talkers,	1
and	1
are	1
an	1
infamy	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
36:4	1
Therefore,	1
ye	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
to	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
valleys,	1
to	1
the	1
desolate	1
wastes,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
are	1
forsaken,	1
which	1
became	1
a	1
prey	1
and	1
derision	1
to	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about;	1
36:5	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Surely	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
jealousy	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
Idumea,	1
which	1
have	1
appointed	1
my	1
land	1
into	1
their	1
possession	1
with	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
heart,	1
with	1
despiteful	1
minds,	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
prey.	1
	1
36:6	1
Prophesy	1
therefore	1
concerning	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
to	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
valleys,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
my	1
jealousy	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
fury,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
the	1
heathen:	1
36:7	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand,	1
Surely	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
you,	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
shame.	1
	1
36:8	1
But	1
ye,	1
O	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
ye	1
shall	1
shoot	1
forth	1
your	1
branches,	1
and	1
yield	1
your	1
fruit	1
to	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
36:9	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
tilled	1
and	1
sown:	1
36:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
men	1
upon	1
you,	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
all	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited,	1
and	1
the	1
wastes	1
shall	1
be	1
builded:	1
36:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
upon	1
you	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
increase	1
and	1
bring	1
fruit:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
settle	1
you	1
after	1
your	1
old	1
estates,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
better	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
at	1
your	1
beginnings:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
36:12	1
Yea,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
men	1
to	1
walk	1
upon	1
you,	1
even	1
my	1
people	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
henceforth	1
bereave	1
them	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
36:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Because	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Thou	1
land	1
devourest	1
up	1
men,	1
and	1
hast	1
bereaved	1
thy	1
nations:	1
36:14	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
devour	1
men	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
bereave	1
thy	1
nations	1
any	1
more,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
36:15	1
Neither	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
men	1
to	1
hear	1
in	1
thee	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
any	1
more,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
any	1
more,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
cause	1
thy	1
nations	1
to	1
fall	1
any	1
more,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
36:16	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
36:17	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
when	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
land,	1
they	1
defiled	1
it	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
doings:	1
their	1
way	1
was	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
a	1
removed	1
woman.	1
	1
36:18	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
poured	1
my	1
fury	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
shed	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
idols	1
wherewith	1
they	1
had	1
polluted	1
it:	1
36:19	1
And	1
I	1
scattered	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
dispersed	1
through	1
the	1
countries:	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
way	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
doings	1
I	1
judged	1
them.	1
	1
36:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whither	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
profaned	1
my	1
holy	1
name,	1
when	1
they	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
36:21	1
But	1
I	1
had	1
pity	1
for	1
mine	1
holy	1
name,	1
which	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
profaned	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whither	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
36:22	1
Therefore	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
but	1
for	1
mine	1
holy	1
name's	1
sake,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
profaned	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whither	1
ye	1
went.	1
	1
36:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sanctify	1
my	1
great	1
name,	1
which	1
was	1
profaned	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
profaned	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
you	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
36:24	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
gather	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
countries,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
your	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
36:25	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
sprinkle	1
clean	1
water	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
filthiness,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
idols,	1
will	1
I	1
cleanse	1
you.	1
	1
36:26	1
A	1
new	1
heart	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
you,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
spirit	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
within	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
stony	1
heart	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
heart	1
of	1
flesh.	1
	1
36:27	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
within	1
you,	1
and	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
36:28	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
your	1
fathers;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
36:29	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
save	1
you	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
uncleannesses:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
will	1
increase	1
it,	1
and	1
lay	1
no	1
famine	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
36:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
no	1
more	1
reproach	1
of	1
famine	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
36:31	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
remember	1
your	1
own	1
evil	1
ways,	1
and	1
your	1
doings	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
good,	1
and	1
shall	1
lothe	1
yourselves	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
sight	1
for	1
your	1
iniquities	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
abominations.	1
	1
36:32	1
Not	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
do	1
I	1
this,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you:	1
be	1
ashamed	1
and	1
confounded	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
ways,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
36:33	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
cleansed	1
you	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
iniquities	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
the	1
wastes	1
shall	1
be	1
builded.	1
	1
36:34	1
And	1
the	1
desolate	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
tilled,	1
whereas	1
it	1
lay	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
36:35	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
This	1
land	1
that	1
was	1
desolate	1
is	1
become	1
like	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden;	1
and	1
the	1
waste	1
and	1
desolate	1
and	1
ruined	1
cities	1
are	1
become	1
fenced,	1
and	1
are	1
inhabited.	1
	1
36:36	1
Then	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
round	1
about	1
you	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
build	1
the	1
ruined	1
places,	1
and	1
plant	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
desolate:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
36:37	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
I	1
will	1
yet	1
for	1
this	1
be	1
enquired	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
increase	1
them	1
with	1
men	1
like	1
a	1
flock.	1
	1
36:38	1
As	1
the	1
holy	1
flock,	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
her	1
solemn	1
feasts;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
waste	1
cities	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
flocks	1
of	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:1	1
The	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
carried	1
me	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
valley	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
bones,	1
37:2	1
And	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
round	1
about:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
valley;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
dry.	1
	1
37:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
can	1
these	1
bones	1
live?	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
	1
37:4	1
Again	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Prophesy	1
upon	1
these	1
bones,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
ye	1
dry	1
bones,	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
unto	1
these	1
bones;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
breath	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live:	1
37:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
sinews	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
flesh	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
cover	1
you	1
with	1
skin,	1
and	1
put	1
breath	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:7	1
So	1
I	1
prophesied	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
commanded:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
prophesied,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
noise,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
shaking,	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
came	1
together,	1
bone	1
to	1
his	1
bone.	1
	1
37:8	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
beheld,	1
lo,	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
came	1
up	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
covered	1
them	1
above:	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
breath	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
37:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Prophesy	1
unto	1
the	1
wind,	1
prophesy,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Come	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
O	1
breath,	1
and	1
breathe	1
upon	1
these	1
slain,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
live.	1
	1
37:10	1
So	1
I	1
prophesied	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
came	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
lived,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
upon	1
their	1
feet,	1
an	1
exceeding	1
great	1
army.	1
	1
37:11	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
these	1
bones	1
are	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
behold,	1
they	1
say,	1
Our	1
bones	1
are	1
dried,	1
and	1
our	1
hope	1
is	1
lost:	1
we	1
are	1
cut	1
off	1
for	1
our	1
parts.	1
	1
37:12	1
Therefore	1
prophesy	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
your	1
graves,	1
and	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
graves,	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
37:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
your	1
graves,	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
graves,	1
37:14	1
And	1
shall	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
place	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
land:	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
and	1
performed	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
37:15	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
37:16	1
Moreover,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
take	1
thee	1
one	1
stick,	1
and	1
write	1
upon	1
it,	1
For	1
Judah,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
his	1
companions:	1
then	1
take	1
another	1
stick,	1
and	1
write	1
upon	1
it,	1
For	1
Joseph,	1
the	1
stick	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
his	1
companions:	1
37:17	1
And	1
join	1
them	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
into	1
one	1
stick;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
one	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
37:18	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
shew	1
us	1
what	1
thou	1
meanest	1
by	1
these?	1
	1
37:19	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
stick	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
his	1
fellows,	1
and	1
will	1
put	1
them	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
stick	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
one	1
stick,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
37:20	1
And	1
the	1
sticks	1
whereon	1
thou	1
writest	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thine	1
hand	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
37:21	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whither	1
they	1
be	1
gone,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
land:	1
37:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
one	1
king	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
to	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
two	1
nations,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
kingdoms	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
37:23	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
defile	1
themselves	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
their	1
idols,	1
nor	1
with	1
their	1
detestable	1
things,	1
nor	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
dwellingplaces,	1
wherein	1
they	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
will	1
cleanse	1
them:	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
37:24	1
And	1
David	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
shepherd:	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
observe	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
37:25	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
my	1
servant,	1
wherein	1
your	1
fathers	1
have	1
dwelt;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
even	1
they,	1
and	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
children's	1
children	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
David	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
prince	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
37:26	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
them;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
them,	1
and	1
multiply	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
37:27	1
My	1
tabernacle	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
them:	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
37:28	1
And	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
Israel,	1
when	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
38:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
38:2	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
set	1
thy	1
face	1
against	1
Gog,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Magog,	1
the	1
chief	1
prince	1
of	1
Meshech	1
and	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
against	1
him,	1
38:3	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
Gog,	1
the	1
chief	1
prince	1
of	1
Meshech	1
and	1
Tubal:	1
38:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
thee	1
back,	1
and	1
put	1
hooks	1
into	1
thy	1
jaws,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
forth,	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
army,	1
horses	1
and	1
horsemen,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
clothed	1
with	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
armour,	1
even	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
with	1
bucklers	1
and	1
shields,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
handling	1
swords:	1
38:5	1
Persia,	1
Ethiopia,	1
and	1
Libya	1
with	1
them;	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
shield	1
and	1
helmet:	1
38:6	1
Gomer,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bands;	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Togarmah	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
quarters,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bands:	1
and	1
many	1
people	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
38:7	1
Be	1
thou	1
prepared,	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
thyself,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
that	1
are	1
assembled	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
a	1
guard	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
38:8	1
After	1
many	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
visited:	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
is	1
gathered	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
people,	1
against	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
waste:	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
safely	1
all	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
38:9	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
ascend	1
and	1
come	1
like	1
a	1
storm,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
land,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
bands,	1
and	1
many	1
people	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
38:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
It	1
shall	1
also	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
shall	1
things	1
come	1
into	1
thy	1
mind,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
think	1
an	1
evil	1
thought:	1
38:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
unwalled	1
villages;	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
rest,	1
that	1
dwell	1
safely,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
dwelling	1
without	1
walls,	1
and	1
having	1
neither	1
bars	1
nor	1
gates,	1
38:12	1
To	1
take	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
prey;	1
to	1
turn	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
desolate	1
places	1
that	1
are	1
now	1
inhabited,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
gathered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
which	1
have	1
gotten	1
cattle	1
and	1
goods,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
38:13	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Dedan,	1
and	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
Tarshish,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
lions	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
spoil?	1
hast	1
thou	1
gathered	1
thy	1
company	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
prey?	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
cattle	1
and	1
goods,	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
great	1
spoil?	1
38:14	1
Therefore,	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
Gog,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
dwelleth	1
safely,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
know	1
it?	1
	1
38:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
from	1
thy	1
place	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
parts,	1
thou,	1
and	1
many	1
people	1
with	1
thee,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
riding	1
upon	1
horses,	1
a	1
great	1
company,	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
army:	1
38:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
a	1
cloud	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
land;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
against	1
my	1
land,	1
that	1
the	1
heathen	1
may	1
know	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
thee,	1
O	1
Gog,	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
38:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
by	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
prophesied	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
many	1
years	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
bring	1
thee	1
against	1
them?	1
	1
38:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
when	1
Gog	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
my	1
fury	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
38:19	1
For	1
in	1
my	1
jealousy	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
wrath	1
have	1
I	1
spoken,	1
Surely	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
shaking	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
38:20	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
all	1
creeping	1
things	1
that	1
creep	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
shall	1
shake	1
at	1
my	1
presence,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
steep	1
places	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
every	1
wall	1
shall	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
38:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
a	1
sword	1
against	1
him	1
throughout	1
all	1
my	1
mountains,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
every	1
man's	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
38:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
plead	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
pestilence	1
and	1
with	1
blood;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rain	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
bands,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
many	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
an	1
overflowing	1
rain,	1
and	1
great	1
hailstones,	1
fire,	1
and	1
brimstone.	1
	1
38:23	1
Thus	1
will	1
I	1
magnify	1
myself,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
many	1
nations,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:1	1
Therefore,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
prophesy	1
against	1
Gog,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
O	1
Gog,	1
the	1
chief	1
prince	1
of	1
Meshech	1
and	1
Tubal:	1
39:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
thee	1
back,	1
and	1
leave	1
but	1
the	1
sixth	1
part	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
thee	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
parts,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel:	1
39:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thy	1
bow	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
thine	1
arrows	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
39:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
bands,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
ravenous	1
birds	1
of	1
every	1
sort,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
be	1
devoured.	1
	1
39:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
field:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
39:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
Magog,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
carelessly	1
in	1
the	1
isles:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:7	1
So	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
pollute	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
any	1
more:	1
and	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
39:8	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
done,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
whereof	1
I	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
39:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
burn	1
the	1
weapons,	1
both	1
the	1
shields	1
and	1
the	1
bucklers,	1
the	1
bows	1
and	1
the	1
arrows,	1
and	1
the	1
handstaves,	1
and	1
the	1
spears,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
with	1
fire	1
seven	1
years:	1
39:10	1
So	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
wood	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
neither	1
cut	1
down	1
any	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
forests;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
the	1
weapons	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
spoil	1
those	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them,	1
and	1
rob	1
those	1
that	1
robbed	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
39:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
Gog	1
a	1
place	1
there	1
of	1
graves	1
in	1
Israel,	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
passengers	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
stop	1
the	1
noses	1
of	1
the	1
passengers:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
bury	1
Gog	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
it	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
Hamongog.	1
	1
39:12	1
And	1
seven	1
months	1
shall	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
burying	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
cleanse	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
39:13	1
Yea,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
bury	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
renown	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glorified,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
39:14	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
sever	1
out	1
men	1
of	1
continual	1
employment,	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
bury	1
with	1
the	1
passengers	1
those	1
that	1
remain	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
it:	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
seven	1
months	1
shall	1
they	1
search.	1
	1
39:15	1
And	1
the	1
passengers	1
that	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
land,	1
when	1
any	1
seeth	1
a	1
man's	1
bone,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
sign	1
by	1
it,	1
till	1
the	1
buriers	1
have	1
buried	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Hamongog.	1
	1
39:16	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
Hamonah.	1
Thus	1
shall	1
they	1
cleanse	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
39:17	1
And,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Speak	1
unto	1
every	1
feathered	1
fowl,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come;	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
to	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
you,	1
even	1
a	1
great	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drink	1
blood.	1
	1
39:18	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
of	1
rams,	1
of	1
lambs,	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
of	1
bullocks,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
fatlings	1
of	1
Bashan.	1
	1
39:19	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
fat	1
till	1
ye	1
be	1
full,	1
and	1
drink	1
blood	1
till	1
ye	1
be	1
drunken,	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
39:20	1
Thus	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
with	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots,	1
with	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
39:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
glory	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
judgment	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
executed,	1
and	1
my	1
hand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
39:22	1
So	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
forward.	1
	1
39:23	1
And	1
the	1
heathen	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
into	1
captivity	1
for	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
because	1
they	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me,	1
therefore	1
hid	1
I	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies:	1
so	1
fell	1
they	1
all	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
39:24	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
transgressions	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
hid	1
my	1
face	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
39:25	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
jealous	1
for	1
my	1
holy	1
name;	1
39:26	1
After	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
borne	1
their	1
shame,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
trespasses	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me,	1
when	1
they	1
dwelt	1
safely	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
none	1
made	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
39:27	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
gathered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
enemies'	1
lands,	1
and	1
am	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
many	1
nations;	1
39:28	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
which	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
captivity	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
them	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
land,	1
and	1
have	1
left	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
any	1
more	1
there.	1
	1
39:29	1
Neither	1
will	1
I	1
hide	1
my	1
face	1
any	1
more	1
from	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
40:1	1
In	1
the	1
five	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
our	1
captivity,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
smitten,	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
thither.	1
	1
40:2	1
In	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
God	1
brought	1
he	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
mountain,	1
by	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
thither,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
whose	1
appearance	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
brass,	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
flax	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
measuring	1
reed;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
behold	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
thine	1
ears,	1
and	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee;	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
them	1
unto	1
thee	1
art	1
thou	1
brought	1
hither:	1
declare	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
seest	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
40:5	1
And	1
behold	1
a	1
wall	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
man's	1
hand	1
a	1
measuring	1
reed	1
of	1
six	1
cubits	1
long	1
by	1
the	1
cubit	1
and	1
an	1
hand	1
breadth:	1
so	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
one	1
reed;	1
and	1
the	1
height,	1
one	1
reed.	1
	1
40:6	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
which	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
thereof,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
reed	1
broad;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
reed	1
broad.	1
	1
40:7	1
And	1
every	1
little	1
chamber	1
was	1
one	1
reed	1
long,	1
and	1
one	1
reed	1
broad;	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
little	1
chambers	1
were	1
five	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
by	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
within	1
was	1
one	1
reed.	1
	1
40:8	1
He	1
measured	1
also	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
within,	1
one	1
reed.	1
	1
40:9	1
Then	1
measured	1
he	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
eight	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
posts	1
thereof,	1
two	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
was	1
inward.	1
	1
40:10	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
chambers	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
eastward	1
were	1
three	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
three	1
on	1
that	1
side;	1
they	1
three	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
measure:	1
and	1
the	1
posts	1
had	1
one	1
measure	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
40:11	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
ten	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
thirteen	1
cubits.	1
	1
40:12	1
The	1
space	1
also	1
before	1
the	1
little	1
chambers	1
was	1
one	1
cubit	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
space	1
was	1
one	1
cubit	1
on	1
that	1
side:	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
chambers	1
were	1
six	1
cubits	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
six	1
cubits	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
40:13	1
He	1
measured	1
then	1
the	1
gate	1
from	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
one	1
little	1
chamber	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
another:	1
the	1
breadth	1
was	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
door	1
against	1
door.	1
	1
40:14	1
He	1
made	1
also	1
posts	1
of	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
40:15	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
entrance	1
unto	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
gate	1
were	1
fifty	1
cubits.	1
	1
40:16	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
narrow	1
windows	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
chambers,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
posts	1
within	1
the	1
gate	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
likewise	1
to	1
the	1
arches:	1
and	1
windows	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
inward:	1
and	1
upon	1
each	1
post	1
were	1
palm	1
trees.	1
	1
40:17	1
Then	1
brought	1
he	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
outward	1
court,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
were	1
chambers,	1
and	1
a	1
pavement	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about:	1
thirty	1
chambers	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
40:18	1
And	1
the	1
pavement	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
was	1
the	1
lower	1
pavement.	1
	1
40:19	1
Then	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
breadth	1
from	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
without,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
eastward	1
and	1
northward.	1
	1
40:20	1
And	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
outward	1
court	1
that	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof.	1
	1
40:21	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
chambers	1
thereof	1
were	1
three	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
three	1
on	1
that	1
side;	1
and	1
the	1
posts	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
arches	1
thereof	1
were	1
after	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
gate:	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
fifty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
cubits.	1
	1
40:22	1
And	1
their	1
windows,	1
and	1
their	1
arches,	1
and	1
their	1
palm	1
trees,	1
were	1
after	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
that	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
east;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
it	1
by	1
seven	1
steps;	1
and	1
the	1
arches	1
thereof	1
were	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
40:23	1
And	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
was	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
gate	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
east;	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
from	1
gate	1
to	1
gate	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits.	1
	1
40:24	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
gate	1
toward	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
posts	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
arches	1
thereof	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
measures.	1
	1
40:25	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
windows	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
arches	1
thereof	1
round	1
about,	1

and	1
the	1

	1
40:26	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1

it,	1
and	1
the	1

	1
40:27	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1

	1
40:28	1
And	1

	1
40:45	1
And	1

This	1

is	1

	1
40:46	1
And	1
the	1
chamber	1
whose	1
prospect	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zadok	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
which	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
40:47	1
So	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
court,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
long,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
broad,	1
foursquare;	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
40:48	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
measured	1
each	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
porch,	1
five	1
cubits	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
on	1
that	1
side:	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
was	1
three	1
cubits	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
three	1
cubits	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
40:49	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
was	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
eleven	1
cubits,	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
steps	1
whereby	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
it:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
pillars	1
by	1
the	1
posts,	1
one	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
another	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
41:1	1
Afterward	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
posts,	1
six	1
cubits	1
broad	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
six	1
cubits	1
broad	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
41:2	1
And	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
ten	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
were	1
five	1
cubits	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
forty	1
cubits:	1
and	1
the	1
breadth,	1
twenty	1
cubits.	1
	1
41:3	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
inward,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
two	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
door,	1
six	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
seven	1
cubits.	1
	1
41:4	1
So	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
twenty	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
breadth,	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
before	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
41:5	1
After	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
six	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
every	1
side	1
chamber,	1
four	1
cubits,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
41:6	1
And	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
were	1
three,	1
one	1
over	1
another,	1
and	1
thirty	1
in	1
order;	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
wall	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
round	1
about,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
hold,	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
hold	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
41:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
enlarging,	1
and	1
a	1
winding	1
about	1
still	1
upward	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
chambers:	1
for	1
the	1
winding	1
about	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
went	1
still	1
upward	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
house:	1
therefore	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
still	1
upward,	1
and	1
so	1
increased	1
from	1
the	1
lowest	1
chamber	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
by	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
41:8	1
I	1
saw	1
also	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about:	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
were	1
a	1
full	1
reed	1
of	1
six	1
great	1
cubits.	1
	1
41:9	1
The	1
thickness	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
side	1
chamber	1
without,	1
was	1
five	1
cubits:	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
left	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
that	1
were	1
within.	1
	1
41:10	1
And	1
between	1
the	1
chambers	1
was	1
the	1
wideness	1
of	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
41:11	1
And	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
were	1
toward	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
left,	1
one	1
door	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
another	1
door	1
toward	1
the	1
south:	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
was	1
five	1
cubits	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
41:12	1
Now	1
the	1
building	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
separate	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
toward	1
the	1
west	1
was	1
seventy	1
cubits	1
broad;	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
was	1
five	1
cubits	1
thick	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
ninety	1
cubits.	1
	1
41:13	1
So	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
house,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
long;	1
and	1
the	1
separate	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
building,	1
with	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
long;	1
41:14	1
Also	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
separate	1
place	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits.	1
	1
41:15	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
separate	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
behind	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
galleries	1
thereof	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits,	1
with	1
the	1
inner	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
porches	1
of	1
the	1
court;	1
41:16	1
The	1
door	1
posts,	1
and	1
the	1
narrow	1
windows,	1
and	1
the	1
galleries	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
their	1
three	1
stories,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
door,	1
cieled	1
with	1
wood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
windows,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
covered;	1
41:17	1
To	1
that	1
above	1
the	1
door,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
inner	1
house,	1
and	1
without,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
wall	1
round	1
about	1
within	1
and	1
without,	1
by	1
measure.	1
	1
41:18	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
with	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees,	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
palm	1
tree	1
was	1
between	1
a	1
cherub	1
and	1
a	1
cherub;	1
and	1
every	1
cherub	1
had	1
two	1
faces;	1
41:19	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
toward	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
toward	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
41:20	1
From	1
the	1
ground	1
unto	1
above	1
the	1
door	1
were	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees	1
made,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
41:21	1
The	1
posts	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
were	1
squared,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary;	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
41:22	1
The	1
altar	1
of	1
wood	1
was	1
three	1
cubits	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
two	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof,	1
were	1
of	1
wood:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
table	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
41:23	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
had	1
two	1
doors.	1
	1
41:24	1
And	1
the	1
doors	1
had	1
two	1
leaves	1
apiece,	1
two	1
turning	1
leaves;	1
two	1
leaves	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
door,	1
and	1
two	1
leaves	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
	1
41:25	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
made	1
on	1
them,	1
on	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees,	1
like	1
as	1
were	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
walls;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
thick	1
planks	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
without.	1
	1
41:26	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
narrow	1
windows	1
and	1
palm	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
porch,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
side	1
chambers	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
thick	1
planks.	1
	1
42:1	1
Then	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
the	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
north:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
separate	1
place,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
building	1
toward	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
42:2	1
Before	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
north	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
was	1
fifty	1
cubits.	1
	1
42:3	1
Over	1
against	1
the	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
which	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
and	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
pavement	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
was	1
gallery	1
against	1
gallery	1
in	1
three	1
stories.	1
	1
42:4	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
chambers	1
was	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
ten	1
cubits	1
breadth	1
inward,	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
one	1
cubit;	1
and	1
their	1
doors	1
toward	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
42:5	1
Now	1
the	1
upper	1
chambers	1
were	1
shorter:	1
for	1
the	1
galleries	1
were	1
higher	1
than	1
these,	1
than	1
the	1
lower,	1
and	1
than	1
the	1
middlemost	1
of	1
the	1
building.	1
	1
42:6	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
three	1
stories,	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
pillars	1
as	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
the	1
courts:	1
therefore	1
the	1
building	1
was	1
straitened	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
lowest	1
and	1
the	1
middlemost	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
42:7	1
And	1
the	1
wall	1
that	1
was	1
without	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
chambers,	1
toward	1
the	1
utter	1
court	1
on	1
the	1
forepart	1
of	1
the	1
chambers,	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
fifty	1
cubits.	1
	1
42:8	1
For	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
chambers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
utter	1
court	1
was	1
fifty	1
cubits:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
before	1
the	1
temple	1
were	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits.	1
	1
42:9	1
And	1
from	1
under	1
these	1
chambers	1
was	1
the	1
entry	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side,	1
as	1
one	1
goeth	1
into	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
utter	1
court.	1
	1
42:10	1
The	1
chambers	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
thickness	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
separate	1
place,	1
and	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
building.	1
	1
42:11	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
them	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
chambers	1
which	1
were	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they,	1
and	1
as	1
broad	1
as	1
they:	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
goings	1
out	1
were	1
both	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
fashions,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
doors.	1
	1
42:12	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
chambers	1
that	1
were	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
was	1
a	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
even	1
the	1
way	1
directly	1
before	1
the	1
wall	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
as	1
one	1
entereth	1
into	1
them.	1
	1
42:13	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
north	1
chambers	1
and	1
the	1
south	1
chambers,	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
the	1
separate	1
place,	1
they	1
be	1
holy	1
chambers,	1
where	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
approach	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things:	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
lay	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering;	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
42:14	1
When	1
the	1
priests	1
enter	1
therein,	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
but	1
there	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
garments	1
wherein	1
they	1
minister;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
holy;	1
and	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
shall	1
approach	1
to	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
42:15	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
measuring	1
the	1
inner	1
house,	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
toward	1
the	1
gate	1
whose	1
prospect	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
measured	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
42:16	1
He	1
measured	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
measuring	1
reed,	1
five	1
hundred	1
reeds,	1
with	1
the	1
measuring	1
reed	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
42:17	1
He	1
measured	1
the	1
north	1
side,	1
five	1
hundred	1
reeds,	1
with	1
the	1
measuring	1
reed	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
42:18	1
He	1
measured	1
the	1
south	1
side,	1
five	1
hundred	1
reeds,	1
with	1
the	1
measuring	1
reed.	1
	1
42:19	1
He	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
side,	1
and	1
measured	1
five	1
hundred	1
reeds	1
with	1
the	1
measuring	1
reed.	1
	1
42:20	1
He	1
measured	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
four	1
sides:	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
wall	1
round	1
about,	1
five	1
hundred	1
reeds	1
long,	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
broad,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
separation	1
between	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
profane	1
place.	1
	1
43:1	1
Afterward	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
even	1
the	1
gate	1
that	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
east:	1
43:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
east:	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
many	1
waters:	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shined	1
with	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
43:3	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
vision	1
which	1
I	1
saw,	1
even	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
vision	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
vision	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Chebar;	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
43:4	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
whose	1
prospect	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
43:5	1
So	1
the	1
spirit	1
took	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
43:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
stood	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
43:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
my	1
feet,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
my	1
holy	1
name,	1
shall	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
no	1
more	1
defile,	1
neither	1
they,	1
nor	1
their	1
kings,	1
by	1
their	1
whoredom,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
their	1
kings	1
in	1
their	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
43:8	1
In	1
their	1
setting	1
of	1
their	1
threshold	1
by	1
my	1
thresholds,	1
and	1
their	1
post	1
by	1
my	1
posts,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
them,	1
they	1
have	1
even	1
defiled	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
by	1
their	1
abominations	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
committed:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them	1
in	1
mine	1
anger.	1
	1
43:9	1
Now	1
let	1
them	1
put	1
away	1
their	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
their	1
kings,	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
43:10	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
man,	1
shew	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
iniquities:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
measure	1
the	1
pattern.	1
	1
43:11	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done,	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
fashion	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
goings	1
out	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
comings	1
in	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
forms	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ordinances	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
forms	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
thereof:	1
and	1
write	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
sight,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
keep	1
the	1
whole	1
form	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
ordinances	1
thereof,	1
and	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
43:12	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
Upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
the	1
whole	1
limit	1
thereof	1
round	1
about	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
holy.	1
Behold,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
43:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
after	1
the	1
cubits:	1
The	1
cubit	1
is	1
a	1
cubit	1
and	1
an	1
hand	1
breadth;	1
even	1
the	1
bottom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
cubit,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
a	1
cubit,	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
thereof	1
by	1
the	1
edge	1
thereof	1
round	1
about	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
span:	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
higher	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
43:14	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
lower	1
settle	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
one	1
cubit;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
lesser	1
settle	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
settle	1
shall	1
be	1
four	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
one	1
cubit.	1
	1
43:15	1
So	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
four	1
cubits;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
upward	1
shall	1
be	1
four	1
horns.	1
	1
43:16	1
And	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
twelve	1
cubits	1
long,	1
twelve	1
broad,	1
square	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
squares	1
thereof.	1
	1
43:17	1
And	1
the	1
settle	1
shall	1
be	1
fourteen	1
cubits	1
long	1
and	1
fourteen	1
broad	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
squares	1
thereof;	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
about	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
half	1
a	1
cubit;	1
and	1
the	1
bottom	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
cubit	1
about;	1
and	1
his	1
stairs	1
shall	1
look	1
toward	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
43:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
it,	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
thereon,	1
and	1
to	1
sprinkle	1
blood	1
thereon.	1
	1
43:19	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Zadok,	1
which	1
approach	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
43:20	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
horns	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
settle,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
border	1
round	1
about:	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
cleanse	1
and	1
purge	1
it.	1
	1
43:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
bullock	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
appointed	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
without	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
43:22	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
a	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
without	1
blemish	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
cleanse	1
the	1
altar,	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
cleanse	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
bullock.	1
	1
43:23	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
cleansing	1
it,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
without	1
blemish,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
43:24	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
cast	1
salt	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
them	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
43:25	1
Seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
prepare	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
goat	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering:	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
prepare	1
a	1
young	1
bullock,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
43:26	1
Seven	1
days	1
shall	1
they	1
purge	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
purify	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
themselves.	1
	1
43:27	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
days	1
are	1
expired,	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
and	1
so	1
forward,	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
make	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
your	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
44:1	1
Then	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
back	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
outward	1
sanctuary	1
which	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
east;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
shut.	1
	1
44:2	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me;	1
This	1
gate	1
shall	1
be	1
shut,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
enter	1
in	1
by	1
it;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hath	1
entered	1
in	1
by	1
it,	1
therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
shut.	1
	1
44:3	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
prince;	1
the	1
prince,	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
he	1
shall	1
enter	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
that	1
gate,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
44:4	1
Then	1
brought	1
he	1
me	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
gate	1
before	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
44:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
mark	1
well,	1
and	1
behold	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
thine	1
ears	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
thereof;	1
and	1
mark	1
well	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
every	1
going	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
44:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
rebellious,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
it	1
suffice	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
abominations,	1
44:7	1
In	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
into	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
strangers,	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart,	1
and	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
flesh,	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
to	1
pollute	1
it,	1
even	1
my	1
house,	1
when	1
ye	1
offer	1
my	1
bread,	1
the	1
fat	1
and	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
broken	1
my	1
covenant	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
abominations.	1
	1
44:8	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
mine	1
holy	1
things:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
set	1
keepers	1
of	1
my	1
charge	1
in	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
44:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
No	1
stranger,	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart,	1
nor	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
flesh,	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
of	1
any	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
44:10	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
when	1
Israel	1
went	1
astray,	1
which	1
went	1
astray	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
after	1
their	1
idols;	1
they	1
shall	1
even	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
44:11	1
Yet	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ministers	1
in	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
having	1
charge	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
house:	1
they	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
them	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
44:12	1
Because	1
they	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them	1
before	1
their	1
idols,	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
iniquity;	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
44:13	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
priest	1
unto	1
me,	1
nor	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
holy	1
things,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
shame,	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
44:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
thereof,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
therein.	1
	1
44:15	1
But	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zadok,	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
my	1
sanctuary	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
astray	1
from	1
me,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
offer	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
fat	1
and	1
the	1
blood,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
44:16	1
They	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
my	1
table,	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
charge.	1
	1
44:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
linen	1
garments;	1
and	1
no	1
wool	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
them,	1
whiles	1
they	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
and	1
within.	1
	1
44:18	1
They	1
shall	1
have	1
linen	1
bonnets	1
upon	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
linen	1
breeches	1
upon	1
their	1
loins;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
gird	1
themselves	1
with	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
causeth	1
sweat.	1
	1
44:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
off	1
their	1
garments	1
wherein	1
they	1
ministered,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
chambers,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
garments;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
their	1
garments.	1
	1
44:20	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
shave	1
their	1
heads,	1
nor	1
suffer	1
their	1
locks	1
to	1
grow	1
long;	1
they	1
shall	1
only	1
poll	1
their	1
heads.	1
	1
44:21	1
Neither	1
shall	1
any	1
priest	1
drink	1
wine,	1
when	1
they	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court.	1
	1
44:22	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
for	1
their	1
wives	1
a	1
widow,	1
nor	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
put	1
away:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
maidens	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
a	1
widow	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
priest	1
before.	1
	1
44:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
teach	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
holy	1
and	1
profane,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
discern	1
between	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean.	1
	1
44:24	1
And	1
in	1
controversy	1
they	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
judgment;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
judge	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
judgments:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
laws	1
and	1
my	1
statutes	1
in	1
all	1
mine	1
assemblies;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hallow	1
my	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
44:25	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
at	1
no	1
dead	1
person	1
to	1
defile	1
themselves:	1
but	1
for	1
father,	1
or	1
for	1
mother,	1
or	1
for	1
son,	1
or	1
for	1
daughter,	1
for	1
brother,	1
or	1
for	1
sister	1
that	1
hath	1
had	1
no	1
husband,	1
they	1
may	1
defile	1
themselves.	1
	1
44:26	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
is	1
cleansed,	1
they	1
shall	1
reckon	1
unto	1
him	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
44:27	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
unto	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
his	1
sin	1
offering,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
44:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance:	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
inheritance:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
them	1
no	1
possession	1
in	1
Israel:	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
possession.	1
	1
44:29	1
They	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
and	1
every	1
dedicated	1
thing	1
in	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
theirs.	1
	1
44:30	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
every	1
oblation	1
of	1
all,	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
your	1
oblations,	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's:	1
ye	1
shall	1
also	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
your	1
dough,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
cause	1
the	1
blessing	1
to	1
rest	1
in	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
44:31	1
The	1
priests	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
dead	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
torn,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
fowl	1
or	1
beast.	1
	1
45:1	1
Moreover,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
divide	1
by	1
lot	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
inheritance,	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
oblation	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
an	1
holy	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1

This	1

	1
45:2	1
Of	1

	1
45:3	1
And	1
of	1

	1
45:4	1
The	1

	1
45:6	1
And	1

	1
45:7	1
And	1

	1
45:8	1
In	1

	1
45:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
Let	1

you,	1
O	1

	1
45:10	1
Ye	1

This	1

	1
45:16	1
All	1
the	1

	1
45:17	1
And	1

	1
45:18	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
In	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
young	1

without	1

and	1
cleanse	1
the	1

45:19	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1

and	1
put	1

	1
45:20	1
And	1
so	1
thou	1

of	1
the	1

for	1
every	1

and	1
for	1
him	1
that	1

so	1
shall	1
ye	1

	1
45:21	1
In	1
the	1

in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1

	1
45:23	1
And	1
seven	1

In	1

The	1

opened,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
46:2	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
enter	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
that	1
gate	1
without,	1
and	1
shall	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
prepare	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth;	1
but	1
the	1
gate	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
until	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
46:3	1
Likewise	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
this	1
gate	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
sabbaths	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
moons.	1
	1
46:4	1
And	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
six	1
lambs	1
without	1
blemish,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
46:5	1
And	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
ephah	1
for	1
a	1
ram,	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
lambs	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give,	1
and	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil	1
to	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
46:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
without	1
blemish,	1
and	1
six	1
lambs,	1
and	1
a	1
ram:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
46:7	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
a	1
meat	1
offering,	1
an	1
ephah	1
for	1
a	1
bullock,	1
and	1
an	1
ephah	1
for	1
a	1
ram,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
lambs	1
according	1
as	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
attain	1
unto,	1
and	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil	1
to	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
46:8	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
enter,	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
that	1
gate,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
thereof.	1
	1
46:9	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
gate	1
to	1
worship	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
gate;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
gate	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
gate:	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
whereby	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
but	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
over	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
46:10	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
go	1
in,	1
shall	1
go	1
in;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
go	1
forth,	1
shall	1
go	1
forth.	1
	1
46:11	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
feasts	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
solemnities	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
ephah	1
to	1
a	1
bullock,	1
and	1
an	1
ephah	1
to	1
a	1
ram,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
lambs	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
give,	1
and	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil	1
to	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
46:12	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
prepare	1
a	1
voluntary	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
peace	1
offerings	1
voluntarily	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
one	1
shall	1
then	1
open	1
him	1
the	1
gate	1
that	1
looketh	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth;	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
going	1
forth	1
one	1
shall	1
shut	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
46:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
daily	1
prepare	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
without	1
blemish:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
it	1
every	1
morning.	1
	1
46:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
for	1
it	1
every	1
morning,	1
the	1
sixth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil,	1
to	1
temper	1
with	1
the	1
fine	1
flour;	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
continually	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
ordinance	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
46:15	1
Thus	1
shall	1
they	1
prepare	1
the	1
lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
oil,	1
every	1
morning	1
for	1
a	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
46:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
If	1
the	1
prince	1
give	1
a	1
gift	1
unto	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
the	1
inheritance	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
sons';	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
possession	1
by	1
inheritance.	1
	1
46:17	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
give	1
a	1
gift	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
to	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
liberty;	1
after	1
it	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
prince:	1
but	1
his	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
sons'	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
46:18	1
Moreover	1
the	1
prince	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
inheritance	1
by	1
oppression,	1
to	1
thrust	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
possession;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
sons	1
inheritance	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
possession:	1
that	1
my	1
people	1
be	1
not	1
scattered	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
46:19	1
After	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
entry,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
chambers	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
north:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
westward.	1
	1
46:20	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
boil	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
where	1
they	1
shall	1
bake	1
the	1
meat	1
offering;	1
that	1
they	1
bear	1
them	1
not	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
46:21	1
Then	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
utter	1
court,	1
and	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
court;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
in	1
every	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
court.	1
	1
46:22	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
there	1
were	1
courts	1
joined	1
of	1
forty	1
cubits	1
long	1
and	1
thirty	1
broad:	1
these	1
four	1
corners	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
measure.	1
	1
46:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
building	1
round	1
about	1
in	1
them,	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
four,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
with	1
boiling	1
places	1
under	1
the	1
rows	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
46:24	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
boil,	1
where	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
shall	1
boil	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
47:1	1
Afterward	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
waters	1
issued	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
eastward:	1
for	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
stood	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
under	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
at	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
47:2	1
Then	1
brought	1
he	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
northward,	1
and	1
led	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
way	1
without	1
unto	1
the	1
utter	1
gate	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
looketh	1
eastward;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
ran	1
out	1
waters	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side.	1
	1
47:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
went	1
forth	1
eastward,	1
he	1
measured	1
a	1
thousand	1
cubits,	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
waters;	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
ankles.	1
	1
47:4	1
Again	1
he	1
measured	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
waters;	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
knees.	1
Again	1
he	1
measured	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
brought	1
me	1
through;	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
loins.	1
	1
47:5	1
Afterward	1
he	1
measured	1
a	1
thousand;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
river	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
pass	1
over:	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
risen,	1
waters	1
to	1
swim	1
in,	1
a	1
river	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
passed	1
over.	1
	1
47:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
this?	1
Then	1
he	1
brought	1
me,	1
and	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
47:7	1
Now	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
returned,	1
behold,	1
at	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
were	1
very	1
many	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
47:8	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
waters	1
issue	1
out	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
country,	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
which	1
being	1
brought	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
47:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
liveth,	1
which	1
moveth,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
rivers	1
shall	1
come,	1
shall	1
live:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
fish,	1
because	1
these	1
waters	1
shall	1
come	1
thither:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
healed;	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
shall	1
live	1
whither	1
the	1
river	1
cometh.	1
	1
47:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
fishers	1
shall	1
stand	1
upon	1
it	1
from	1
Engedi	1
even	1
unto	1
Eneglaim;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
spread	1
forth	1
nets;	1
their	1
fish	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
kinds,	1
as	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
sea,	1
exceeding	1
many.	1
	1
47:11	1
But	1
the	1
miry	1
places	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
marishes	1
thereof	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
healed;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
salt.	1
	1
47:12	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
thereof,	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
side,	1
shall	1
grow	1
all	1
trees	1
for	1
meat,	1
whose	1
leaf	1
shall	1
not	1
fade,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
be	1
consumed:	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
new	1
fruit	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
months,	1
because	1
their	1
waters	1
they	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
leaf	1
thereof	1
for	1
medicine.	1
	1
47:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
border,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel:	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
have	1
two	1
portions.	1
	1
47:14	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it,	1
one	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
another:	1
concerning	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
your	1
fathers:	1
and	1
this	1
land	1
shall	1
fall	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
inheritance.	1
	1
47:15	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
side,	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
sea,	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Hethlon,	1
as	1
men	1
go	1
to	1
Zedad;	1
47:16	1
Hamath,	1
Berothah,	1
Sibraim,	1
which	1
is	1
between	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Damascus	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Hamath;	1
Hazarhatticon,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Hauran.	1
	1
47:17	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
shall	1
be	1
Hazarenan,	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
the	1
north	1
northward,	1
and	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Hamath.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
north	1
side.	1
	1
47:18	1
And	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
ye	1
shall	1
measure	1
from	1
Hauran,	1
and	1
from	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
from	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1

	1
47:20	1
The	1

So	1

unto	1
you,	1

that	1

you,	1
which	1

beget	1
children	1
among	1
you:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1

among	1
the	1

Israel.	1
	1
47:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1

that	1
in	1
what	1

the	1

sojourneth,	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
give	1
him	1
his	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Daniel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
with	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
into	1
the	1
treasure	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ashpenaz	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
eunuchs,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
seed,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princes;	1
1:4	1
Children	1
in	1
whom	1
was	1
no	1
blemish,	1
but	1
well	1
favoured,	1
and	1
skilful	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
cunning	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding	1
science,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
ability	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
palace,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
might	1
teach	1
the	1
learning	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
appointed	1
them	1
a	1
daily	1
provision	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
so	1
nourishing	1
them	1
three	1
years,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
they	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:6	1
Now	1
among	1
these	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
1:7	1
Unto	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
gave	1
names:	1
for	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
of	1
Shadrach;	1

Meshach;	1
and	1
to	1
Azariah,	1
of	1
Abednego.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
Daniel	1
purposed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
defile	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
therefore	1
he	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
defile	1
himself.	1
	1
1:9	1
Now	1
God	1
had	1
brought	1
Daniel	1
into	1
favour	1
and	1
tender	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
your	1
meat	1
and	1
your	1
drink:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
see	1
your	1
faces	1
worse	1
liking	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
sort?	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
me	1
endanger	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
to	1
Melzar,	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
1:12	1
Prove	1
thy	1
servants,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
ten	1
days;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
us	1
pulse	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
water	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
let	1
our	1
countenances	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat:	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
seest,	1
deal	1
with	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
and	1
proved	1
them	1
ten	1
days.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
ten	1
days	1
their	1
countenances	1
appeared	1
fairer	1
and	1
fatter	1
in	1
flesh	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat.	1
	1
1:16	1
Thus	1
Melzar	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
drink;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
pulse.	1
	1
1:17	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
four	1
children,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
knowledge	1
and	1
skill	1
in	1
all	1
learning	1
and	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
Daniel	1
had	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
visions	1
and	1
dreams.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
in,	1
then	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
brought	1
them	1
in	1
before	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
communed	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
all	1
was	1
found	1
none	1
like	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
therefore	1
stood	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
enquired	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
ten	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
and	1
astrologers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
realm.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
Daniel	1
continued	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Cyrus.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
dreamed	1
dreams,	1
wherewith	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
brake	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
magicians,	1
and	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
and	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
dreams.	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
Syriack,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
tell	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me:	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
with	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
your	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shew	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
me	1
gifts	1
and	1
rewards	1
and	1
great	1
honour:	1
therefore	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
answered	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
king	1
tell	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
certainty	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
gain	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
decree	1
for	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
prepared	1
lying	1
and	1
corrupt	1
words	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
me,	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
be	1
changed:	1
therefore	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
Chaldeans	1
answered	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
the	1
king's	1
matter:	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
king,	1
lord,	1
nor	1
ruler,	1
that	1
asked	1
such	1
things	1
at	1
any	1
magician,	1
or	1
astrologer,	1
or	1
Chaldean.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
rare	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
requireth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
except	1
the	1
gods,	1
whose	1
dwelling	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
flesh.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
very	1
furious,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
decree	1
went	1
forth	1
that	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
slain;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
to	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
with	1
counsel	1
and	1
wisdom	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
guard,	1
which	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
2:15	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
king's	1
captain,	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
so	1
hasty	1
from	1
the	1
king?	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Daniel.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
his	1
companions:	1
2:18	1
That	1
they	1
would	1
desire	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
concerning	1
this	1
secret;	1
that	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
should	1
not	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:19	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
secret	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
in	1
a	1
night	1
vision.	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
blessed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:20	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
for	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might	1
are	1
his:	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
changeth	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons:	1
he	1
removeth	1
kings,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
kings:	1
he	1
giveth	1
wisdom	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
understanding:	1
2:22	1
He	1
revealeth	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
secret	1
things:	1
he	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:23	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
and	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
who	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
what	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
now	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
king's	1
matter.	1
	1
2:24	1
Therefore	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Arioch,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
ordained	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him;	1
Destroy	1
not	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
bring	1
me	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:25	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
brought	1
in	1
Daniel	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:26	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
Art	1
thou	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof?	1
	1
2:27	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
secret	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
demanded	1
cannot	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
soothsayers,	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
2:28	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets,	1
and	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
Thy	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
thy	1
head	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
are	1
these;	1
2:29	1
As	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
came	1
into	1
thy	1
mind	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
what	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
thee	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
2:30	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
this	1
secret	1
is	1
not	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
any	1
wisdom	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
living,	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
that	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
thy	1
heart.	1
	1
2:31	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
sawest,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
image.	1
This	1
great	1
image,	1
whose	1
brightness	1
was	1
excellent,	1
stood	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
thereof	1
was	1
terrible.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
image's	1
head	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
gold,	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
of	1
silver,	1
his	1
belly	1
and	1
his	1
thighs	1
of	1
brass,	1
2:33	1
His	1
legs	1
of	1
iron,	1
his	1
feet	1
part	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay.	1
	1
2:34	1
Thou	1
sawest	1
till	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
without	1
hands,	1
which	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
clay,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
to	1
pieces.	1
	1
2:35	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces	1
together,	1
and	1
became	1
like	1
the	1
chaff	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
threshingfloors;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
no	1
place	1
was	1
found	1
for	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
mountain,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
2:36	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
dream;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:37	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
art	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
kings:	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
power,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
dwell,	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
them	1
all.	1
Thou	1
art	1
this	1
head	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
after	1
thee	1
shall	1
arise	1
another	1
kingdom	1
inferior	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
another	1
third	1
kingdom	1
of	1
brass,	1
which	1
shall	1
bear	1
rule	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
as	1
iron:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
iron	1
breaketh	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
subdueth	1
all	1
things:	1
and	1
as	1
iron	1
that	1
breaketh	1
all	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
bruise.	1
	1
2:41	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
toes,	1
part	1
of	1
potters'	1
clay,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
divided;	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
iron,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
toes	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
were	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay,	1
so	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
partly	1
strong,	1
and	1
partly	1
broken.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay,	1
they	1
shall	1
mingle	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
cleave	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
iron	1
is	1
not	1
mixed	1
with	1
clay.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
these	1
kings	1
shall	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
which	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
other	1
people,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
consume	1
all	1
these	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:45	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
without	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold;	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
the	1
dream	1
is	1
certain,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
sure.	1
	1
2:46	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
offer	1
an	1
oblation	1
and	1
sweet	1
odours	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
2:47	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
a	1
Lord	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
a	1
revealer	1
of	1
secrets,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
couldest	1
reveal	1
this	1
secret.	1
	1
2:48	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
Daniel	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
many	1
great	1
gifts,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
governors	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:49	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
but	1
Daniel	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
an	1
image	1
of	1
gold,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
six	1
cubits:	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Dura,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
3:2	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:3	1
Then	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
an	1
herald	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
To	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
commanded,	1
O	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
3:5	1
That	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
set	1
up:	1
3:6	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
shall	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:7	1
Therefore	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
languages,	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:8	1
Wherefore	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
certain	1
Chaldeans	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
accused	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
3:9	1
They	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:10	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
hast	1
made	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image:	1
3:11	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:12	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
Jews	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego;	1
these	1
men,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
not	1
regarded	1
thee:	1
they	1
serve	1
not	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
in	1
his	1
rage	1
and	1
fury	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
these	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:14	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
true,	1
O	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
serve	1
my	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
up?	1
	1
3:15	1
Now	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
ready	1
that	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made;	1
well:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
worship	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace;	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
God	1
that	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hands?	1
	1
3:16	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
careful	1
to	1
answer	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
our	1
God	1
whom	1
we	1
serve	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:19	1
Then	1
was	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
full	1
of	1
fury,	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
visage	1
was	1
changed	1
against	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego:	1
therefore	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
heat	1
the	1
furnace	1
one	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
heated.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
most	1
mighty	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
bind	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:21	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
their	1
coats,	1
their	1
hosen,	1
and	1
their	1
hats,	1
and	1
their	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:22	1
Therefore	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was	1
urgent,	1
and	1
the	1
furnace	1
exceeding	1
hot,	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
slew	1
those	1
men	1
that	1
took	1
up	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
these	1
three	1
men,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
fell	1
down	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
astonied,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
counsellors,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
three	1
men	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
True,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
see	1
four	1
men	1
loose,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
hurt;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:26	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
Then	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
the	1
princes,	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
counsellors,	1
being	1
gathered	1
together,	1
saw	1
these	1
men,	1
upon	1
whose	1
bodies	1
the	1
fire	1
had	1
no	1
power,	1
nor	1
was	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
their	1
head	1
singed,	1
neither	1
were	1
their	1
coats	1
changed,	1
nor	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
fire	1
had	1
passed	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
3:28	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
who	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
trusted	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
changed	1
the	1
king's	1
word,	1
and	1
yielded	1
their	1
bodies,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
serve	1
nor	1
worship	1
any	1
god,	1
except	1
their	1
own	1
God.	1
	1
3:29	1
Therefore	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
every	1
people,	1
nation,	1
and	1
language,	1
which	1
speak	1
any	1
thing	1
amiss	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill:	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
God	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
after	1
this	1
sort.	1
	1
3:30	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
promoted	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king,	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
that	1
the	1
high	1
God	1
hath	1
wrought	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
4:3	1
How	1
great	1
are	1
his	1
signs!	1
and	1
how	1
mighty	1
are	1
his	1
wonders!	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
4:4	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
was	1
at	1
rest	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
in	1
my	1
palace:	1
4:5	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
afraid,	1
and	1
the	1
thoughts	1
upon	1
my	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
4:6	1
Therefore	1
made	1
I	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers:	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream	1
before	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:8	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
Daniel	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods:	1
and	1
before	1
him	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
secret	1
troubleth	1
thee,	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
dream	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:10	1
Thus	1
were	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
mine	1
head	1
in	1
my	1
bed;	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
tree	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:12	1
The	1
leaves	1
thereof	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all:	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
had	1
shadow	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
was	1
fed	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
bed,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
4:14	1
He	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
and	1
said	1
thus,	1
Hew	1
down	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
branches,	1
shake	1
off	1
his	1
leaves,	1
and	1
scatter	1
his	1
fruit:	1
let	1
the	1
beasts	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
from	1
his	1
branches:	1
4:15	1
Nevertheless	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
his	1
roots	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:16	1
Let	1
his	1
heart	1
be	1
changed	1
from	1
man's,	1
and	1
let	1
a	1
beast's	1
heart	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
let	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
matter	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
watchers,	1
and	1
the	1
demand	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
ones:	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
basest	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:18	1
This	1
dream	1
I	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
have	1
seen.	1
Now	1
thou,	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
declare	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
able;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
4:19	1
Then	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
was	1
astonied	1
for	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him.	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Belteshazzar,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
dream,	1
or	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
trouble	1
thee.	1
Belteshazzar	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
the	1
dream	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
to	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:20	1
The	1
tree	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
which	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
whose	1
height	1
reached	1
unto	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
4:21	1
Whose	1
leaves	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all;	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
upon	1
whose	1
branches	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
had	1
their	1
habitation:	1
4:22	1
It	1
is	1
thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
art	1
grown	1
and	1
become	1
strong:	1
for	1
thy	1
greatness	1
is	1
grown,	1
and	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
thy	1
dominion	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
whereas	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hew	1
the	1
tree	1
down,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it;	1
yet	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
till	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him;	1
4:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation,	1
O	1
king,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
4:25	1
That	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wet	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
till	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
whereas	1
they	1
commanded	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
roots;	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
sure	1
unto	1
thee,	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
heavens	1
do	1
rule.	1
	1
4:27	1
Wherefore,	1
O	1
king,	1
let	1
my	1
counsel	1
be	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
break	1
off	1
thy	1
sins	1
by	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquities	1
by	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
lengthening	1
of	1
thy	1
tranquillity.	1
	1
4:28	1
All	1
this	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
4:29	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
twelve	1
months	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:30	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
great	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
power,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
majesty?	1
	1
4:31	1
While	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
mouth,	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
O	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
to	1
thee	1
it	1
is	1
spoken;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:33	1
The	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
fulfilled	1
upon	1
Nebuchadnezzar:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
till	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
grown	1
like	1
eagles'	1
feathers,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
like	1
birds'	1
claws.	1
	1
4:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
mine	1
understanding	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
blessed	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
I	1
praised	1
and	1
honoured	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever,	1
whose	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation:	1
4:35	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
reputed	1
as	1
nothing:	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
stay	1
his	1
hand,	1
or	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
4:36	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
my	1
reason	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
mine	1
honour	1
and	1
brightness	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
my	1
counsellors	1
and	1
my	1
lords	1
sought	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
excellent	1
majesty	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:37	1
Now	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
praise	1
and	1
extol	1
and	1
honour	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
heaven,	1
all	1
whose	1
works	1
are	1
truth,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
judgment:	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
walk	1
in	1
pride	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
abase.	1
	1
5:1	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
his	1
lords,	1
and	1
drank	1
wine	1
before	1
the	1
thousand.	1
	1
5:2	1
Belshazzar,	1
whiles	1
he	1
tasted	1
the	1
wine,	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
golden	1
and	1
silver	1
vessels	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
that	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
might	1
drink	1
therein.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
golden	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
drank	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
drank	1
wine,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
of	1
brass,	1
of	1
iron,	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
5:5	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
came	1
forth	1
fingers	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hand,	1
and	1
wrote	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
candlestick	1
upon	1
the	1
plaister	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
palace:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
wrote.	1
	1
5:6	1
Then	1
the	1
king's	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
were	1
loosed,	1
and	1
his	1
knees	1
smote	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
king	1
cried	1
aloud	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:8	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
wise	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
nor	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
was	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
greatly	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
were	1
astonied.	1
	1
5:10	1
Now	1
the	1
queen	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
banquet	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
trouble	1
thee,	1
nor	1
let	1
thy	1
countenance	1
be	1
changed:	1
5:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
like	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
gods,	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
him;	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father,	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
say,	1
thy	1
father,	1
made	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
astrologers,	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
soothsayers;	1
5:12	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding,	1
interpreting	1
of	1
dreams,	1
and	1
shewing	1
of	1
hard	1
sentences,	1
and	1
dissolving	1
of	1
doubts,	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
Daniel,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
named	1
Belteshazzar:	1
now	1
let	1
Daniel	1
be	1
called,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Then	1
was	1
Daniel	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
my	1
father	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jewry?	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
excellent	1
wisdom	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
5:16	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
interpretations,	1
and	1
dissolve	1
doubts:	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
thy	1
gifts	1
be	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
give	1
thy	1
rewards	1
to	1
another;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
the	1
writing	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:18	1
O	1
thou	1
king,	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
gave	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
majesty,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour:	1
5:19	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
majesty	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him,	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
trembled	1
and	1
feared	1
before	1
him:	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
slew;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
kept	1
alive;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
put	1
down.	1
	1
5:20	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
hardened	1
in	1
pride,	1
he	1
was	1
deposed	1
from	1
his	1
kingly	1
throne,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
glory	1
from	1
him:	1
5:21	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
made	1
like	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
his	1
dwelling	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
asses:	1
they	1
fed	1
him	1
with	1
grass	1
like	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven;	1
till	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
ruled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
appointeth	1
over	1
it	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
thou	1
his	1
son,	1
O	1
Belshazzar,	1
hast	1
not	1
humbled	1
thine	1
heart,	1
though	1
thou	1
knewest	1
all	1
this;	1
5:23	1
But	1
hast	1
lifted	1
up	1
thyself	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
lords,	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
thy	1
concubines,	1
have	1
drunk	1
wine	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
of	1
brass,	1
iron,	1
wood,	1
and	1
stone,	1
which	1
see	1
not,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
know:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
thy	1
breath	1
is,	1
and	1
whose	1
are	1
all	1
thy	1
ways,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
glorified:	1
5:24	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
sent	1
from	1
him;	1
and	1
this	1
writing	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
writing	1
that	1
was	1
written,	1
MENE,	1
MENE,	1
TEKEL,	1
UPHARSIN.	1
	1
5:26	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
MENE;	1
God	1
hath	1
numbered	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
finished	1
it.	1
	1
5:27	1
TEKEL;	1
Thou	1
art	1
weighed	1
in	1
the	1
balances,	1
and	1
art	1
found	1
wanting.	1
	1
5:28	1
PERES;	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
is	1
divided,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
commanded	1
Belshazzar,	1
and	1
they	1
clothed	1
Daniel	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:30	1
In	1
that	1
night	1
was	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
slain.	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Darius	1
the	1
Median	1
took	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
being	1
about	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
6:1	1
It	1
pleased	1
Darius	1
to	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
kingdom	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
princes,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom;	1
6:2	1
And	1
over	1
these	1
three	1
presidents;	1
of	1
whom	1
Daniel	1
was	1
first:	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
might	1
give	1
accounts	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
damage.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
this	1
Daniel	1
was	1
preferred	1
above	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes,	1
because	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit	1
was	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thought	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
realm.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
sought	1
to	1
find	1
occasion	1
against	1
Daniel	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
none	1
occasion	1
nor	1
fault;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
faithful,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
error	1
or	1
fault	1
found	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
said	1
these	1
men,	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
any	1
occasion	1
against	1
this	1
Daniel,	1
except	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
against	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:6	1
Then	1
these	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
assembled	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
King	1
Darius,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:7	1
All	1
the	1
presidents	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
have	1
consulted	1
together	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
royal	1
statute,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
decree,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
for	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now,	1
O	1
king,	1
establish	1
the	1
decree,	1
and	1
sign	1
the	1
writing,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
changed,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:9	1
Wherefore	1
king	1
Darius	1
signed	1
the	1
writing	1
and	1
the	1
decree.	1
	1
6:10	1
Now	1
when	1
Daniel	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
signed,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
his	1
windows	1
being	1
open	1
in	1
his	1
chamber	1
toward	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
before	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
aforetime.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled,	1
and	1
found	1
Daniel	1
praying	1
and	1
making	1
supplication	1
before	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
concerning	1
the	1
king's	1
decree;	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
signed	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
within	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions?	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
true,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:13	1
Then	1
answered	1
they	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
That	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
regardeth	1
not	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
nor	1
the	1
decree	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
signed,	1
but	1
maketh	1
his	1
petition	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
the	1
king,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
was	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
on	1
Daniel	1
to	1
deliver	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
laboured	1
till	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
deliver	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Know,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians	1
is,	1
That	1
no	1
decree	1
nor	1
statute	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
establisheth	1
may	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
6:16	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Thy	1
God	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
brought,	1
and	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
den;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sealed	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
signet,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
signet	1
of	1
his	1
lords;	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
concerning	1
Daniel.	1
	1
6:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
palace,	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
fasting:	1
neither	1
were	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick	1
brought	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
went	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
6:19	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
den,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
lamentable	1
voice	1
unto	1
Daniel:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
is	1
thy	1
God,	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
lions?	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:22	1
My	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
the	1
lions'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hurt	1
me:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
before	1
him	1
innocency	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
me;	1
and	1
also	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
hurt.	1
	1
6:23	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
Daniel	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
So	1
Daniel	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den,	1
and	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
hurt	1
was	1
found	1
upon	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
accused	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions,	1
them,	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
wives;	1
and	1
the	1
lions	1
had	1
the	1
mastery	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
brake	1
all	1
their	1
bones	1
in	1
pieces	1
or	1
ever	1
they	1
came	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
	1
6:25	1
Then	1
king	1
Darius	1
wrote	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:26	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
dominion	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
men	1
tremble	1
and	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
stedfast	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
6:27	1
He	1
delivereth	1
and	1
rescueth,	1
and	1
he	1
worketh	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Daniel	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
lions.	1
	1
6:28	1
So	1
this	1
Daniel	1
prospered	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
Persian.	1
	1
7:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Belshazzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
Daniel	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
visions	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
upon	1
his	1
bed:	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
matters.	1
	1
7:2	1
Daniel	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
vision	1
by	1
night,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
strove	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
sea.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
four	1
great	1
beasts	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
diverse	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
had	1
eagle's	1
wings:	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
wings	1
thereof	1
were	1
plucked,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
made	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
feet	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
heart	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
behold	1
another	1
beast,	1
a	1
second,	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
it	1
raised	1
up	1
itself	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
three	1
ribs	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
it,	1
Arise,	1
devour	1
much	1
flesh.	1
	1
7:6	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
another,	1
like	1
a	1
leopard,	1
which	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
four	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
fowl;	1
the	1
beast	1
had	1
also	1
four	1
heads;	1
and	1
dominion	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:7	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
dreadful	1
and	1
terrible,	1
and	1
strong	1
exceedingly;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
great	1
iron	1
teeth:	1
it	1
devoured	1
and	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
horns,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
among	1
them	1
another	1
little	1
horn,	1
before	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
horns	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
in	1
this	1
horn	1
were	1
eyes	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
thrones	1
were	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
did	1
sit,	1
whose	1
garment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
snow,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
pure	1
wool:	1
his	1
throne	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
fiery	1
flame,	1
and	1
his	1
wheels	1
as	1
burning	1
fire.	1
	1
7:10	1
A	1
fiery	1
stream	1
issued	1
and	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
thousand	1
thousands	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
set,	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened.	1
	1
7:11	1
I	1
beheld	1
then	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
horn	1
spake:	1
I	1
beheld	1
even	1
till	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
slain,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
burning	1
flame.	1
	1
7:12	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
dominion	1
taken	1
away:	1
yet	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
prolonged	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
and	1
time.	1
	1
7:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
near	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
dominion,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
should	1
serve	1
him:	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
7:15	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
grieved	1
in	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
So	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
know	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
things.	1
	1
7:17	1
These	1
great	1
beasts,	1
which	1
are	1
four,	1
are	1
four	1
kings,	1
which	1
shall	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:18	1
But	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
7:19	1
Then	1
I	1
would	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
which	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
others,	1
exceeding	1
dreadful,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
were	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
of	1
brass;	1
which	1
devoured,	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
his	1
feet;	1
7:20	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
before	1
whom	1
three	1
fell;	1
even	1
of	1
that	1
horn	1
that	1
had	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
that	1
spake	1
very	1
great	1
things,	1
whose	1
look	1
was	1
more	1
stout	1
than	1
his	1
fellows.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
horn	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them;	1
7:22	1
Until	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
came,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
possessed	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:23	1
Thus	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
fourth	1
beast	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
earth,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
shall	1
tread	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
break	1
it	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
kingdom	1
are	1
ten	1
kings	1
that	1
shall	1
arise:	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
rise	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
subdue	1
three	1
kings.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
great	1
words	1
against	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
shall	1
wear	1
out	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
change	1
times	1
and	1
laws:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
until	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
dividing	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
the	1
judgment	1
shall	1
sit,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
dominion,	1
to	1
consume	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
whose	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
all	1
dominions	1
shall	1
serve	1
and	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
7:28	1
Hitherto	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
As	1
for	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
my	1
cogitations	1
much	1
troubled	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
countenance	1
changed	1
in	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
kept	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
unto	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
saw,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Shushan	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Elam;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Ulai.	1
	1
8:3	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
river	1
a	1
ram	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
horns	1
were	1
high;	1
but	1
one	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
higher	1
came	1
up	1
last.	1
	1
8:4	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
ram	1
pushing	1
westward,	1
and	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward;	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
beasts	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
became	1
great.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
considering,	1
behold,	1
an	1
he	1
goat	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
touched	1
not	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
goat	1
had	1
a	1
notable	1
horn	1
between	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
that	1
had	1
two	1
horns,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
close	1
unto	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
choler	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
brake	1
his	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
ram	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
the	1
ram	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
8:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
he	1
goat	1
waxed	1
very	1
great:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
strong,	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
was	1
broken;	1
and	1
for	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
four	1
notable	1
ones	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
horn,	1
which	1
waxed	1
exceeding	1
great,	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
it	1
waxed	1
great,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
8:11	1
Yea,	1
he	1
magnified	1
himself	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
was	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
was	1
cast	1
down.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
an	1
host	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
transgression,	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
it	1
practised,	1
and	1
prospered.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
I	1
heard	1
one	1
saint	1
speaking,	1
and	1
another	1
saint	1
said	1
unto	1
that	1
certain	1
saint	1
which	1
spake,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision	1
concerning	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
desolation,	1
to	1
give	1
both	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot?	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Unto	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
days;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
be	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
Daniel,	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
meaning,	1
then,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
man's	1
voice	1
between	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
Ulai,	1
which	1
called,	1
and	1
said,	1
Gabriel,	1
make	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:17	1
So	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
where	1
I	1
stood:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face:	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Understand,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground:	1
but	1
he	1
touched	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upright.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
know	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
indignation:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
8:20	1
The	1
ram	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
having	1
two	1
horns	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Media	1
and	1
Persia.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
rough	1
goat	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Grecia:	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
that	1
is	1
between	1
his	1
eyes	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
king.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
that	1
being	1
broken,	1
whereas	1
four	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
it,	1
four	1
kingdoms	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
kingdom,	1
when	1
the	1
transgressors	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
fierce	1
countenance,	1
and	1
understanding	1
dark	1
sentences,	1
shall	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
his	1
power	1
shall	1
be	1
mighty,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
wonderfully,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
and	1
practise,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
mighty	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
people.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
through	1
his	1
policy	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
craft	1
to	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
by	1
peace	1
shall	1
destroy	1
many:	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
princes;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
without	1
hand.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
is	1
true:	1
wherefore	1
shut	1
thou	1
up	1
the	1
vision;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
fainted,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
certain	1
days;	1
afterward	1
I	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
king's	1
business;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
vision,	1
but	1
none	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
9:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
9:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
I	1
Daniel	1
understood	1
by	1
books	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
whereof	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
accomplish	1
seventy	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
desolations	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
God,	1
to	1
seek	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplications,	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
ashes:	1
9:4	1
And	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
confession,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
God,	1
keeping	1
the	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments;	1
9:5	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
have	1
committed	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly,	1
and	1
have	1
rebelled,	1
even	1
by	1
departing	1
from	1
thy	1
precepts	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
9:6	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
spake	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
righteousness	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
confusion	1
of	1
faces,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
that	1
are	1
near,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
countries	1
whither	1
thou	1
hast	1
driven	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
trespass	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
trespassed	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:8	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
us	1
belongeth	1
confusion	1
of	1
face,	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
to	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:9	1
To	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
belong	1
mercies	1
and	1
forgivenesses,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
him;	1
9:10	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
laws,	1
which	1
he	1
set	1
before	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
9:11	1
Yea,	1
all	1
Israel	1
have	1
transgressed	1
thy	1
law,	1
even	1
by	1
departing,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
obey	1
thy	1
voice;	1
therefore	1
the	1
curse	1
is	1
poured	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
confirmed	1
his	1
words,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
against	1
our	1
judges	1
that	1
judged	1
us,	1
by	1
bringing	1
upon	1
us	1
a	1
great	1
evil:	1
for	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
as	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us:	1
yet	1
made	1
we	1
not	1
our	1
prayer	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
turn	1
from	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
understand	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
9:14	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
watched	1
upon	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
righteous	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
which	1
he	1
doeth:	1
for	1
we	1
obeyed	1
not	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Lord	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
hast	1
brought	1
thy	1
people	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
hast	1
gotten	1
thee	1
renown,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
we	1
have	1
sinned,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly.	1
	1
9:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
thine	1
anger	1
and	1
thy	1
fury	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
city	1
Jerusalem,	1
thy	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
because	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
become	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
9:17	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
our	1
God,	1
hear	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
his	1
supplications,	1
and	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
sanctuary	1
that	1
is	1
desolate,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:18	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold	1
our	1
desolations,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name:	1
for	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
our	1
supplications	1
before	1
thee	1
for	1
our	1
righteousnesses,	1
but	1
for	1
thy	1
great	1
mercies.	1
	1
9:19	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hear;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
forgive;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hearken	1
and	1
do;	1
defer	1
not,	1
for	1
thine	1
own	1
sake,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
thy	1
city	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking,	1
and	1
praying,	1
and	1
confessing	1
my	1
sin	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
presenting	1
my	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain	1
of	1
my	1
God;	1
9:21	1
Yea,	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
prayer,	1
even	1
the	1
man	1
Gabriel,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
vision	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
being	1
caused	1
to	1
fly	1
swiftly,	1
touched	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
oblation.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
he	1
informed	1
me,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
skill	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
9:23	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
thy	1
supplications	1
the	1
commandment	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
shew	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
beloved:	1
therefore	1
understand	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
9:24	1
Seventy	1
weeks	1
are	1
determined	1
upon	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
holy	1
city,	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
everlasting	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
to	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
vision	1
and	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
to	1
anoint	1
the	1
most	1
Holy.	1
	1
9:25	1
Know	1
therefore	1
and	1
understand,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
going	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
to	1
restore	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Messiah	1
the	1
Prince	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
weeks,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks:	1
the	1
street	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
wall,	1
even	1
in	1
troublous	1
times.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
after	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks	1
shall	1
Messiah	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
himself:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuary;	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
flood,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
desolations	1
are	1
determined.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
confirm	1
the	1
covenant	1
with	1
many	1
for	1
one	1
week:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
the	1
oblation	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
overspreading	1
of	1
abominations	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
desolate,	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
consummation,	1
and	1
that	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
desolate.	1
	1
10:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia	1
a	1
thing	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
true,	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
was	1
long:	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
thing,	1
and	1
had	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
10:2	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
mourning	1
three	1
full	1
weeks.	1
	1
10:3	1
I	1
ate	1
no	1
pleasant	1
bread,	1
neither	1
came	1
flesh	1
nor	1
wine	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
anoint	1
myself	1
at	1
all,	1
till	1
three	1
whole	1
weeks	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
which	1
is	1
Hiddekel;	1
10:5	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
whose	1
loins	1
were	1
girded	1
with	1
fine	1
gold	1
of	1
Uphaz:	1
10:6	1
His	1
body	1
also	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
beryl,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
in	1
colour	1
to	1
polished	1
brass,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
like	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
multitude.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
alone	1
saw	1
the	1
vision:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
quaking	1
fell	1
upon	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
to	1
hide	1
themselves.	1
	1
10:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
saw	1
this	1
great	1
vision,	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me:	1
for	1
my	1
comeliness	1
was	1
turned	1
in	1
me	1
into	1
corruption,	1
and	1
I	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:9	1
Yet	1
heard	1
I	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
then	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
10:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
an	1
hand	1
touched	1
me,	1
which	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
a	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
stand	1
upright:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
sent.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
stood	1
trembling.	1
	1
10:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
understand,	1
and	1
to	1
chasten	1
thyself	1
before	1
thy	1
God,	1
thy	1
words	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
for	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Persia	1
withstood	1
me	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
days:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
Michael,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
princes,	1
came	1
to	1
help	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
10:14	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
understand	1
what	1
shall	1
befall	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
words	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
dumb.	1
	1
10:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
touched	1
my	1
lips:	1
then	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
by	1
the	1
vision	1
my	1
sorrows	1
are	1
turned	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
this	1
my	1
lord	1
talk	1
with	1
this	1
my	1
lord?	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
straightway	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
breath	1
left	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
10:18	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
touched	1
me	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
strengthened	1
me,	1
10:19	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
fear	1
not:	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee,	1
be	1
strong,	1
yea,	1
be	1
strong.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
strengthened,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
speak;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
strengthened	1
me.	1
	1
10:20	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
wherefore	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Persia:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
forth,	1
lo,	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Grecia	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
noted	1
in	1
the	1
scripture	1
of	1
truth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
holdeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
Michael	1
your	1
prince.	1
	1
11:1	1
Also	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
Mede,	1
even	1
I,	1
stood	1
to	1
confirm	1
and	1
to	1
strengthen	1
him.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
truth.	1
Behold,	1
there	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
yet	1
three	1
kings	1
in	1
Persia;	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
richer	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
through	1
his	1
riches	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
all	1
against	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
Grecia.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
king	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
with	1
great	1
dominion,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
posterity,	1
nor	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
dominion	1
which	1
he	1
ruled:	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
plucked	1
up,	1
even	1
for	1
others	1
beside	1
those.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
princes;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
above	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
dominion;	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
dominion.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
years	1
they	1
shall	1
join	1
themselves	1
together;	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
agreement:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
retain	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
arm;	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand,	1
nor	1
his	1
arm:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
brought	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
begat	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
strengthened	1
her	1
in	1
these	1
times.	1
	1
11:7	1
But	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
her	1
roots	1
shall	1
one	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
shall	1
deal	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
prevail:	1
11:8	1
And	1
shall	1
also	1
carry	1
captives	1
into	1
Egypt	1
their	1
gods,	1
with	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
precious	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
gold;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
continue	1
more	1
years	1
than	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
11:9	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
assemble	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
great	1
forces:	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come,	1
and	1
overflow,	1
and	1
pass	1
through:	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
fortress.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
with	1
choler,	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
great	1
multitude;	1
but	1
the	1
multitude	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cast	1
down	1
many	1
ten	1
thousands:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
multitude	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
after	1
certain	1
years	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
riches.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
times	1
there	1
shall	1
many	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
also	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
exalt	1
themselves	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
11:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
cast	1
up	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
most	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
not	1
withstand,	1
neither	1
his	1
chosen	1
people,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
strength	1
to	1
withstand.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
which	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
11:17	1
He	1
shall	1
also	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
enter	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
upright	1
ones	1
with	1
him;	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
women,	1
corrupting	1
her:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
neither	1
be	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
11:18	1
After	1
this	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
isles,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
many:	1
but	1
a	1
prince	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
behalf	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
reproach	1
offered	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
cease;	1
without	1
his	1
own	1
reproach	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:19	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
fort	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
land:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
stumble	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
a	1
raiser	1
of	1
taxes	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
within	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
neither	1
in	1
anger,	1
nor	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
a	1
vile	1
person,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
peaceably,	1
and	1
obtain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
a	1
flood	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
overflown	1
from	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
yea,	1
also	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
league	1
made	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
shall	1
work	1
deceitfully:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
become	1
strong	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
people.	1
	1
11:24	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
peaceably	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
fattest	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
province;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
fathers	1
have	1
not	1
done,	1
nor	1
his	1
fathers'	1
fathers;	1
he	1
shall	1
scatter	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
spoil,	1
and	1
riches:	1
yea,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
forecast	1
his	1
devices	1
against	1
the	1
strong	1
holds,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
courage	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
army;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
forecast	1
devices	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
11:26	1
Yea,	1
they	1
that	1
feed	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
meat	1
shall	1
destroy	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
shall	1
overflow:	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
slain.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
kings'	1
hearts	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
do	1
mischief,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
lies	1
at	1
one	1
table;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:28	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
land	1
with	1
great	1
riches;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
exploits,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:29	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
he	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
toward	1
the	1
south;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
former,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Chittim	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
grieved,	1
and	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant:	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
intelligence	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
arms	1
shall	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pollute	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
strength,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
place	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
such	1
as	1
do	1
wickedly	1
against	1
the	1
covenant	1
shall	1
he	1
corrupt	1
by	1
flatteries:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
do	1
know	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
do	1
exploits.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
understand	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
instruct	1
many:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
flame,	1
by	1
captivity,	1
and	1
by	1
spoil,	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
11:34	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
holpen	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
help:	1
but	1
many	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
fall,	1
to	1
try	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
purge,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
white,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
and	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
every	1
god,	1
and	1
shall	1
speak	1
marvellous	1
things	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper	1
till	1
the	1
indignation	1
be	1
accomplished:	1
for	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
11:37	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
regard	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
women,	1
nor	1
regard	1
any	1
god:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
11:38	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
forces:	1
and	1
a	1
god	1
whom	1
his	1
fathers	1
knew	1
not	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
with	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
things.	1
	1
11:39	1
Thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
strong	1
holds	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
god,	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
and	1
increase	1
with	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
many,	1
and	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
gain.	1
	1
11:40	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
push	1
at	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
with	1
chariots,	1
and	1
with	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
ships;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
countries,	1
and	1
shall	1
overflow	1
and	1
pass	1
over.	1
	1
11:41	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
and	1
many	1
countries	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown:	1
but	1
these	1
shall	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
even	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:42	1
He	1
shall	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
countries:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
11:43	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
Libyans	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
11:44	1
But	1
tidings	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
trouble	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
great	1
fury	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
utterly	1
to	1
make	1
away	1
many.	1
	1
11:45	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
plant	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
his	1
palace	1
between	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
holy	1
mountain;	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
end,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
Michael	1
stand	1
up,	1
the	1
great	1
prince	1
which	1
standeth	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
was	1
since	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nation	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
same	1
time:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
awake,	1
some	1
to	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
everlasting	1
contempt.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
wise	1
shall	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
firmament;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
turn	1
many	1
to	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
12:4	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
words,	1
and	1
seal	1
the	1
book,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
many	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
be	1
increased.	1
	1
12:5	1
Then	1
I	1
Daniel	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
other	1
two,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
wonders?	1
12:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
when	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
times,	1
and	1
an	1
half;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
accomplished	1
to	1
scatter	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
people,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
finished.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
I	1
heard,	1
but	1
I	1
understood	1
not:	1
then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
closed	1
up	1
and	1
sealed	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
12:10	1
Many	1
shall	1
be	1
purified,	1
and	1
made	1
white,	1
and	1
tried;	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
do	1
wickedly:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
understand;	1
but	1
the	1
wise	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate	1
set	1
up,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
days.	1
	1
12:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
waiteth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
and	1
thirty	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
But	1
go	1
thou	1
thy	1
way	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
be:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest,	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
thy	1
lot	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Hosea	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
Hosea,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beeri,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Hosea.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Hosea,	1
Go,	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
hath	1
committed	1
great	1
whoredom,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
Gomer	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Diblaim;	1
which	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Jezreel;	1
for	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jezreel	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
daughter.	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
her	1
name	1
Loruhamah:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
take	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
bow,	1
nor	1
by	1
sword,	1
nor	1
by	1
battle,	1
by	1
horses,	1
nor	1
by	1
horsemen.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
weaned	1
Loruhamah,	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
God,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Loammi:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:10	1
Yet	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
measured	1
nor	1
numbered;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
appoint	1
themselves	1
one	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:1	1
Say	1
ye	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren,	1
Ammi;	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
sisters,	1
Ruhamah.	1
	1
2:2	1
Plead	1
with	1
your	1
mother,	1
plead:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
wife,	1
neither	1
am	1
I	1
her	1
husband:	1
let	1
her	1
therefore	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
sight,	1
and	1
her	1
adulteries	1
from	1
between	1
her	1
breasts;	1
2:3	1
Lest	1
I	1
strip	1
her	1
naked,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
slay	1
her	1
with	1
thirst.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
children;	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
their	1
mother	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot:	1
she	1
that	1
conceived	1
them	1
hath	1
done	1
shamefully:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
after	1
my	1
lovers,	1
that	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
bread	1
and	1
my	1
water,	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax,	1
mine	1
oil	1
and	1
my	1
drink.	1
	1
2:6	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
hedge	1
up	1
thy	1
way	1
with	1
thorns,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
wall,	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
paths.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
follow	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
seek	1
them,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
them:	1
then	1
shall	1
she	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
husband;	1
for	1
then	1
was	1
it	1
better	1
with	1
me	1
than	1
now.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
her	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
which	1
they	1
prepared	1
for	1
Baal.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
return,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
thereof,	1
and	1
my	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
recover	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax	1
given	1
to	1
cover	1
her	1
nakedness.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
discover	1
her	1
lewdness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
deliver	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
2:11	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cause	1
all	1
her	1
mirth	1
to	1
cease,	1
her	1
feast	1
days,	1
her	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
solemn	1
feasts.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
her	1
vines	1
and	1
her	1
fig	1
trees,	1
whereof	1
she	1
hath	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
my	1
rewards	1
that	1
my	1
lovers	1
have	1
given	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
eat	1
them.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Baalim,	1
wherein	1
she	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
decked	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
earrings	1
and	1
her	1
jewels,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
forgat	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
allure	1
her,	1
and	1
bring	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
speak	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
her	1
vineyards	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor	1
for	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
hope:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
sing	1
there,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
youth,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
Ishi;	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
no	1
more	1
Baali.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Baalim	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered	1
by	1
their	1
name.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
creeping	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
safely.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
ever;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
lovingkindness,	1
and	1
in	1
mercies.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
faithfulness:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
I	1
will	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
her	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
yet,	1
love	1
a	1
woman	1
beloved	1
of	1
her	1
friend,	1
yet	1
an	1
adulteress,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
toward	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
look	1
to	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
love	1
flagons	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
3:2	1
So	1
I	1
bought	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
fifteen	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
homer	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
homer	1
of	1
barley:	1
3:3	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
abide	1
for	1
me	1
many	1
days;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
another	1
man:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
be	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
abide	1
many	1
days	1
without	1
a	1
king,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
prince,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
image,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
without	1
teraphim:	1
3:5	1
Afterward	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
return,	1
and	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
David	1
their	1
king;	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
his	1
goodness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth,	1
nor	1
mercy,	1
nor	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
By	1
swearing,	1
and	1
lying,	1
and	1
killing,	1
and	1
stealing,	1
and	1
committing	1
adultery,	1
they	1
break	1
out,	1
and	1
blood	1
toucheth	1
blood.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
mourn,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein	1
shall	1
languish,	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven;	1
yea,	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
4:4	1
Yet	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
strive,	1
nor	1
reprove	1
another:	1
for	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
4:6	1
My	1
people	1
are	1
destroyed	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
knowledge,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
reject	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
no	1
priest	1
to	1
me:	1
seeing	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
forget	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
4:7	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
increased,	1
so	1
they	1
sinned	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
change	1
their	1
glory	1
into	1
shame.	1
	1
4:8	1
They	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
their	1
heart	1
on	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be,	1
like	1
people,	1
like	1
priest:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
ways,	1
and	1
reward	1
them	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
enough:	1
they	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
increase:	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
Whoredom	1
and	1
wine	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:12	1
My	1
people	1
ask	1
counsel	1
at	1
their	1
stocks,	1
and	1
their	1
staff	1
declareth	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
hath	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
hills,	1
under	1
oaks	1
and	1
poplars	1
and	1
elms,	1
because	1
the	1
shadow	1
thereof	1
is	1
good:	1
therefore	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
your	1
spouses	1
shall	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
punish	1
your	1
daughters	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
nor	1
your	1
spouses	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
for	1
themselves	1
are	1
separated	1
with	1
whores,	1
and	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
harlots:	1
therefore	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
doth	1
not	1
understand	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
4:15	1
Though	1
thou,	1
Israel,	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
yet	1
let	1
not	1
Judah	1
offend;	1
and	1
come	1
not	1
ye	1
unto	1
Gilgal,	1
neither	1
go	1
ye	1
up	1
to	1
Bethaven,	1
nor	1
swear,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
Israel	1
slideth	1
back	1
as	1
a	1
backsliding	1
heifer:	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
place.	1
	1
4:17	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
idols:	1
let	1
him	1
alone.	1
	1
4:18	1
Their	1
drink	1
is	1
sour:	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
whoredom	1
continually:	1
her	1
rulers	1
with	1
shame	1
do	1
love,	1
Give	1
ye.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
wind	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this,	1
O	1
priests;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
give	1
ye	1
ear,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
judgment	1
is	1
toward	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
snare	1
on	1
Mizpah,	1
and	1
a	1
net	1
spread	1
upon	1
Tabor.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
the	1
revolters	1
are	1
profound	1
to	1
make	1
slaughter,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
rebuker	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
5:3	1
I	1
know	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
me:	1
for	1
now,	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
thou	1
committest	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
will	1
not	1
frame	1
their	1
doings	1
to	1
turn	1
unto	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
doth	1
testify	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
Israel	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
fall	1
in	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:6	1
They	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
herds	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him;	1
he	1
hath	1
withdrawn	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
5:7	1
They	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
begotten	1
strange	1
children:	1
now	1
shall	1
a	1
month	1
devour	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
portions.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Ramah:	1
cry	1
aloud	1
at	1
Bethaven,	1
after	1
thee,	1
O	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
5:9	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
rebuke:	1
among	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
known	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
surely	1
be.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
like	1
them	1
that	1
remove	1
the	1
bound:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
wrath	1
upon	1
them	1
like	1
water.	1
	1
5:11	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
oppressed	1
and	1
broken	1
in	1
judgment,	1
because	1
he	1
willingly	1
walked	1
after	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
5:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
moth,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
as	1
rottenness.	1
	1
5:13	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
saw	1
his	1
sickness,	1
and	1
Judah	1
saw	1
his	1
wound,	1
then	1
went	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
yet	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
heal	1
you,	1
nor	1
cure	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
wound.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
tear	1
and	1
go	1
away;	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
rescue	1
him.	1
	1
5:15	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
place,	1
till	1
they	1
acknowledge	1
their	1
offence,	1
and	1
seek	1
my	1
face:	1
in	1
their	1
affliction	1
they	1
will	1
seek	1
me	1
early.	1
	1
6:1	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
torn,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
heal	1
us;	1
he	1
hath	1
smitten,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
bind	1
us	1
up.	1
	1
6:2	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
will	1
he	1
revive	1
us:	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
will	1
raise	1
us	1
up,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
we	1
know,	1
if	1
we	1
follow	1
on	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
LORD:	1
his	1
going	1
forth	1
is	1
prepared	1
as	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
the	1
rain,	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
former	1
rain	1
unto	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
O	1
Judah,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
for	1
your	1
goodness	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
morning	1
cloud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
it	1
goeth	1
away.	1
	1
6:5	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hewed	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
prophets;	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth:	1
and	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
6:6	1
For	1
I	1
desired	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice;	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
than	1
burnt	1
offerings.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
they	1
like	1
men	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
covenant:	1
there	1
have	1
they	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:8	1
Gilead	1
is	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
is	1
polluted	1
with	1
blood.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
as	1
troops	1
of	1
robbers	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
priests	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
consent:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
lewdness.	1
	1
6:10	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
horrible	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
whoredom	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
6:11	1
Also,	1
O	1
Judah,	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
an	1
harvest	1
for	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
When	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
healed	1
Israel,	1
then	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
falsehood;	1
and	1
the	1
thief	1
cometh	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
troop	1
of	1
robbers	1
spoileth	1
without.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
they	1
consider	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
I	1
remember	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness:	1
now	1
their	1
own	1
doings	1
have	1
beset	1
them	1
about;	1
they	1
are	1
before	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
7:3	1
They	1
make	1
the	1
king	1
glad	1
with	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
with	1
their	1
lies.	1
	1
7:4	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
adulterers,	1
as	1
an	1
oven	1
heated	1
by	1
the	1
baker,	1
who	1
ceaseth	1
from	1
raising	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
kneaded	1
the	1
dough,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
leavened.	1
	1
7:5	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
king	1
the	1
princes	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
sick	1
with	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine;	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
scorners.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
ready	1
their	1
heart	1
like	1
an	1
oven,	1
whiles	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait:	1
their	1
baker	1
sleepeth	1
all	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
burneth	1
as	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire.	1
	1
7:7	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
hot	1
as	1
an	1
oven,	1
and	1
have	1
devoured	1
their	1
judges;	1
all	1
their	1
kings	1
are	1
fallen:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
calleth	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Ephraim,	1
he	1
hath	1
mixed	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
a	1
cake	1
not	1
turned.	1
	1
7:9	1
Strangers	1
have	1
devoured	1
his	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not:	1
yea,	1
gray	1
hairs	1
are	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
upon	1
him,	1
yet	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
testifieth	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
nor	1
seek	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
7:11	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
silly	1
dove	1
without	1
heart:	1
they	1
call	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:12	1
When	1
they	1
shall	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
my	1
net	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven;	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
them,	1
as	1
their	1
congregation	1
hath	1
heard.	1
	1
7:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
me:	1
destruction	1
unto	1
them!	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
cried	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
when	1
they	1
howled	1
upon	1
their	1
beds:	1
they	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
for	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
they	1
rebel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:15	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
bound	1
and	1
strengthened	1
their	1
arms,	1
yet	1
do	1
they	1
imagine	1
mischief	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
return,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High:	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
deceitful	1
bow:	1
their	1
princes	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
for	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
their	1
tongue:	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
derision	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:1	1
Set	1
the	1
trumpet	1
to	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
as	1
an	1
eagle	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
trespassed	1
against	1
my	1
law.	1
	1
8:2	1
Israel	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
God,	1
we	1
know	1
thee.	1
	1
8:3	1
Israel	1
hath	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
good:	1
the	1
enemy	1
shall	1
pursue	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
They	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
kings,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
princes,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not:	1
of	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
have	1
they	1
made	1
them	1
idols,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
8:5	1
Thy	1
calf,	1
O	1
Samaria,	1
hath	1
cast	1
thee	1
off;	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
kindled	1
against	1
them:	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
they	1
attain	1
to	1
innocency?	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
from	1
Israel	1
was	1
it	1
also:	1
the	1
workman	1
made	1
it;	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
sown	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1
stalk;	1
the	1
bud	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meal:	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
yield,	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
swallow	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
Israel	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up:	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Assyria,	1
a	1
wild	1
ass	1
alone	1
by	1
himself:	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
hired	1
lovers.	1
	1
8:10	1
Yea,	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
hired	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sorrow	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
princes.	1
	1
8:11	1
Because	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
made	1
many	1
altars	1
to	1
sin,	1
altars	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
8:12	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
law,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
as	1
a	1
strange	1
thing.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
mine	1
offerings,	1
and	1
eat	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
accepteth	1
them	1
not;	1
now	1
will	1
he	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
visit	1
their	1
sins:	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
Israel	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
his	1
Maker,	1
and	1
buildeth	1
temples;	1
and	1
Judah	1
hath	1
multiplied	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
9:1	1
Rejoice	1
not,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
for	1
joy,	1
as	1
other	1
people:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
a	1
reward	1
upon	1
every	1
cornfloor.	1
	1
9:2	1
The	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
winepress	1
shall	1
not	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
shall	1
fail	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
9:3	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
land;	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
unclean	1
things	1
in	1
Assyria.	1
	1
9:4	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
wine	1
offerings	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
him:	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
mourners;	1
all	1
that	1
eat	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
polluted:	1
for	1
their	1
bread	1
for	1
their	1
soul	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:5	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
day,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
9:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
because	1
of	1
destruction:	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
up,	1
Memphis	1
shall	1
bury	1
them:	1
the	1
pleasant	1
places	1
for	1
their	1
silver,	1
nettles	1
shall	1
possess	1
them:	1
thorns	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
9:7	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
visitation	1
are	1
come,	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
recompence	1
are	1
come;	1
Israel	1
shall	1
know	1
it:	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
fool,	1
the	1
spiritual	1
man	1
is	1
mad,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
hatred.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
watchman	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
snare	1
of	1
a	1
fowler	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
9:9	1
They	1
have	1
deeply	1
corrupted	1
themselves,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
9:10	1
I	1
found	1
Israel	1
like	1
grapes	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
I	1
saw	1
your	1
fathers	1
as	1
the	1
firstripe	1
in	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
time:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Baalpeor,	1
and	1
separated	1
themselves	1
unto	1
that	1
shame;	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
were	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
loved.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
Ephraim,	1
their	1
glory	1
shall	1
fly	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
bird,	1
from	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
conception.	1
	1
9:12	1
Though	1
they	1
bring	1
up	1
their	1
children,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
bereave	1
them,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
left:	1
yea,	1
woe	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
I	1
depart	1
from	1
them!	1
	1
9:13	1
Ephraim,	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
Tyrus,	1
is	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
place:	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
his	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
murderer.	1
	1
9:14	1
Give	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give?	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
miscarrying	1
womb	1
and	1
dry	1
breasts.	1
	1
9:15	1
All	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
in	1
Gilgal:	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
hated	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
doings	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
no	1
more:	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
are	1
revolters.	1
	1
9:16	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
smitten,	1
their	1
root	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit:	1
yea,	1
though	1
they	1
bring	1
forth,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
slay	1
even	1
the	1
beloved	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
womb.	1
	1
9:17	1
My	1
God	1
will	1
cast	1
them	1
away,	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
wanderers	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
10:1	1
Israel	1
is	1
an	1
empty	1
vine,	1
he	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
himself:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
fruit	1
he	1
hath	1
increased	1
the	1
altars;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
goodly	1
images.	1
	1
10:2	1
Their	1
heart	1
is	1
divided;	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
found	1
faulty:	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
altars,	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
their	1
images.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
now	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king,	1
because	1
we	1
feared	1
not	1
the	1
LORD;	1
what	1
then	1
should	1
a	1
king	1
do	1
to	1
us?	1
	1
10:4	1
They	1
have	1
spoken	1
words,	1
swearing	1
falsely	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
covenant:	1
thus	1
judgment	1
springeth	1
up	1
as	1
hemlock	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:5	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
Bethaven:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
thereof	1
shall	1
mourn	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
that	1
rejoiced	1
on	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
thereof,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
10:6	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
carried	1
unto	1
Assyria	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
receive	1
shame,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
counsel.	1
	1
10:7	1
As	1
for	1
Samaria,	1
her	1
king	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
the	1
foam	1
upon	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
10:8	1
The	1
high	1
places	1
also	1
of	1
Aven,	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
the	1
thorn	1
and	1
the	1
thistle	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
their	1
altars;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Cover	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
10:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
sinned	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
there	1
they	1
stood:	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
iniquity	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
them.	1
	1
10:10	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
chastise	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
against	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
bind	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
two	1
furrows.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
heifer	1
that	1
is	1
taught,	1
and	1
loveth	1
to	1
tread	1
out	1
the	1
corn;	1
but	1
I	1
passed	1
over	1
upon	1
her	1
fair	1
neck:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
ride;	1
Judah	1
shall	1
plow,	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
break	1
his	1
clods.	1
	1
10:12	1
Sow	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
reap	1
in	1
mercy;	1
break	1
up	1
your	1
fallow	1
ground:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
till	1
he	1
come	1
and	1
rain	1
righteousness	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
10:13	1
Ye	1
have	1
plowed	1
wickedness,	1
ye	1
have	1
reaped	1
iniquity;	1
ye	1
have	1
eaten	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
lies:	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
trust	1
in	1
thy	1
way,	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
10:14	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
a	1
tumult	1
arise	1
among	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
fortresses	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled,	1
as	1
Shalman	1
spoiled	1
Betharbel	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle:	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
upon	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
10:15	1
So	1
shall	1
Bethel	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
wickedness:	1
in	1
a	1
morning	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
utterly	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:1	1
When	1
Israel	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
then	1
I	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
my	1
son	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
11:2	1
As	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
from	1
them:	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
11:3	1
I	1
taught	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
to	1
go,	1
taking	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
arms;	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
I	1
drew	1
them	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
with	1
bands	1
of	1
love:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
yoke	1
on	1
their	1
jaws,	1
and	1
I	1
laid	1
meat	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
11:5	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
king,	1
because	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
abide	1
on	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
his	1
branches,	1
and	1
devour	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
counsels.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
bent	1
to	1
backsliding	1
from	1
me:	1
though	1
they	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
none	1
at	1
all	1
would	1
exalt	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
up,	1
Ephraim?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
Israel?	1
	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
Admah?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
Zeboim?	1
mine	1
heart	1
is	1
turned	1
within	1
me,	1
my	1
repentings	1
are	1
kindled	1
together.	1
	1
11:9	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
execute	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
mine	1
anger,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
destroy	1
Ephraim:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
man;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:10	1
They	1
shall	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
roar,	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
tremble	1
from	1
the	1
west.	1
	1
11:11	1
They	1
shall	1
tremble	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
dove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
houses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
Ephraim	1
compasseth	1
me	1
about	1
with	1
lies,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
deceit:	1
but	1
Judah	1
yet	1
ruleth	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
faithful	1
with	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
12:1	1
Ephraim	1
feedeth	1
on	1
wind,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
the	1
east	1
wind:	1
he	1
daily	1
increaseth	1
lies	1
and	1
desolation;	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
and	1
oil	1
is	1
carried	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
also	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
punish	1
Jacob	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways;	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
doings	1
will	1
he	1
recompense	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
brother	1
by	1
the	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
with	1
God:	1
12:4	1
Yea,	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
prevailed:	1
he	1
wept,	1
and	1
made	1
supplication	1
unto	1
him:	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
us;	1
12:5	1
Even	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
memorial.	1
	1
12:6	1
Therefore	1
turn	1
thou	1
to	1
thy	1
God:	1
keep	1
mercy	1
and	1
judgment	1
and	1
wait	1
on	1
thy	1
God	1
continually.	1
	1
12:7	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
merchant,	1
the	1
balances	1
of	1
deceit	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
he	1
loveth	1
to	1
oppress.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
said,	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
rich,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
me	1
out	1
substance:	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
labours	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
none	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
were	1
sin.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
yet	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
tabernacles,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
solemn	1
feast.	1
	1
12:10	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
multiplied	1
visions,	1
and	1
used	1
similitudes,	1
by	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
12:11	1
Is	1
there	1
iniquity	1
in	1
Gilead?	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
vanity:	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
bullocks	1
in	1
Gilgal;	1
yea,	1
their	1
altars	1
are	1
as	1
heaps	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
fields.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
Jacob	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Israel	1
served	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
kept	1
sheep.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
was	1
he	1
preserved.	1
	1
12:14	1
Ephraim	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
most	1
bitterly:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
leave	1
his	1
blood	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
reproach	1
shall	1
his	1
LORD	1
return	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:1	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
spake	1
trembling,	1
he	1
exalted	1
himself	1
in	1
Israel;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
offended	1
in	1
Baal,	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
sin	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
molten	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
silver,	1
and	1
idols	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
understanding,	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
craftsmen:	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
them,	1
Let	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
kiss	1
the	1
calves.	1
	1
13:3	1
Therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
cloud	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
that	1
passeth	1
away,	1
as	1
the	1
chaff	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney.	1
	1
13:4	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
no	1
god	1
but	1
me:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saviour	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
did	1
know	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
great	1
drought.	1
	1
13:6	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
pasture,	1
so	1
were	1
they	1
filled;	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
exalted;	1
therefore	1
have	1
they	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lion:	1
as	1
a	1
leopard	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
will	1
I	1
observe	1
them:	1
13:8	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
that	1
is	1
bereaved	1
of	1
her	1
whelps,	1
and	1
will	1
rend	1
the	1
caul	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
devour	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
shall	1
tear	1
them.	1
	1
13:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thyself;	1
but	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
thine	1
help.	1
	1
13:10	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
king:	1
where	1
is	1
any	1
other	1
that	1
may	1
save	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
cities?	1
and	1
thy	1
judges	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
princes?	1
	1
13:11	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
in	1
my	1
wrath.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
bound	1
up;	1
his	1
sin	1
is	1
hid.	1
	1
13:13	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
a	1
travailing	1
woman	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him:	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
unwise	1
son;	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
breaking	1
forth	1
of	1
children.	1
	1
13:14	1
I	1
will	1
ransom	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
grave;	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
death:	1
O	1
death,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
plagues;	1
O	1
grave,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
destruction:	1
repentance	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
13:15	1
Though	1
he	1
be	1
fruitful	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
shall	1
come,	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
his	1
spring	1
shall	1
become	1
dry,	1
and	1
his	1
fountain	1
shall	1
be	1
dried	1
up:	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
all	1
pleasant	1
vessels.	1
	1
13:16	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
become	1
desolate;	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
her	1
God:	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
their	1
infants	1
shall	1
be	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
ripped	1
up.	1
	1
14:1	1
O	1
israel,	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
fallen	1
by	1
thine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
14:2	1
Take	1
with	1
you	1
words,	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
away	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
receive	1
us	1
graciously:	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
render	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
our	1
lips.	1
	1
14:3	1
Asshur	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
us;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses:	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
gods:	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
the	1
fatherless	1
findeth	1
mercy.	1
	1
14:4	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
their	1
backsliding,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
freely:	1
for	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
unto	1
Israel:	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
lily,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
his	1
roots	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:6	1
His	1
branches	1
shall	1
spread,	1
and	1
his	1
beauty	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
and	1
his	1
smell	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:7	1
They	1
that	1
dwell	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
shall	1
return;	1
they	1
shall	1
revive	1
as	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
vine:	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:8	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
idols?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
observed	1
him:	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
fir	1
tree.	1
From	1
me	1
is	1
thy	1
fruit	1
found.	1
	1
14:9	1
Who	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
understand	1
these	1
things?	1
prudent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
right,	1
and	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
fall	1
therein.	1
	1
	1

Joel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Joel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pethuel.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear	1
this,	1
ye	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
Hath	1
this	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
	1
1:3	1
Tell	1
ye	1
your	1
children	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
children	1
tell	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
another	1
generation.	1
	1
1:4	1
That	1
which	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
locust	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
caterpiller	1
eaten.	1
	1
1:5	1
Awake,	1
ye	1
drunkards,	1
and	1
weep;	1
and	1
howl,	1
all	1
ye	1
drinkers	1
of	1
wine,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
wine;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:6	1
For	1
a	1
nation	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
my	1
land,	1
strong,	1
and	1
without	1
number,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
are	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
the	1
cheek	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
lion.	1
	1
1:7	1
He	1
hath	1
laid	1
my	1
vine	1
waste,	1
and	1
barked	1
my	1
fig	1
tree:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
clean	1
bare,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
away;	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
are	1
made	1
white.	1
	1
1:8	1
Lament	1
like	1
a	1
virgin	1
girded	1
with	1
sackcloth	1
for	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
her	1
youth.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
ministers,	1
mourn.	1
	1
1:10	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
wasted,	1
the	1
land	1
mourneth;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
wasted:	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
the	1
oil	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:11	1
Be	1
ye	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
ye	1
husbandmen;	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
vinedressers,	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
barley;	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
is	1
perished.	1
	1
1:12	1
The	1
vine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
languisheth;	1
the	1
pomegranate	1
tree,	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
apple	1
tree,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
are	1
withered:	1
because	1
joy	1
is	1
withered	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:13	1
Gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
lament,	1
ye	1
priests:	1
howl,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
come,	1
lie	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
sackcloth,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
withholden	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
Sanctify	1
ye	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
gather	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
1:15	1
Alas	1
for	1
the	1
day!	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty	1
shall	1
it	1
come.	1
	1
1:16	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
meat	1
cut	1
off	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
yea,	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
1:17	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
rotten	1
under	1
their	1
clods,	1
the	1
garners	1
are	1
laid	1
desolate,	1
the	1
barns	1
are	1
broken	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
withered.	1
	1
1:18	1
How	1
do	1
the	1
beasts	1
groan!	1
the	1
herds	1
of	1
cattle	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
pasture;	1
yea,	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
are	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
1:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
cry:	1
for	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
hath	1
burned	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
1:20	1
The	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
cry	1
also	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:1	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
sound	1
an	1
alarm	1
in	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
tremble:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand;	1
2:2	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
of	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
of	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains:	1
a	1
great	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
strong;	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
ever	1
the	1
like,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
it,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
2:3	1
A	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
flame	1
burneth:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness;	1
yea,	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
escape	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
horses;	1
and	1
as	1
horsemen,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
run.	1
	1
2:5	1
Like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
chariots	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
mountains	1
shall	1
they	1
leap,	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
that	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble,	1
as	1
a	1
strong	1
people	1
set	1
in	1
battle	1
array.	1
	1
2:6	1
Before	1
their	1
face	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
pained:	1
all	1
faces	1
shall	1
gather	1
blackness.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
mighty	1
men;	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
men	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
march	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
their	1
ranks:	1
2:8	1
Neither	1
shall	1
one	1
thrust	1
another;	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
path:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
sword,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wounded.	1
	1
2:9	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
houses;	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
like	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
earth	1
shall	1
quake	1
before	1
them;	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
tremble:	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
dark,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining:	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
before	1
his	1
army:	1
for	1
his	1
camp	1
is	1
very	1
great:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
that	1
executeth	1
his	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
very	1
terrible;	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
it?	1
2:12	1
Therefore	1
also	1
now,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
turn	1
ye	1
even	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
mourning:	1
2:13	1
And	1
rend	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
not	1
your	1
garments,	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repenteth	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
2:14	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
leave	1
a	1
blessing	1
behind	1
him;	1
even	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God?	1
	1
2:15	1
Blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
sanctify	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly:	1
2:16	1
Gather	1
the	1
people,	1
sanctify	1
the	1
congregation,	1
assemble	1
the	1
elders,	1
gather	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
suck	1
the	1
breasts:	1
let	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
closet.	1
	1
2:17	1
Let	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
weep	1
between	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
say,	1
Spare	1
thy	1
people,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
give	1
not	1
thine	1
heritage	1
to	1
reproach,	1
that	1
the	1
heathen	1
should	1
rule	1
over	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
they	1
say	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
Where	1
is	1
their	1
God?	1
2:18	1
Then	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
jealous	1
for	1
his	1
land,	1
and	1
pity	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
2:19	1
Yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
you	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
therewith:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
2:20	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
you	1
the	1
northern	1
army,	1
and	1
will	1
drive	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
barren	1
and	1
desolate,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
hinder	1
part	1
toward	1
the	1
utmost	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
stink	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
ill	1
savour	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
Fear	1
not,	1
O	1
land;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:22	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
ye	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
for	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
do	1
spring,	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
beareth	1
her	1
fruit,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
vine	1
do	1
yield	1
their	1
strength.	1
	1
2:23	1
Be	1
glad	1
then,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
former	1
rain	1
moderately,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
you	1
the	1
rain,	1
the	1
former	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
floors	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
the	1
vats	1
shall	1
overflow	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
oil.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
eaten,	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
and	1
the	1
caterpiller,	1
and	1
the	1
palmerworm,	1
my	1
great	1
army	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
in	1
plenty,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
hath	1
dealt	1
wondrously	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
none	1
else:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh;	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams,	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions:	1
2:29	1
And	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
handmaids	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
will	1
I	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
pillars	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
2:31	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered:	1
for	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
remnant	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
3:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
3:2	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
gather	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
heritage	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
scattered	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
parted	1
my	1
land.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
boy	1
for	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
sold	1
a	1
girl	1
for	1
wine,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
drink.	1
	1
3:4	1
Yea,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me,	1
O	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Palestine?	1
will	1
ye	1
render	1
me	1
a	1
recompence?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
recompense	1
me,	1
swiftly	1
and	1
speedily	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head;	1
3:5	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
my	1
silver	1
and	1
my	1
gold,	1
and	1
have	1
carried	1
into	1
your	1
temples	1
my	1
goodly	1
pleasant	1
things:	1
3:6	1
The	1
children	1
also	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
ye	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
remove	1
them	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
3:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
ye	1
have	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head:	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sell	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sell	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Sabeans,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
far	1
off:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
3:9	1
Proclaim	1
ye	1
this	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
Prepare	1
war,	1
wake	1
up	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
draw	1
near;	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
up:	1
3:10	1
Beat	1
your	1
plowshares	1
into	1
swords	1
and	1
your	1
pruninghooks	1
into	1
spears:	1
let	1
the	1
weak	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
strong.	1
	1
3:11	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come,	1
all	1
ye	1
heathen,	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
round	1
about:	1
thither	1
cause	1
thy	1
mighty	1
ones	1
to	1
come	1
down,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
heathen	1
be	1
wakened,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat:	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
sit	1
to	1
judge	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
3:13	1
Put	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
ripe:	1
come,	1
get	1
you	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
press	1
is	1
full,	1
the	1
fats	1
overflow;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
3:14	1
Multitudes,	1
multitudes	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining.	1
	1
3:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
roar	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
shake:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:17	1
So	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
dwelling	1
in	1
Zion,	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
then	1
shall	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
holy,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
strangers	1
pass	1
through	1
her	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
down	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
waters,	1
and	1
a	1
fountain	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
water	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shittim.	1
	1
3:19	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness,	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
3:20	1
But	1
Judah	1
shall	1
dwell	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
3:21	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cleanse	1
their	1
blood	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
cleansed:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
Zion.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Amos	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Amos,	1
who	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Tekoa,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
roar	1
from	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel	1
shall	1
wither.	1
	1
1:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
threshed	1
Gilead	1
with	1
threshing	1
instruments	1
of	1
iron:	1
1:4	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Hazael,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Benhadad.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
also	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Aven,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eden:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Syria	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Kir,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity,	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
Edom:	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof:	1
1:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
Ekron:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
shall	1
perish,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity	1
to	1
Edom,	1
and	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
brotherly	1
covenant:	1
1:10	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
pursue	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
pity,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
did	1
tear	1
perpetually,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
wrath	1
for	1
ever:	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Teman,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Bozrah.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
ripped	1
up	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enlarge	1
their	1
border:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof,	1
with	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
with	1
a	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
1:15	1
And	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
burned	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
into	1
lime:	1
2:2	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Moab,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Kirioth:	1
and	1
Moab	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
tumult,	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet:	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
slay	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof	1
with	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
their	1
lies	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
after	1
the	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
walked:	1
2:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
sold	1
the	1
righteous	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
2:7	1
That	1
pant	1
after	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
meek:	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
same	1
maid,	1
to	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name:	1
2:8	1
And	1
they	1
lay	1
themselves	1
down	1
upon	1
clothes	1
laid	1
to	1
pledge	1
by	1
every	1
altar,	1
and	1
they	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
god.	1
	1
2:9	1
Yet	1
destroyed	1
I	1
the	1
Amorite	1
before	1
them,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
cedars,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
strong	1
as	1
the	1
oaks;	1
yet	1
I	1
destroyed	1
his	1
fruit	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
his	1
roots	1
from	1
beneath.	1
	1
2:10	1
Also	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
led	1
you	1
forty	1
years	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorite.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
I	1
raised	1
up	1
of	1
your	1
sons	1
for	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
for	1
Nazarites.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
even	1
thus,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
ye	1
gave	1
the	1
Nazarites	1
wine	1
to	1
drink;	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy	1
not.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
pressed	1
under	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
cart	1
is	1
pressed	1
that	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
sheaves.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
flight	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
swift,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
shall	1
not	1
strengthen	1
his	1
force,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
mighty	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
2:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand	1
that	1
handleth	1
the	1
bow;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
swift	1
of	1
foot	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
rideth	1
the	1
horse	1
deliver	1
himself.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
courageous	1
among	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
flee	1
away	1
naked	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
you,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
against	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
You	1
only	1
have	1
I	1
known	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
iniquities.	1
	1
3:3	1
Can	1
two	1
walk	1
together,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
agreed?	1
	1
3:4	1
Will	1
a	1
lion	1
roar	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
prey?	1
will	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
den,	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing?	1
	1
3:5	1
Can	1
a	1
bird	1
fall	1
in	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
where	1
no	1
gin	1
is	1
for	1
him?	1
	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
snare	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing	1
at	1
all?	1
	1
3:6	1
Shall	1
a	1
trumpet	1
be	1
blown	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
not	1
be	1
afraid?	1
	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
evil	1
in	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
done	1
it?	1
	1
3:7	1
Surely	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
do	1
nothing,	1
but	1
he	1
revealeth	1
his	1
secret	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
lion	1
hath	1
roared,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
fear?	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
who	1
can	1
but	1
prophesy?	1
	1
3:9	1
Publish	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
at	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
say,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
great	1
tumults	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
oppressed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
right,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
store	1
up	1
violence	1
and	1
robbery	1
in	1
their	1
palaces.	1
	1
3:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
An	1
adversary	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
thy	1
strength	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
palaces	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
As	1
the	1
shepherd	1
taketh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
two	1
legs,	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
an	1
ear;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Samaria	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
in	1
Damascus	1
in	1
a	1
couch.	1
	1
3:13	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
3:14	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
visit	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
upon	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
visit	1
the	1
altars	1
of	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
winter	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
summer	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
ivory	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
houses	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
end,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word,	1
ye	1
kine	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
oppress	1
the	1
poor,	1
which	1
crush	1
the	1
needy,	1
which	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
Bring,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
drink.	1
	1
4:2	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
his	1
holiness,	1
that,	1
lo,	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
hooks,	1
and	1
your	1
posterity	1
with	1
fishhooks.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
breaches,	1
every	1
cow	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
her;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
palace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:4	1
Come	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
transgress;	1
at	1
Gilgal	1
multiply	1
transgression;	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
your	1
tithes	1
after	1
three	1
years:	1
4:5	1
And	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
with	1
leaven,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
and	1
publish	1
the	1
free	1
offerings:	1
for	1
this	1
liketh	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
cleanness	1
of	1
teeth	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
cities,	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
places:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
withholden	1
the	1
rain	1
from	1
you,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
yet	1
three	1
months	1
to	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
one	1
city,	1
and	1
caused	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
another	1
city:	1
one	1
piece	1
was	1
rained	1
upon,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
whereupon	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
So	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
cities	1
wandered	1
unto	1
one	1
city,	1
to	1
drink	1
water;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
satisfied:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:9	1
I	1
have	1
smitten	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
mildew:	1
when	1
your	1
gardens	1
and	1
your	1
vineyards	1
and	1
your	1
fig	1
trees	1
and	1
your	1
olive	1
trees	1
increased,	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
devoured	1
them:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:10	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
among	1
you	1
the	1
pestilence	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
I	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
your	1
horses;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
stink	1
of	1
your	1
camps	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
your	1
nostrils:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
have	1
overthrown	1
some	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
firebrand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
burning:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:12	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
unto	1
thee,	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
thy	1
God,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:13	1
For,	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
formeth	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
createth	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
declareth	1
unto	1
man	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
thought,	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
morning	1
darkness,	1
and	1
treadeth	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
against	1
you,	1
even	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:2	1
The	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
fallen;	1
she	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
rise:	1
she	1
is	1
forsaken	1
upon	1
her	1
land;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
The	1
city	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
shall	1
leave	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
by	1
an	1
hundred	1
shall	1
leave	1
ten,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live:	1
5:5	1
But	1
seek	1
not	1
Bethel,	1
nor	1
enter	1
into	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
pass	1
not	1
to	1
Beersheba:	1
for	1
Gilgal	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
Bethel	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:6	1
Seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live;	1
lest	1
he	1
break	1
out	1
like	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
devour	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
quench	1
it	1
in	1
Bethel.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
who	1
turn	1
judgment	1
to	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
leave	1
off	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
5:8	1
Seek	1
him	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
and	1
Orion,	1
and	1
turneth	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
into	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
maketh	1
the	1
day	1
dark	1
with	1
night:	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
5:9	1
That	1
strengtheneth	1
the	1
spoiled	1
against	1
the	1
strong,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
spoiled	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
fortress.	1
	1
5:10	1
They	1
hate	1
him	1
that	1
rebuketh	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
they	1
abhor	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
uprightly.	1
	1
5:11	1
Forasmuch	1
therefore	1
as	1
your	1
treading	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
ye	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
burdens	1
of	1
wheat:	1
ye	1
have	1
built	1
houses	1
of	1
hewn	1
stone,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
ye	1
have	1
planted	1
pleasant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
manifold	1
transgressions	1
and	1
your	1
mighty	1
sins:	1
they	1
afflict	1
the	1
just,	1
they	1
take	1
a	1
bribe,	1
and	1
they	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
from	1
their	1
right.	1
	1
5:13	1
Therefore	1
the	1
prudent	1
shall	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
that	1
time;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
time.	1
	1
5:14	1
Seek	1
good,	1
and	1
not	1
evil,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
5:15	1
Hate	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
establish	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
5:16	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saith	1
thus;	1
Wailing	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
streets;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
highways,	1
Alas!	1
alas!	1
	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
husbandman	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
skilful	1
of	1
lamentation	1
to	1
wailing.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
vineyards	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
desire	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD!	1
to	1
what	1
end	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
you?	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light.	1
	1
5:19	1
As	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
did	1
flee	1
from	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear	1
met	1
him;	1
or	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
a	1
serpent	1
bit	1
him.	1
	1
5:20	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light?	1
even	1
very	1
dark,	1
and	1
no	1
brightness	1
in	1
it?	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
hate,	1
I	1
despise	1
your	1
feast	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smell	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
assemblies.	1
	1
5:22	1
Though	1
ye	1
offer	1
me	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
your	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
them:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
regard	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
your	1
fat	1
beasts.	1
	1
5:23	1
Take	1
thou	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
songs;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
melody	1
of	1
thy	1
viols.	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
let	1
judgment	1
run	1
down	1
as	1
waters,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
stream.	1
	1
5:25	1
Have	1
ye	1
offered	1
unto	1
me	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
offerings	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
5:26	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
your	1
Moloch	1
and	1
Chiun	1
your	1
images,	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god,	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:27	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
beyond	1
Damascus,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
are	1
named	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
came!	1
	1
6:2	1
Pass	1
ye	1
unto	1
Calneh,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
go	1
ye	1
to	1
Hamath	1
the	1
great:	1
then	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Gath	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
be	1
they	1
better	1
than	1
these	1
kingdoms?	1
or	1
their	1
border	1
greater	1
than	1
your	1
border?	1
6:3	1
Ye	1
that	1
put	1
far	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
cause	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
violence	1
to	1
come	1
near;	1
6:4	1
That	1
lie	1
upon	1
beds	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
stretch	1
themselves	1
upon	1
their	1
couches,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
lambs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
calves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
stall;	1
6:5	1
That	1
chant	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
viol,	1
and	1
invent	1
to	1
themselves	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
like	1
David;	1
6:6	1
That	1
drink	1
wine	1
in	1
bowls,	1
and	1
anoint	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
ointments:	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
6:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
captive	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
go	1
captive,	1
and	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
shall	1
be	1
removed.	1
	1
6:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
himself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
abhor	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
hate	1
his	1
palaces:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
there	1
remain	1
ten	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
house,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
uncle	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
him,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
with	1
thee?	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
No.	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
tongue:	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:11	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
commandeth,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
with	1
breaches,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
house	1
with	1
clefts.	1
	1
6:12	1
Shall	1
horses	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
rock?	1
will	1
one	1
plow	1
there	1
with	1
oxen?	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
turned	1
judgment	1
into	1
gall,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
into	1
hemlock:	1
6:13	1
Ye	1
which	1
rejoice	1
in	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought,	1
which	1
say,	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
taken	1
to	1
us	1
horns	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
strength?	1
	1
6:14	1
But,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
against	1
you	1
a	1
nation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
afflict	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hemath	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
7:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
formed	1
grasshoppers	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
shooting	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
growth;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
latter	1
growth	1
after	1
the	1
king's	1
mowings.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
eating	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
forgive,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:4	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
called	1
to	1
contend	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
devoured	1
the	1
great	1
deep,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
a	1
part.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
cease,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
This	1
also	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
7:7	1
Thus	1
he	1
shewed	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
upon	1
a	1
wall	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
plumbline,	1
with	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
plumbline.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuaries	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Bethel	1
sent	1
to	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Amos	1
hath	1
conspired	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
all	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
thus	1
Amos	1
saith,	1
Jeroboam	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
7:12	1
Also	1
Amaziah	1
said	1
unto	1
Amos,	1
O	1
thou	1
seer,	1
go,	1
flee	1
thee	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
there	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
there:	1
7:13	1
But	1
prophesy	1
not	1
again	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
Bethel:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
chapel,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
court.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Amos,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Amaziah,	1
I	1
was	1
no	1
prophet,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
a	1
prophet's	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
herdman,	1
and	1
a	1
gatherer	1
of	1
sycomore	1
fruit:	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
took	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hear	1
thou	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Thou	1
sayest,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
drop	1
not	1
thy	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Isaac.	1
	1
7:17	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
harlot	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
by	1
line;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
in	1
a	1
polluted	1
land:	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
8:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
end	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
shall	1
be	1
howlings	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
dead	1
bodies	1
in	1
every	1
place;	1
they	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
forth	1
with	1
silence.	1
	1
8:4	1
Hear	1
this,	1
O	1
ye	1
that	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
needy,	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
fail,	1
8:5	1
Saying,	1
When	1
will	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
be	1
gone,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sell	1
corn?	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
set	1
forth	1
wheat,	1
making	1
the	1
ephah	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
shekel	1
great,	1
and	1
falsifying	1
the	1
balances	1
by	1
deceit?	1
	1
8:6	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
buy	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
yea,	1
and	1
sell	1
the	1
refuse	1
of	1
the	1
wheat?	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
8:8	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
land	1
tremble	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
mourn	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
as	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
at	1
noon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
darken	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
day:	1
8:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
your	1
feasts	1
into	1
mourning,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
songs	1
into	1
lamentation;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
baldness	1
upon	1
every	1
head;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
as	1
a	1
bitter	1
day.	1
	1
8:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
not	1
a	1
famine	1
of	1
bread,	1
nor	1
a	1
thirst	1
for	1
water,	1
but	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
8:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
fair	1
virgins	1
and	1
young	1
men	1
faint	1
for	1
thirst.	1
	1
8:14	1
They	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thy	1
god,	1
O	1
Dan,	1
liveth;	1
and,	1
The	1
manner	1
of	1
Beersheba	1
liveth;	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
never	1
rise	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Smite	1
the	1
lintel	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
the	1
posts	1
may	1
shake:	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
all	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
he	1
that	1
fleeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
escapeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
9:2	1
Though	1
they	1
dig	1
into	1
hell,	1
thence	1
shall	1
mine	1
hand	1
take	1
them;	1
though	1
they	1
climb	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
down:	1
9:3	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel,	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
thence;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
serpent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bite	1
them:	1
9:4	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
slay	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
melt,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
mourn:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
like	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:6	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
buildeth	1
his	1
stories	1
in	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
hath	1
founded	1
his	1
troop	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
9:7	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Caphtor,	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
from	1
Kir?	1
9:8	1
Behold,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
sinful	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
it	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
saving	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
command,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sift	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
like	1
as	1
corn	1
is	1
sifted	1
in	1
a	1
sieve,	1
yet	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
grain	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:10	1
All	1
the	1
sinners	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
say,	1
The	1
evil	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
nor	1
prevent	1
us.	1
	1
9:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David	1
that	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
close	1
up	1
the	1
breaches	1
thereof;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
his	1
ruins,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old:	1
9:12	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
possess	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
doeth	1
this.	1
	1
9:13	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
plowman	1
shall	1
overtake	1
the	1
reaper,	1
and	1
the	1
treader	1
of	1
grapes	1
him	1
that	1
soweth	1
seed;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
melt.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
waste	1
cities,	1
and	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof;	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
make	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them	1
upon	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
pulled	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Obadiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
vision	1
of	1
Obadiah.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
concerning	1
Edom;	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
rumour	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
ambassador	1
is	1
sent	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
1:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
small	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
despised.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
pride	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
hath	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
whose	1
habitation	1
is	1
high;	1
that	1
saith	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
1:4	1
Though	1
thou	1
exalt	1
thyself	1
as	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
though	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
nest	1
among	1
the	1
stars,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
thieves	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
if	1
robbers	1
by	1
night,	1
(how	1
art	1
thou	1
cut	1
off!)	1
	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
stolen	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
enough?	1
if	1
the	1
grapegatherers	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
leave	1
some	1
grapes?	1
	1
1:6	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
Esau	1
searched	1
out!	1
how	1
are	1
his	1
hidden	1
things	1
sought	1
up!	1
	1
1:7	1
All	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
thy	1
confederacy	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
border:	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
thee	1
have	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
thee;	1
that	1
they	1
eat	1
thy	1
bread	1
have	1
laid	1
a	1
wound	1
under	1
thee:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
understanding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
understanding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men,	1
O	1
Teman,	1
shall	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
by	1
slaughter.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
thy	1
violence	1
against	1
thy	1
brother	1
Jacob	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
strangers	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
his	1
forces,	1
and	1
foreigners	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
gates,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
thou	1
wast	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
stranger;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
destruction;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
spoken	1
proudly	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
their	1
affliction	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity,	1
nor	1
have	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
their	1
substance	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
1:14	1
Neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
crossway,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
escape;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
heathen:	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
thee:	1
thy	1
reward	1
shall	1
return	1
upon	1
thine	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
drunk	1
upon	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
so	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
drink	1
continually,	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
swallow	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been.	1
	1
1:17	1
But	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
possess	1
their	1
possessions.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
a	1
flame,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau	1
for	1
stubble,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kindle	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
devour	1
them;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
remaining	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
shall	1
possess	1
Gilead.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
this	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
possess	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
even	1
unto	1
Zarephath;	1
and	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Sepharad,	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
saviours	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
mount	1
Zion	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Jonah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amittai,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
cry	1
against	1
it;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:3	1
But	1
Jonah	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
flee	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
going	1
to	1
Tarshish:	1
so	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
fare	1
thereof,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
it,	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
1:5	1
Then	1
the	1
mariners	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
cried	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
wares	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
to	1
lighten	1
it	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
Jonah	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
	1
1:6	1
So	1
the	1
shipmaster	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou,	1
O	1
sleeper?	1
arise,	1
call	1
upon	1
thy	1
God,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
think	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
fellow,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cast	1
lots,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us.	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
lots,	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Jonah.	1
	1
1:8	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us;	1
What	1
is	1
thine	1
occupation?	1
and	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
country?	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
people	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Hebrew;	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
1:10	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
men	1
exceedingly	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him.	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
this?	1
For	1
the	1
men	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
them.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
sea	1
may	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
us?	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
sea	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
1:13	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
men	1
rowed	1
hard	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
land;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
1:14	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
perish	1
for	1
this	1
man's	1
life,	1
and	1
lay	1
not	1
upon	1
us	1
innocent	1
blood:	1
for	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
done	1
as	1
it	1
pleased	1
thee.	1
	1
1:15	1
So	1
they	1
look	1
up	1
Jonah,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
ceased	1
from	1
her	1
raging.	1
	1
1:16	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
vows.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
prepared	1
a	1
great	1
fish	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
Jonah.	1
And	1
Jonah	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
Jonah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fish's	1
belly,	1
2:2	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
cried	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
mine	1
affliction	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me;	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
hell	1
cried	1
I,	1
and	1
thou	1
heardest	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
thou	1
hadst	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
all	1
thy	1
billows	1
and	1
thy	1
waves	1
passed	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sight;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
again	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
waters	1
compassed	1
me	1
about,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
soul:	1
the	1
depth	1
closed	1
me	1
round	1
about,	1
the	1
weeds	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
2:6	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottoms	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
bars	1
was	1
about	1
me	1
for	1
ever:	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
up	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
corruption,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
2:7	1
When	1
my	1
soul	1
fainted	1
within	1
me	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
my	1
prayer	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
thee,	1
into	1
thine	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:8	1
They	1
that	1
observe	1
lying	1
vanities	1
forsake	1
their	1
own	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thanksgiving;	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
vowed.	1
Salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
it	1
vomited	1
out	1
Jonah	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
it	1
the	1
preaching	1
that	1
I	1
bid	1
thee.	1
	1
3:3	1
So	1
Jonah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Now	1
Nineveh	1
was	1
an	1
exceeding	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
three	1
days'	1
journey.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Jonah	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
day's	1
journey,	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
said,	1
Yet	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown.	1
	1
3:5	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
sackcloth,	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
word	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Nineveh,	1
and	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
robe	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
ashes.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
and	1
published	1
through	1
Nineveh	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
nobles,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
beast,	1
herd	1
nor	1
flock,	1
taste	1
any	1
thing:	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
feed,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water:	1
3:8	1
But	1
let	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
unto	1
God:	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
turn	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
violence	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
3:9	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
if	1
God	1
will	1
turn	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
their	1
works,	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
from	1
their	1
evil	1
way;	1
and	1
God	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
it	1
displeased	1
Jonah	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
angry.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
my	1
saying,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
country?	1
Therefore	1
I	1
fled	1
before	1
unto	1
Tarshish:	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gracious	1
God,	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repentest	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
take,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry?	1
	1
4:5	1
So	1
Jonah	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
booth,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
shadow,	1
till	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
gourd,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
over	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
shadow	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
grief.	1
So	1
Jonah	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
gourd.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
worm	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
rose	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
it	1
smote	1
the	1
gourd	1
that	1
it	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
arise,	1
that	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
vehement	1
east	1
wind;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
beat	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
he	1
fainted,	1
and	1
wished	1
in	1
himself	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
to	1
Jonah,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
for	1
the	1
gourd?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry,	1
even	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
gourd,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
laboured,	1
neither	1
madest	1
it	1
grow;	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
night,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
a	1
night:	1
4:11	1
And	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
spare	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
are	1
more	1
then	1
sixscore	1
thousand	1
persons	1
that	1
cannot	1
discern	1
between	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
their	1
left	1
hand;	1
and	1
also	1
much	1
cattle?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Micah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Micah	1
the	1
Morasthite	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear,	1
all	1
ye	1
people;	1
hearken,	1
O	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
therein	1
is:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
be	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
1:3	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
tread	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
molten	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
valleys	1
shall	1
be	1
cleft,	1
as	1
wax	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
are	1
poured	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
Samaria?	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Judah?	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
1:6	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Samaria	1
as	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
plantings	1
of	1
a	1
vineyard:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
down	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof	1
into	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hires	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
thereof	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
desolate:	1
for	1
she	1
gathered	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot.	1
	1
1:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
wail	1
and	1
howl,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
stripped	1
and	1
naked:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
wailing	1
like	1
the	1
dragons,	1
and	1
mourning	1
as	1
the	1
owls.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
her	1
wound	1
is	1
incurable;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
Judah;	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
even	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:10	1
Declare	1
ye	1
it	1
not	1
at	1
Gath,	1
weep	1
ye	1
not	1
at	1
all:	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Aphrah	1
roll	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
1:11	1
Pass	1
ye	1
away,	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Saphir,	1
having	1
thy	1
shame	1
naked:	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zaanan	1
came	1
not	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Bethezel;	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
you	1
his	1
standing.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Maroth	1
waited	1
carefully	1
for	1
good:	1
but	1
evil	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:13	1
O	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
bind	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
the	1
swift	1
beast:	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
1:14	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
presents	1
to	1
Moreshethgath:	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Achzib	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:15	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
an	1
heir	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Mareshah:	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
Adullam	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Make	1
thee	1
bald,	1
and	1
poll	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
delicate	1
children;	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
baldness	1
as	1
the	1
eagle;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
2:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
devise	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
work	1
evil	1
upon	1
their	1
beds!	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
light,	1
they	1
practise	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
they	1
covet	1
fields,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
by	1
violence;	1
and	1
houses,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
away:	1
so	1
they	1
oppress	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
heritage.	1
	1
2:3	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
against	1
this	1
family	1
do	1
I	1
devise	1
an	1
evil,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
remove	1
your	1
necks;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
go	1
haughtily:	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
2:4	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
lament	1
with	1
a	1
doleful	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
say,	1
We	1
be	1
utterly	1
spoiled:	1
he	1
hath	1
changed	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
people:	1
how	1
hath	1
he	1
removed	1
it	1
from	1
me!	1
turning	1
away	1
he	1
hath	1
divided	1
our	1
fields.	1
	1
2:5	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
that	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
cord	1
by	1
lot	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:6	1
Prophesy	1
ye	1
not,	1
say	1
they	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prophesy	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
shame.	1
	1
2:7	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
named	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
straitened?	1
are	1
these	1
his	1
doings?	1
do	1
not	1
my	1
words	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
walketh	1
uprightly?	1
	1
2:8	1
Even	1
of	1
late	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
enemy:	1
ye	1
pull	1
off	1
the	1
robe	1
with	1
the	1
garment	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
pass	1
by	1
securely	1
as	1
men	1
averse	1
from	1
war.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
women	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
ye	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
pleasant	1
houses;	1
from	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
ye	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:10	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
depart;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
rest:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
polluted,	1
it	1
shall	1
destroy	1
you,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:11	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
falsehood	1
do	1
lie,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
of	1
strong	1
drink;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
assemble,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
all	1
of	1
thee;	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
gather	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
them	1
together	1
as	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
Bozrah,	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
fold:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
great	1
noise	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
2:13	1
The	1
breaker	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
by	1
it:	1
and	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
pass	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
O	1
heads	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ye	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:2	1
Who	1
hate	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
evil;	1
who	1
pluck	1
off	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
bones;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
also	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
flay	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
break	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
chop	1
them	1
in	1
pieces,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
pot,	1
and	1
as	1
flesh	1
within	1
the	1
caldron.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
them:	1
he	1
will	1
even	1
hide	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
behaved	1
themselves	1
ill	1
in	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
make	1
my	1
people	1
err,	1
that	1
bite	1
with	1
their	1
teeth,	1
and	1
cry,	1
Peace;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
not	1
into	1
their	1
mouths,	1
they	1
even	1
prepare	1
war	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
3:6	1
Therefore	1
night	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
divine;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
seers	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
confounded:	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
cover	1
their	1
lips;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:8	1
But	1
truly	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
power	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
of	1
might,	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
his	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
3:9	1
Hear	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
ye	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
abhor	1
judgment,	1
and	1
pervert	1
all	1
equity.	1
	1
3:10	1
They	1
build	1
up	1
Zion	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
iniquity.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
heads	1
thereof	1
judge	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
teach	1
for	1
hire,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
thereof	1
divine	1
for	1
money:	1
yet	1
will	1
they	1
lean	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
say,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
us?	1
none	1
evil	1
can	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
3:12	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
Zion	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
be	1
plowed	1
as	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
the	1
hills;	1
and	1
people	1
shall	1
flow	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
say,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
paths:	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
among	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
strong	1
nations	1
afar	1
off;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
beat	1
their	1
swords	1
into	1
plowshares,	1
and	1
their	1
spears	1
into	1
pruninghooks:	1
nation	1
shall	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
sword	1
against	1
nation,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
learn	1
war	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
sit	1
every	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
fig	1
tree;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
all	1
people	1
will	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
4:6	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
assemble	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted;	1
4:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
that	1
halted	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
far	1
off	1
a	1
strong	1
nation:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
from	1
henceforth,	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
it	1
come,	1
even	1
the	1
first	1
dominion;	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:9	1
Now	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
cry	1
out	1
aloud?	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
thee?	1
is	1
thy	1
counsellor	1
perished?	1
for	1
pangs	1
have	1
taken	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
4:10	1
Be	1
in	1
pain,	1
and	1
labour	1
to	1
bring	1
forth,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail:	1
for	1
now	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
even	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered;	1
there	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
redeem	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:11	1
Now	1
also	1
many	1
nations	1
are	1
gathered	1
against	1
thee,	1
that	1
say,	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
let	1
our	1
eye	1
look	1
upon	1
Zion.	1
	1
4:12	1
But	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
understand	1
they	1
his	1
counsel:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
sheaves	1
into	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
4:13	1
Arise	1
and	1
thresh,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thine	1
horn	1
iron,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
hoofs	1
brass:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
in	1
pieces	1
many	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consecrate	1
their	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
gather	1
thyself	1
in	1
troops,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
troops:	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
siege	1
against	1
us:	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
judge	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek.	1
	1
5:2	1
But	1
thou,	1
Bethlehem	1
Ephratah,	1
though	1
thou	1
be	1
little	1
among	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Judah,	1
yet	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
he	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
in	1
Israel;	1
whose	1
goings	1
forth	1
have	1
been	1
from	1
of	1
old,	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
5:3	1
Therefore	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
them	1
up,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
which	1
travaileth	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth:	1
then	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
abide:	1
for	1
now	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
great	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
peace,	1
when	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
land:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
tread	1
in	1
our	1
palaces,	1
then	1
shall	1
we	1
raise	1
against	1
him	1
seven	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
eight	1
principal	1
men.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
waste	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nimrod	1
in	1
the	1
entrances	1
thereof:	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
our	1
land,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
treadeth	1
within	1
our	1
borders.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
dew	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
showers	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
that	1
tarrieth	1
not	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep:	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
go	1
through,	1
both	1
treadeth	1
down,	1
and	1
teareth	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
deliver.	1
	1
5:9	1
Thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
horses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
chariots:	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
all	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
5:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
witchcrafts	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
soothsayers:	1
5:13	1
Thy	1
graven	1
images	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
thy	1
standing	1
images	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
worship	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
up	1
thy	1
groves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
thy	1
cities.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
vengeance	1
in	1
anger	1
and	1
fury	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen,	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard.	1
	1
6:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
now	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith;	1
Arise,	1
contend	1
thou	1
before	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
hills	1
hear	1
thy	1
voice.	1
	1
6:2	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
O	1
mountains,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
controversy,	1
and	1
ye	1
strong	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:3	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
wherein	1
have	1
I	1
wearied	1
thee?	1
testify	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
I	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
servants;	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
before	1
thee	1
Moses,	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
Miriam.	1
	1
6:5	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
remember	1
now	1
what	1
Balak	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
consulted,	1
and	1
what	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
answered	1
him	1
from	1
Shittim	1
unto	1
Gilgal;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
bow	1
myself	1
before	1
the	1
high	1
God?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
with	1
calves	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
old?	1
	1
6:7	1
Will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thousands	1
of	1
rams,	1
or	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
rivers	1
of	1
oil?	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
firstborn	1
for	1
my	1
transgression,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
soul?	1
	1
6:8	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
thee,	1
O	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
what	1
doth	1
the	1
LORD	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
justly,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
mercy,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
humbly	1
with	1
thy	1
God?	1
	1
6:9	1
The	1
LORD's	1
voice	1
crieth	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
wisdom	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
name:	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
Are	1
there	1
yet	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
the	1
scant	1
measure	1
that	1
is	1
abominable?	1
	1
6:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
count	1
them	1
pure	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
balances,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
bag	1
of	1
deceitful	1
weights?	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
thereof	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
is	1
deceitful	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
sick	1
in	1
smiting	1
thee,	1
in	1
making	1
thee	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
6:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat,	1
but	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
thy	1
casting	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
hold,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
deliver;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
deliverest	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
6:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sow,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
reap;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tread	1
the	1
olives,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
anoint	1
thee	1
with	1
oil;	1
and	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
drink	1
wine.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
Omri	1
are	1
kept,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
counsels;	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
an	1
hissing:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
the	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
as	1
the	1
grapegleanings	1
of	1
the	1
vintage:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
cluster	1
to	1
eat:	1
my	1
soul	1
desired	1
the	1
firstripe	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:2	1
The	1
good	1
man	1
is	1
perished	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
upright	1
among	1
men:	1
they	1
all	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
blood;	1
they	1
hunt	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
net.	1
	1
7:3	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
evil	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
earnestly,	1
the	1
prince	1
asketh,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
asketh	1
for	1
a	1
reward;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
man,	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
mischievous	1
desire:	1
so	1
they	1
wrap	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
brier:	1
the	1
most	1
upright	1
is	1
sharper	1
than	1
a	1
thorn	1
hedge:	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
watchmen	1
and	1
thy	1
visitation	1
cometh;	1
now	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
perplexity.	1
	1
7:5	1
Trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
a	1

put	1
ye	1
not	1
confidence	1
in	1
a	1
guide:	1
keep	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
lieth	1
in	1
thy	1

	1
7:6	1
For	1
the	1
son	1
dishonoureth	1
the	1
father,	1
the	1
daughter	1
riseth	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law;	1
a	1
man's	1
enemies	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
7:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation:	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
against	1
me,	1
O	1
mine	1
enemy:	1
when	1
I	1
fall,	1
I	1
shall	1
arise;	1
when	1
I	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
will	1
bear	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him,	1
until	1
he	1
plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
execute	1
judgment	1
for	1
me:	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
mine	1
enemy	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
her	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God?	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
her:	1
now	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
7:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thy	1
walls	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
built,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
decree	1
be	1
far	1
removed.	1
	1
7:12	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortified	1
cities,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortress	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
mountain	1
to	1
mountain.	1
	1
7:13	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
for	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
7:14	1
Feed	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
thy	1
rod,	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
thine	1
heritage,	1
which	1
dwell	1
solitarily	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Carmel:	1
let	1
them	1
feed	1
in	1
Bashan	1
and	1
Gilead,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
7:15	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
unto	1
him	1
marvellous	1
things.	1
	1
7:16	1
The	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
be	1
confounded	1
at	1
all	1
their	1
might:	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hand	1
upon	1
their	1
mouth,	1
their	1
ears	1
shall	1
be	1
deaf.	1
	1
7:17	1
They	1
shall	1
lick	1
the	1
dust	1
like	1
a	1
serpent,	1
they	1
shall	1
move	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
holes	1
like	1
worms	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
7:18	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
pardoneth	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
passeth	1
by	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
heritage?	1
he	1
retaineth	1
not	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
mercy.	1
	1
7:19	1
He	1
will	1
turn	1
again,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
us;	1
he	1
will	1
subdue	1
our	1
iniquities;	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
cast	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
7:20	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
perform	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
the	1
mercy	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sworn	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Nahum	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Nineveh.	1
The	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
Nahum	1
the	1
Elkoshite.	1
	1
1:2	1
God	1
is	1
jealous,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth;	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth,	1
and	1
is	1
furious;	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
he	1
reserveth	1
wrath	1
for	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
great	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
acquit	1
the	1
wicked:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
storm,	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
are	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
1:4	1
He	1
rebuketh	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
dry,	1
and	1
drieth	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers:	1
Bashan	1
languisheth,	1
and	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:5	1
The	1
mountains	1
quake	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
melt,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
burned	1
at	1
his	1
presence,	1
yea,	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
1:6	1
Who	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
indignation?	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger?	1
his	1
fury	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
are	1
thrown	1
down	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
good,	1
a	1
strong	1
hold	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble;	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
with	1
an	1
overrunning	1
flood	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
thereof,	1
and	1
darkness	1
shall	1
pursue	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:9	1
What	1
do	1
ye	1
imagine	1
against	1
the	1
LORD?	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end:	1
affliction	1
shall	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
while	1
they	1
be	1
folden	1
together	1
as	1
thorns,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
drunken	1
as	1
drunkards,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
as	1
stubble	1
fully	1
dry.	1
	1
1:11	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
imagineth	1
evil	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
wicked	1
counsellor.	1
	1
1:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Though	1
they	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
likewise	1
many,	1
yet	1
thus	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through.	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
afflict	1
thee	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
burst	1
thy	1
bonds	1
in	1
sunder.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
that	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
sown:	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
gods	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
grave;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
vile.	1
	1
1:15	1
Behold	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
peace!	1
O	1
Judah,	1
keep	1
thy	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
perform	1
thy	1
vows:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
pass	1
through	1
thee;	1
he	1
is	1
utterly	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
2:1	1
He	1
that	1
dasheth	1
in	1
pieces	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
keep	1
the	1
munition,	1
watch	1
the	1
way,	1
make	1
thy	1
loins	1
strong,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
power	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
turned	1
away	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
as	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
emptiers	1
have	1
emptied	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
marred	1
their	1
vine	1
branches.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
shield	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
men	1
is	1
made	1
red,	1
the	1
valiant	1
men	1
are	1
in	1
scarlet:	1
the	1
chariots	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
flaming	1
torches	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
shall	1
be	1
terribly	1
shaken.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
chariots	1
shall	1
rage	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
they	1
shall	1
justle	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
ways:	1
they	1
shall	1
seem	1
like	1
torches,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
the	1
lightnings.	1
	1
2:5	1
He	1
shall	1
recount	1
his	1
worthies:	1
they	1
shall	1
stumble	1
in	1
their	1
walk;	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
palace	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
Huzzab	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
shall	1
lead	1
her	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
doves,	1
tabering	1
upon	1
their	1
breasts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
of	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
water:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
Stand,	1
stand,	1
shall	1
they	1
cry;	1
but	1
none	1
shall	1
look	1
back.	1
	1
2:9	1
Take	1
ye	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
silver,	1
take	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
gold:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
store	1
and	1
glory	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pleasant	1
furniture.	1
	1
2:10	1
She	1
is	1
empty,	1
and	1
void,	1
and	1
waste:	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
melteth,	1
and	1
the	1
knees	1
smite	1
together,	1
and	1
much	1
pain	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
gather	1
blackness.	1
	1
2:11	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
lions,	1
and	1
the	1
feedingplace	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
where	1
the	1
lion,	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
lion,	1
walked,	1
and	1
the	1
lion's	1
whelp,	1
and	1
none	1
made	1
them	1
afraid?	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
lion	1
did	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
enough	1
for	1
his	1
whelps,	1
and	1
strangled	1
for	1
his	1
lionesses,	1
and	1
filled	1
his	1
holes	1
with	1
prey,	1
and	1
his	1
dens	1
with	1
ravin.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
burn	1
her	1
chariots	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
young	1
lions:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
prey	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
messengers	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
bloody	1
city!	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
lies	1
and	1
robbery;	1
the	1
prey	1
departeth	1
not;	1
3:2	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
whip,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
pransing	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
jumping	1
chariots.	1
	1
3:3	1
The	1
horseman	1
lifteth	1
up	1
both	1
the	1
bright	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
glittering	1
spear:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
slain,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
carcases;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
corpses;	1
they	1
stumble	1
upon	1
their	1
corpses:	1
3:4	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
whoredoms	1
of	1
the	1
wellfavoured	1
harlot,	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
witchcrafts,	1
that	1
selleth	1
nations	1
through	1
her	1
whoredoms,	1
and	1
families	1
through	1
her	1
witchcrafts.	1
	1
3:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
thy	1
skirts	1
upon	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
nations	1
thy	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
thy	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
abominable	1
filth	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
vile,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
gazingstock.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
look	1
upon	1
thee	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
laid	1
waste:	1
who	1
will	1
bemoan	1
her?	1
whence	1
shall	1
I	1
seek	1
comforters	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
3:8	1
Art	1
thou	1
better	1
than	1
populous	1
No,	1
that	1
was	1
situate	1
among	1
the	1

that	1

the	1
sea,	1

her	1
wall	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
sea?	1
	1
3:9	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
Egypt	1
were	1
her	1
strength,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
infinite;	1
Put	1
and	1
Lubim	1
were	1
thy	1
helpers.	1
	1
3:10	1
Yet	1
was	1
she	1
carried	1
away,	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
captivity:	1
her	1
young	1
children	1
also	1
were	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
her	1
honourable	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
great	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
chains.	1
	1
3:11	1
Thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
drunken:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
hid,	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
seek	1
strength	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
3:12	1
All	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
fig	1
trees	1
with	1
the	1
firstripe	1
figs:	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
shaken,	1
they	1
shall	1
even	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
eater.	1
	1
3:13	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
are	1
women:	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
wide	1
open	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
bars.	1
	1
3:14	1
Draw	1
thee	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
siege,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
go	1
into	1
clay,	1
and	1
tread	1
the	1
morter,	1
make	1
strong	1
the	1
brickkiln.	1
	1
3:15	1
There	1
shall	1
the	1
fire	1
devour	1
thee;	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
cut	1
thee	1
off,	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
thee	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
cankerworm:	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
locusts.	1
	1
3:16	1
Thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
thy	1
merchants	1
above	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven:	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
spoileth,	1
and	1
fleeth	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Thy	1
crowned	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
locusts,	1
and	1
thy	1
captains	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
grasshoppers,	1
which	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
hedges	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
day,	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
ariseth	1
they	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
their	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
known	1
where	1
they	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Thy	1
shepherds	1
slumber,	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
thy	1
nobles	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
dust:	1
thy	1
people	1
is	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gathereth	1
them.	1
	1
3:19	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
healing	1
of	1
thy	1
bruise;	1
thy	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous:	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
bruit	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
clap	1
the	1
hands	1
over	1
thee:	1
for	1
upon	1
whom	1
hath	1
not	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
passed	1
continually?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Habakkuk	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
which	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
did	1
see.	1
	1
1:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
cry,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hear!	1
even	1
cry	1
out	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
save!	1
	1
1:3	1
Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
shew	1
me	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
behold	1
grievance?	1
for	1
spoiling	1
and	1
violence	1
are	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
that	1
raise	1
up	1
strife	1
and	1
contention.	1
	1
1:4	1
Therefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
slacked,	1
and	1
judgment	1
doth	1
never	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
doth	1
compass	1
about	1
the	1
righteous;	1
therefore	1
wrong	1
judgment	1
proceedeth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Behold	1
ye	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
regard,	1
and	1
wonder	1
marvelously:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days	1
which	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
1:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
bitter	1
and	1
hasty	1
nation,	1
which	1
shall	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
dwellingplaces	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
their's.	1
	1
1:7	1
They	1
are	1
terrible	1
and	1
dreadful:	1
their	1
judgment	1
and	1
their	1
dignity	1
shall	1
proceed	1
of	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:8	1
Their	1
horses	1
also	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
leopards,	1
and	1
are	1
more	1
fierce	1
than	1
the	1
evening	1
wolves:	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
spread	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far;	1
they	1
shall	1
fly	1
as	1
the	1
eagle	1
that	1
hasteth	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
1:9	1
They	1
shall	1
come	1
all	1
for	1
violence:	1
their	1
faces	1
shall	1
sup	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
east	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
the	1
captivity	1
as	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scoff	1
at	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
scorn	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
deride	1
every	1
strong	1
hold;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
heap	1
dust,	1
and	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
his	1
mind	1
change,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
over,	1
and	1
offend,	1
imputing	1
this	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
everlasting,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
mine	1
Holy	1
One?	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
ordained	1
them	1
for	1
judgment;	1
and,	1
O	1
mighty	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
them	1
for	1
correction.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
art	1
of	1
purer	1
eyes	1
than	1
to	1
behold	1
evil,	1
and	1
canst	1
not	1
look	1
on	1
iniquity:	1
wherefore	1
lookest	1
thou	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
deal	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
holdest	1
thy	1
tongue	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
devoureth	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
he?	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
makest	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
the	1
creeping	1
things,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
ruler	1
over	1
them?	1
	1
1:15	1
They	1
take	1
up	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
angle,	1
they	1
catch	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
drag:	1
therefore	1
they	1
rejoice	1
and	1
are	1
glad.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
their	1
drag;	1
because	1
by	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
is	1
fat,	1
and	1
their	1
meat	1
plenteous.	1
	1
1:17	1
Shall	1
they	1
therefore	1
empty	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
continually	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
upon	1
my	1
watch,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
will	1
watch	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
reproved.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
Write	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
plain	1
upon	1
tables,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
run	1
that	1
readeth	1
it.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
an	1
appointed	1
time,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
shall	1
speak,	1
and	1
not	1
lie:	1
though	1
it	1
tarry,	1
wait	1
for	1
it;	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
surely	1
come,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
2:4	1
Behold,	1
his	1
soul	1
which	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
is	1
not	1
upright	1
in	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
his	1
faith.	1
	1
2:5	1
Yea	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
transgresseth	1
by	1
wine,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
proud	1
man,	1
neither	1
keepeth	1
at	1
home,	1
who	1
enlargeth	1
his	1
desire	1
as	1
hell,	1
and	1
is	1
as	1
death,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
but	1
gathereth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
heapeth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
people:	1
2:6	1
Shall	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
taunting	1
proverb	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
say,	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
increaseth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
his!	1
how	1
long?	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ladeth	1
himself	1
with	1
thick	1
clay!	1
	1
2:7	1
Shall	1
they	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
suddenly	1
that	1
shall	1
bite	1
thee,	1
and	1
awake	1
that	1
shall	1
vex	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
for	1
booties	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
2:8	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoiled	1
many	1
nations,	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
thee;	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:9	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
coveteth	1
an	1
evil	1
covetousness	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
set	1
his	1
nest	1
on	1
high,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
evil!	1
	1
2:10	1
Thou	1
hast	1
consulted	1
shame	1
to	1
thy	1
house	1
by	1
cutting	1
off	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
sinned	1
against	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
stone	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
timber	1
shall	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
2:12	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
buildeth	1
a	1
town	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
stablisheth	1
a	1
city	1
by	1
iniquity!	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
weary	1
themselves	1
for	1
very	1
vanity?	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
2:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
giveth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
drink,	1
that	1
puttest	1
thy	1
bottle	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
makest	1
him	1
drunken	1
also,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
look	1
on	1
their	1
nakedness!	1
	1
2:16	1
Thou	1
art	1
filled	1
with	1
shame	1
for	1
glory:	1
drink	1
thou	1
also,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
foreskin	1
be	1
uncovered:	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shameful	1
spewing	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
beasts,	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
afraid,	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:18	1
What	1
profiteth	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof	1
hath	1
graven	1
it;	1
the	1
molten	1
image,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
lies,	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
trusteth	1
therein,	1
to	1
make	1
dumb	1
idols?	1
	1
2:19	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
wood,	1
Awake;	1
to	1
the	1
dumb	1
stone,	1
Arise,	1
it	1
shall	1
teach!	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
laid	1
over	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
temple:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
keep	1
silence	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
A	1
prayer	1
of	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
upon	1
Shigionoth.	1
	1
3:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
speech,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
revive	1
thy	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
make	1
known;	1
in	1
wrath	1
remember	1
mercy.	1
	1
3:3	1
God	1
came	1
from	1
Teman,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
from	1
mount	1
Paran.	1
Selah.	1
His	1
glory	1
covered	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
praise.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
his	1
brightness	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
light;	1
he	1
had	1
horns	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
hiding	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:5	1
Before	1
him	1
went	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
burning	1
coals	1
went	1
forth	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
stood,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
beheld,	1
and	1
drove	1
asunder	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
the	1
everlasting	1
mountains	1
were	1
scattered,	1
the	1
perpetual	1
hills	1
did	1
bow:	1
his	1
ways	1
are	1
everlasting.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Cushan	1
in	1
affliction:	1
and	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian	1
did	1
tremble.	1
	1
3:8	1
Was	1
the	1
LORD	1
displeased	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thine	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thy	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
ride	1
upon	1
thine	1
horses	1
and	1
thy	1
chariots	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
3:9	1
Thy	1
bow	1
was	1
made	1
quite	1
naked,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
oaths	1
of	1
the	1
tribes,	1
even	1
thy	1
word.	1
Selah.	1
Thou	1
didst	1
cleave	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
rivers.	1
	1
3:10	1
The	1
mountains	1
saw	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
trembled:	1
the	1
overflowing	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
passed	1
by:	1
the	1
deep	1
uttered	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
habitation:	1
at	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thine	1
arrows	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shining	1
of	1
thy	1
glittering	1
spear.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thou	1
didst	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
indignation,	1
thou	1
didst	1
thresh	1
the	1
heathen	1
in	1
anger.	1
	1
3:13	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
forth	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
even	1
for	1
salvation	1
with	1
thine	1
anointed;	1
thou	1
woundedst	1
the	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
by	1
discovering	1
the	1
foundation	1
unto	1
the	1
neck.	1
Selah.	1
	1
3:14	1
Thou	1
didst	1
strike	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
staves	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
villages:	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
to	1
scatter	1
me:	1
their	1
rejoicing	1
was	1
as	1
to	1
devour	1
the	1
poor	1
secretly.	1
	1
3:15	1
Thou	1
didst	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
thine	1
horses,	1
through	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
great	1
waters.	1
	1
3:16	1
When	1
I	1
heard,	1
my	1
belly	1
trembled;	1
my	1
lips	1
quivered	1
at	1
the	1
voice:	1
rottenness	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
I	1
trembled	1
in	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble:	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
will	1
invade	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
troops.	1
	1
3:17	1
Although	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
shall	1
not	1
blossom,	1
neither	1
shall	1
fruit	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
vines;	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
shall	1
fail,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meat;	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
fold,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
herd	1
in	1
the	1
stalls:	1
3:18	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
3:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
feet	1
like	1
hinds'	1
feet,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
walk	1
upon	1
mine	1
high	1
places.	1
To	1
the	1
chief	1
singer	1
on	1
my	1
stringed	1
instruments.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Zephaniah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cushi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gedaliah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hizkiah,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
consume	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
stumbling	1
blocks	1
with	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Baal	1
from	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Chemarims	1
with	1
the	1
priests;	1
1:5	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops;	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
Malcham;	1
1:6	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
enquired	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prepared	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
he	1
hath	1
bid	1
his	1
guests.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
sacrifice,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
strange	1
apparel.	1
	1
1:9	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
punish	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
leap	1
on	1
the	1
threshold,	1
which	1
fill	1
their	1
masters'	1
houses	1
with	1
violence	1
and	1
deceit.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
fish	1
gate,	1
and	1
an	1
howling	1
from	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
crashing	1
from	1
the	1
hills.	1
	1
1:11	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Maktesh,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
merchant	1
people	1
are	1
cut	1
down;	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
bear	1
silver	1
are	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
candles,	1
and	1
punish	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
settled	1
on	1
their	1
lees:	1
that	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
good,	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
1:13	1
Therefore	1
their	1
goods	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
booty,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
build	1
houses,	1
but	1
not	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
not	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:14	1
The	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near,	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
and	1
hasteth	1
greatly,	1
even	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
shall	1
cry	1
there	1
bitterly.	1
	1
1:15	1
That	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wrath,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
distress,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wasteness	1
and	1
desolation,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
1:16	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
and	1
alarm	1
against	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
high	1
towers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
distress	1
upon	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
like	1
blind	1
men,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
as	1
dust,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
as	1
the	1
dung.	1
	1
1:18	1
Neither	1
their	1
silver	1
nor	1
their	1
gold	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
wrath;	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
his	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
even	1
a	1
speedy	1
riddance	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
2:1	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
yea,	1
gather	1
together,	1
O	1
nation	1
not	1
desired;	1
2:2	1
Before	1
the	1
decree	1
bring	1
forth,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
pass	1
as	1
the	1
chaff,	1
before	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
2:3	1
Seek	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
his	1
judgment;	1
seek	1
righteousness,	1
seek	1
meekness:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
Gaza	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
Ashdod	1
at	1
the	1
noon	1
day,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
2:5	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Cherethites!	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
against	1
you;	1
O	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
dwellings	1
and	1
cottages	1
for	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
folds	1
for	1
flocks.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah;	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
thereupon:	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
they	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
evening:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
visit	1
them,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
captivity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
revilings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Surely	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
as	1
Gomorrah,	1
even	1
the	1
breeding	1
of	1
nettles,	1
and	1
saltpits,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
desolation:	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
possess	1
them.	1
	1
2:10	1
This	1
shall	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
pride,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
terrible	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
famish	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
men	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
place,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:12	1
Ye	1
Ethiopians	1
also,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
my	1
sword.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
Nineveh	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
dry	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
flocks	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her,	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
both	1
the	1
cormorant	1
and	1
the	1
bittern	1
shall	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
lintels	1
of	1
it;	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
windows;	1
desolation	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
thresholds;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
uncover	1
the	1
cedar	1
work.	1
	1
2:15	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
city	1
that	1
dwelt	1
carelessly,	1
that	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me:	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
become	1
a	1
desolation,	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
beasts	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in!	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
by	1
her	1
shall	1
hiss,	1
and	1
wag	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
filthy	1
and	1
polluted,	1
to	1
the	1
oppressing	1
city!	1
3:2	1
She	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice;	1
she	1
received	1
not	1
correction;	1
she	1
trusted	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
she	1
drew	1
not	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Her	1
princes	1
within	1
her	1
are	1
roaring	1
lions;	1
her	1
judges	1
are	1
evening	1
wolves;	1
they	1
gnaw	1
not	1
the	1
bones	1
till	1
the	1
morrow.	1
	1
3:4	1
Her	1
prophets	1
are	1
light	1
and	1
treacherous	1
persons:	1
her	1
priests	1
have	1
polluted	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
The	1
just	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity:	1
every	1
morning	1
doth	1
he	1
bring	1
his	1
judgment	1
to	1
light,	1
he	1
faileth	1
not;	1
but	1
the	1
unjust	1
knoweth	1
no	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
nations:	1
their	1
towers	1
are	1
desolate;	1
I	1
made	1
their	1
streets	1
waste,	1
that	1
none	1
passeth	1
by:	1
their	1
cities	1
are	1
destroyed,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fear	1
me,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
receive	1
instruction;	1
so	1
their	1
dwelling	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
howsoever	1
I	1
punished	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
corrupted	1
all	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:8	1
Therefore	1
wait	1
ye	1
upon	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
rise	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prey:	1
for	1
my	1
determination	1
is	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
nations,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
assemble	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
pour	1
upon	1
them	1
mine	1
indignation,	1
even	1
all	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
jealousy.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
pure	1
language,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
all	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
consent.	1
	1
3:10	1
From	1
beyond	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
my	1
suppliants,	1
even	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
dispersed,	1
shall	1
bring	1
mine	1
offering.	1
	1
3:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
doings,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
pride,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
haughty	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
3:12	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
an	1
afflicted	1
and	1
poor	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity,	1
nor	1
speak	1
lies;	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
deceitful	1
tongue	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
their	1
mouth:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
and	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
3:14	1
Sing,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
out	1
thine	1
enemy:	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
evil	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:16	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not:	1
and	1
to	1
Zion,	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
slack.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
is	1
mighty;	1
he	1
will	1
save,	1
he	1
will	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
joy;	1
he	1
will	1
rest	1
in	1
his	1
love,	1
he	1
will	1
joy	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
singing.	1
	1
3:18	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sorrowful	1
for	1
the	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
thee,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burden.	1
	1
3:19	1
Behold,	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
undo	1
all	1
that	1
afflict	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
driven	1
out;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
them	1
praise	1
and	1
fame	1
in	1
every	1
land	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
3:20	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
again,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
gather	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
a	1
praise	1
among	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
when	1
I	1
turn	1
back	1
your	1
captivity	1
before	1
your	1
eyes,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1

Haggai	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king,	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
This	1
people	1
say,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
come,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
should	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
1:3	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:4	1
Is	1
it	1
time	1
for	1
you,	1
O	1
ye,	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
cieled	1
houses,	1
and	1
this	1
house	1
lie	1
waste?	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
sown	1
much,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
little;	1
ye	1
eat,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
enough;	1
ye	1
drink,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
drink;	1
ye	1
clothe	1
you,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
warm;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
earneth	1
wages	1
earneth	1
wages	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bag	1
with	1
holes.	1
	1
1:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:8	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
bring	1
wood,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Ye	1
looked	1
for	1
much,	1
and,	1
lo	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
little;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
brought	1
it	1
home,	1
I	1
did	1
blow	1
upon	1
it.	1
Why?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
Because	1
of	1
mine	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
waste,	1
and	1
ye	1
run	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
heaven	1
over	1
you	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
dew,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
drought	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
ground	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
and	1
upon	1
men,	1
and	1
upon	1
cattle,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
hands.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
spake	1
Haggai	1
the	1
LORD's	1
messenger	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
message	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
their	1
God,	1
1:15	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:1	1
In	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Haggai,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Speak	1
now	1
to	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
2:3	1
Who	1
is	1
left	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
saw	1
this	1
house	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
glory?	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
ye	1
see	1
it	1
now?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
nothing?	1
	1
2:4	1
Yet	1
now	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Joshua,	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
all	1
ye	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
work:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
2:5	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
covenanted	1
with	1
you	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
my	1
spirit	1
remaineth	1
among	1
you:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
2:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Yet	1
once,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land;	1
2:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
this	1
house	1
with	1
glory,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
silver	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
is	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
latter	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:10	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Ask	1
now	1
the	1
priests	1
concerning	1
the	1
law,	1
saying,	1
2:12	1
If	1
one	1
bear	1
holy	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
skirt	1
do	1
touch	1
bread,	1
or	1
pottage,	1
or	1
wine,	1
or	1
oil,	1
or	1
any	1
meat,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
holy?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
No.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Haggai,	1
If	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
unclean	1
by	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
touch	1
any	1
of	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
unclean?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Haggai,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
this	1
nation	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
there	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
consider	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
before	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
laid	1
upon	1
a	1
stone	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
2:16	1
Since	1
those	1
days	1
were,	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
twenty	1
measures,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
ten:	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pressfat	1
for	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
fifty	1
vessels	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
twenty.	1
	1
2:17	1
I	1
smote	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
with	1
mildew	1
and	1
with	1
hail	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
your	1
hands;	1
yet	1
ye	1
turned	1
not	1
to	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:18	1
Consider	1
now	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
temple	1
was	1
laid,	1
consider	1
it.	1
	1
2:19	1
Is	1
the	1
seed	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
barn?	1
yea,	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranate,	1
and	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
hath	1
not	1
brought	1
forth:	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
you.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Haggai	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
saying,	1
2:21	1
Speak	1
to	1
Zerubbabel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
ride	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
their	1
riders	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
2:23	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
will	1
I	1
take	1
thee,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
my	1
servant,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
signet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Zechariah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:3	1
Therefore	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:4	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
former	1
prophets	1
have	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
now	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways,	1
and	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
doings:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
Your	1
fathers,	1
where	1
are	1
they?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
do	1
they	1
live	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
said,	1
Like	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
doings,	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
dealt	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:7	1
Upon	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Sebat,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:8	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
riding	1
upon	1
a	1
red	1
horse,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
behind	1
him	1
were	1
there	1
red	1
horses,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
white.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
what	1
are	1
these?	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
these	1
be.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
sitteth	1
still,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
rest.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
against	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
indignation	1
these	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
years?	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
comfortable	1
words.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
communed	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cry	1
thou,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
jealousy.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease:	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
displeased,	1
and	1
they	1
helped	1
forward	1
the	1
affliction.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
mercies:	1
my	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
shall	1
be	1
stretched	1
forth	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:17	1
Cry	1
yet,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
My	1
cities	1
through	1
prosperity	1
shall	1
yet	1
be	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
yet	1
comfort	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
yet	1
choose	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
four	1
horns.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
be	1
these?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
me	1
four	1
carpenters.	1
	1
1:21	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
What	1
come	1
these	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
did	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
head:	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
fray	1
them,	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
horn	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
scatter	1
it.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
again,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
measuring	1
line	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
measure	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
length	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
another	1
angel	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
2:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Run,	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
as	1
towns	1
without	1
walls	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
cattle	1
therein:	1
2:5	1
For	1
I,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
her	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
fire	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
2:6	1
Ho,	1
ho,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spread	1
you	1
abroad	1
as	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:7	1
Deliver	1
thyself,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
After	1
the	1
glory	1
hath	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
spoiled	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
you	1
toucheth	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
2:9	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
their	1
servants:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
Sing	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
inherit	1
Judah	1
his	1
portion	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
choose	1
Jerusalem	1
again.	1
	1
2:13	1
Be	1
silent,	1
O	1
all	1
flesh,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
raised	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Satan	1
standing	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
resist	1
him.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
The	1
LORD	1
rebuke	1
thee,	1
O	1
Satan;	1
even	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Jerusalem	1
rebuke	1
thee:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
brand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
	1
3:3	1
Now	1
Joshua	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
filthy	1
garments,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
filthy	1
garments	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
clothe	1
thee	1
with	1
change	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
So	1
they	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
garments.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
by.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
protested	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
3:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
my	1
charge,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
judge	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
shalt	1
also	1
keep	1
my	1
courts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
places	1
to	1
walk	1
among	1
these	1
that	1
stand	1
by.	1
	1
3:8	1
Hear	1
now,	1
O	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
fellows	1
that	1
sit	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
men	1
wondered	1
at:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
servant	1
the	1
BRANCH.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
before	1
Joshua;	1
upon	1
one	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
eyes:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
engrave	1
the	1
graving	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
ye	1
call	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour	1
under	1
the	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
waked	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
wakened	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
candlestick	1
all	1
of	1
gold,	1
with	1
a	1
bowl	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
seven	1
lamps	1
thereon,	1
and	1
seven	1
pipes	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
lamps,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof:	1
4:3	1
And	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
by	1
it,	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bowl,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:6	1
Then	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
by	1
might,	1
nor	1
by	1
power,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
spirit,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
4:7	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
great	1
mountain?	1
before	1
Zerubbabel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
become	1
a	1
plain:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
headstone	1
thereof	1
with	1
shoutings,	1
crying,	1
Grace,	1
grace	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:8	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
this	1
house;	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
also	1
finish	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
small	1
things?	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
plummet	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
with	1
those	1
seven;	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
answered	1
I,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
be	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
branches	1
which	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
golden	1
pipes	1
empty	1
the	1
golden	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
themselves?	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
and	1
said,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:14	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
anointed	1
ones,	1
that	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
flying	1
roll.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
flying	1
roll;	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
is	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
ten	1
cubits.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
curse	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
stealeth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
sweareth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
5:4	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
forth,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
thief,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sweareth	1
falsely	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
timber	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
ephah	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
This	1
is	1
their	1
resemblance	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
lead:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
wickedness.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah;	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
lead	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
two	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
wings;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
wings	1
like	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
stork:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
ephah	1
between	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
Whither	1
do	1
these	1
bear	1
the	1
ephah?	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
build	1
it	1
an	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
established,	1
and	1
set	1
there	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
base.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
four	1
chariots	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
two	1
mountains;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
mountains	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
6:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
chariot	1
were	1
red	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
black	1
horses;	1
6:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
chariot	1
white	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
chariot	1
grisled	1
and	1
bay	1
horses.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
four	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
heavens,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:6	1
The	1
black	1
horses	1
which	1
are	1
therein	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
north	1
country;	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
go	1
forth	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
grisled	1
go	1
forth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
country.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
bay	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Get	1
you	1
hence,	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
So	1
they	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:8	1
Then	1
cried	1
he	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
that	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
country	1
have	1
quieted	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
country.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
6:10	1
Take	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
even	1
of	1
Heldai,	1
of	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
of	1
Jedaiah,	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
come	1
thou	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah;	1
6:11	1
Then	1
take	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
make	1
crowns,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
6:12	1
And	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
BRANCH;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:13	1
Even	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
and	1
rule	1
upon	1
his	1
throne;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
upon	1
his	1
throne:	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
between	1
them	1
both.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
crowns	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
Helem,	1
and	1
to	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
to	1
Jedaiah,	1
and	1
to	1
Hen	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
build	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
diligently	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Darius,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
in	1
Chisleu;	1
7:2	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
Sherezer	1
and	1
Regemmelech,	1
and	1
their	1
men,	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
7:3	1
And	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Should	1
I	1
weep	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
separating	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
so	1
many	1
years?	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
When	1
ye	1
fasted	1
and	1
mourned	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
and	1
seventh	1
month,	1
even	1
those	1
seventy	1
years,	1
did	1
ye	1
at	1
all	1
fast	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
drink,	1
did	1
not	1
ye	1
eat	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
drink	1
for	1
yourselves?	1
7:7	1
Should	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets,	1
when	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
inhabited	1
and	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
round	1
about	1
her,	1
when	1
men	1
inhabited	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
the	1
plain?	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
saying,	1
7:9	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Execute	1
true	1
judgment,	1
and	1
shew	1
mercy	1
and	1
compassions	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
brother:	1
7:10	1
And	1
oppress	1
not	1
the	1
widow,	1
nor	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
the	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
against	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
7:11	1
But	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
hearken,	1
and	1
pulled	1
away	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
7:12	1
Yea,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
hearts	1
as	1
an	1
adamant	1
stone,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets:	1
therefore	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
wrath	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
so	1
they	1
cried,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
7:14	1
But	1
I	1
scattered	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not.	1
Thus	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
desolate	1
after	1
them,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
passed	1
through	1
nor	1
returned:	1
for	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land	1
desolate.	1
	1
8:1	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
great	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
fury.	1
	1
8:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
and	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
8:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
There	1
shall	1
yet	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
old	1
women	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
very	1
age.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
playing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
thereof.	1
	1
8:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
these	1
days,	1
should	1
it	1
also	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
country;	1
8:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong,	1
ye	1
that	1
hear	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
these	1
words	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
laid,	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
might	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hire	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
any	1
hire	1
for	1
beast;	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
or	1
came	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
affliction:	1
for	1
I	1
set	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
the	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
prosperous;	1
the	1
vine	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
the	1
ground	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
dew;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
possess	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
a	1
curse	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
blessing:	1
fear	1
not,	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
As	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
punish	1
you,	1
when	1
your	1
fathers	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
wrath,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
repented	1
not:	1
8:15	1
So	1
again	1
have	1
I	1
thought	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
8:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do;	1
Speak	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
execute	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
gates:	1
8:17	1
And	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
love	1
no	1
false	1
oath:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
hate,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:19	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
The	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fifth,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
seventh,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
tenth,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
cheerful	1
feasts;	1
therefore	1
love	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:20	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
It	1
shall	1
yet	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
many	1
cities:	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
one	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
another,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
speedily	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
also.	1
	1
8:22	1
Yea,	1
many	1
people	1
and	1
strong	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
ten	1
men	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
languages	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
even	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hadrach,	1
and	1
Damascus	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
rest	1
thereof:	1
when	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
as	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
toward	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
Hamath	1
also	1
shall	1
border	1
thereby;	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
very	1
wise.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
Tyrus	1
did	1
build	1
herself	1
a	1
strong	1
hold,	1
and	1
heaped	1
up	1
silver	1
as	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
fine	1
gold	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
9:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
her	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
9:5	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
fear;	1
Gaza	1
also	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
Ekron;	1
for	1
her	1
expectation	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
inhabited.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
a	1
bastard	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
abominations	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
teeth:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth,	1
even	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
governor	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
as	1
a	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
encamp	1
about	1
mine	1
house	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
passeth	1
by,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
returneth:	1
and	1
no	1
oppressor	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
with	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:9	1
Rejoice	1
greatly,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee:	1
he	1
is	1
just,	1
and	1
having	1
salvation;	1
lowly,	1
and	1
riding	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
upon	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
chariot	1
from	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
peace	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen:	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
from	1
sea	1
even	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
thee	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
forth	1
thy	1
prisoners	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
9:12	1
Turn	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
strong	1
hold,	1
ye	1
prisoners	1
of	1
hope:	1
even	1
to	1
day	1
do	1
I	1
declare	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
double	1
unto	1
thee;	1
9:13	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
bent	1
Judah	1
for	1
me,	1
filled	1
the	1
bow	1
with	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
raised	1
up	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
against	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Greece,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
arrow	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
lightning:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
shall	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
defend	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour,	1
and	1
subdue	1
with	1
sling	1
stones;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
through	1
wine;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
like	1
bowls,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
save	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
a	1
crown,	1
lifted	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
ensign	1
upon	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
beauty!	1
corn	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
the	1
maids.	1
	1
10:1	1
Ask	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
rain;	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
bright	1
clouds,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
showers	1
of	1
rain,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
the	1
idols	1
have	1
spoken	1
vanity,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
have	1
told	1
false	1
dreams;	1
they	1
comfort	1
in	1
vain:	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way	1
as	1
a	1
flock,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:3	1
Mine	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
I	1
punished	1
the	1
goats:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
flock	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
as	1
his	1
goodly	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
10:4	1
Out	1
of	1
him	1
came	1
forth	1
the	1
corner,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
nail,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
battle	1
bow,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
every	1
oppressor	1
together.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
mighty	1
men,	1
which	1
tread	1
down	1
their	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
the	1
battle:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
riders	1
on	1
horses	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
place	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
off:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
as	1
through	1
wine:	1
yea,	1
their	1
children	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
glad;	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:8	1
I	1
will	1
hiss	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
gather	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
increase	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
increased.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
far	1
countries;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
turn	1
again.	1
	1
10:10	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
place	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
affliction,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
deeps	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
dry	1
up:	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Assyria	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
depart	1
away.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:1	1
Open	1
thy	1
doors,	1
O	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
may	1
devour	1
thy	1
cedars.	1
	1
11:2	1
Howl,	1
fir	1
tree;	1
for	1
the	1
cedar	1
is	1
fallen;	1
because	1
the	1
mighty	1
are	1
spoiled:	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
oaks	1
of	1
Bashan;	1
for	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
vintage	1
is	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
11:3	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds;	1
for	1
their	1
glory	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
young	1
lions;	1
for	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Jordan	1
is	1
spoiled.	1
	1
11:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God;	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
11:5	1
Whose	1
possessors	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
hold	1
themselves	1
not	1
guilty:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sell	1
them	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
rich:	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
shepherds	1
pity	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
pity	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
hand,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
king:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
slaughter,	1
even	1
you,	1
O	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
staves;	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
called	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
called	1
Bands;	1
and	1
I	1
fed	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
11:8	1
Three	1
shepherds	1
also	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
month;	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
lothed	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
also	1
abhorred	1
me.	1
	1
11:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
feed	1
you:	1
that	1
that	1
dieth,	1
let	1
it	1
die;	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
rest	1
eat	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
staff,	1
even	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
asunder,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
that	1
waited	1
upon	1
me	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
think	1
good,	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
price;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
forbear.	1
So	1
they	1
weighed	1
for	1
my	1
price	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
potter:	1
a	1
goodly	1
price	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
prised	1
at	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
potter	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
I	1
cut	1
asunder	1
mine	1
other	1
staff,	1
even	1
Bands,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
between	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
unto	1
thee	1
yet	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
a	1
foolish	1
shepherd.	1
	1
11:16	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
shepherd	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
visit	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
neither	1
shall	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
one,	1
nor	1
heal	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
broken,	1
nor	1
feed	1
that	1
that	1
standeth	1
still:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
tear	1
their	1
claws	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
11:17	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
idol	1
shepherd	1
that	1
leaveth	1
the	1
flock!	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
eye:	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
clean	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
darkened.	1
	1
12:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
stretcheth	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
layeth	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
formeth	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
12:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
both	1
against	1
Judah	1
and	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
burdensome	1
stone	1
for	1
all	1
people:	1
all	1
that	1
burden	1
themselves	1
with	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
12:4	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
with	1
madness:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
blindness.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
12:6	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
like	1
an	1
hearth	1
of	1
fire	1
among	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
torch	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
sheaf;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
place,	1
even	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Judah	1
first,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
do	1
not	1
magnify	1
themselves	1
against	1
Judah.	1
	1
12:8	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
defend	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
feeble	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
God,	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
supplications:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
pierced,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
mourn	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
mourneth	1
for	1
his	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
his	1
firstborn.	1
	1
12:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
mourning	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Hadadrimmon	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Megiddon.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
every	1
family	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nathan	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:13	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Shimei	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:14	1
All	1
the	1
families	1
that	1
remain,	1
every	1
family	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart.	1
	1
13:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fountain	1
opened	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
sin	1
and	1
for	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
idols	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered:	1
and	1
also	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
shall	1
yet	1
prophesy,	1
then	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
live;	1
for	1
thou	1
speakest	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
thrust	1
him	1
through	1
when	1
he	1
prophesieth.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vision,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
prophesied;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
wear	1
a	1
rough	1
garment	1
to	1
deceive:	1
13:5	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
prophet,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
husbandman;	1
for	1
man	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
cattle	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
one	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
wounds	1
in	1
thine	1
hands?	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Those	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
friends.	1
	1
13:7	1
Awake,	1
O	1
sword,	1
against	1
my	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
fellow,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
two	1
parts	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
die;	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
therein.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
will	1
refine	1
them	1
as	1
silver	1
is	1
refined,	1
and	1
will	1
try	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
is	1
tried:	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
them:	1
I	1
will	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
14:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
and	1
thy	1
spoil	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
nations	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
battle;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
rifled,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
ravished;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
14:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
those	1
nations,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
shall	1
cleave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
valley;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
shall	1
remove	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
toward	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
for	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
Azal:	1
yea,	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee,	1
like	1
as	1
ye	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
clear,	1
nor	1
dark:	1
14:7	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
not	1
day,	1
nor	1
night:	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
evening	1
time	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
light.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
living	1
waters	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
former	1
sea,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
hinder	1
sea:	1
in	1
summer	1
and	1
in	1
winter	1
shall	1
it	1
be.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
one	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
one.	1
	1
14:10	1
All	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
as	1
a	1
plain	1
from	1
Geba	1
to	1
Rimmon	1
south	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
inhabited	1
in	1
her	1
place,	1
from	1
Benjamin's	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
gate,	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
winepresses.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
men	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
utter	1
destruction;	1
but	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
safely	1
inhabited.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem;	1
Their	1
flesh	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
while	1
they	1
stand	1
upon	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
holes,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
tumult	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hold	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fight	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
apparel,	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
so	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
horse,	1
of	1
the	1
mule,	1
of	1
the	1
camel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
these	1
tents,	1
as	1
this	1
plague.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
came	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
even	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whoso	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
even	1
upon	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
rain.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Egypt	1
go	1
not	1
up,	1
and	1
come	1
not,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
rain;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:19	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:20	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
HOLINESS	1
UNTO	1
THE	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
pots	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
bowls	1
before	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
14:21	1
Yea,	1
every	1
pot	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
in	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
seethe	1
therein:	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Malachi	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Israel	1
by	1
Malachi.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
hast	1
thou	1
loved	1
us?	1
Was	1
not	1
Esau	1
Jacob's	1
brother?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
yet	1
I	1
loved	1
Jacob,	1
1:3	1
And	1
I	1
hated	1
Esau,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
mountains	1
and	1
his	1
heritage	1
waste	1
for	1
the	1
dragons	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:4	1
Whereas	1
Edom	1
saith,	1
We	1
are	1
impoverished,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
desolate	1
places;	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
They	1
shall	1
build,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
throw	1
down;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
them,	1
The	1
border	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
and,	1
The	1
people	1
against	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
indignation	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
your	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
magnified	1
from	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:6	1
A	1
son	1
honoureth	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
his	1
master:	1
if	1
then	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
father,	1
where	1
is	1
mine	1
honour?	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
master,	1
where	1
is	1
my	1
fear?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
you,	1
O	1
priests,	1
that	1
despise	1
my	1
name.	1
And	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
despised	1
thy	1
name?	1
	1
1:7	1
Ye	1
offer	1
polluted	1
bread	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
polluted	1
thee?	1
In	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
blind	1
for	1
sacrifice,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
lame	1
and	1
sick,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
offer	1
it	1
now	1
unto	1
thy	1
governor;	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thee,	1
or	1
accept	1
thy	1
person?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
beseech	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
us:	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
by	1
your	1
means:	1
will	1
he	1
regard	1
your	1
persons?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:10	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
even	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
would	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
for	1
nought?	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
kindle	1
fire	1
on	1
mine	1
altar	1
for	1
nought.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
accept	1
an	1
offering	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
incense	1
shall	1
be	1
offered	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
a	1
pure	1
offering:	1
for	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
profaned	1
it,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
polluted;	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
even	1
his	1
meat,	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:13	1
Ye	1
said	1
also,	1
Behold,	1
what	1
a	1
weariness	1
is	1
it!	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
snuffed	1
at	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
ye	1
brought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn,	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
and	1
the	1
sick;	1
thus	1
ye	1
brought	1
an	1
offering:	1
should	1
I	1
accept	1
this	1
of	1
your	1
hand?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
But	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
deceiver,	1
which	1
hath	1
in	1
his	1
flock	1
a	1
male,	1
and	1
voweth,	1
and	1
sacrificeth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
corrupt	1
thing:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
great	1
King,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
dreadful	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
ye	1
priests,	1
this	1
commandment	1
is	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
2:2	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart,	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
send	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
curse	1
your	1
blessings:	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
cursed	1
them	1
already,	1
because	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
2:3	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
corrupt	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
spread	1
dung	1
upon	1
your	1
faces,	1
even	1
the	1
dung	1
of	1
your	1
solemn	1
feasts;	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
this	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
covenant	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:5	1
My	1
covenant	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
peace;	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
wherewith	1
he	1
feared	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
before	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
truth	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
iniquity	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
lips:	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
equity,	1
and	1
did	1
turn	1
many	1
away	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
priest's	1
lips	1
should	1
keep	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
law	1
at	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
ye	1
have	1
caused	1
many	1
to	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
have	1
corrupted	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
made	1
you	1
contemptible	1
and	1
base	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
ways,	1
but	1
have	1
been	1
partial	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:10	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
all	1
one	1
father?	1
hath	1
not	1
one	1
God	1
created	1
us?	1
why	1
do	1
we	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
every	1
man	1
against	1
his	1
brother,	1
by	1
profaning	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
our	1
fathers?	1
	1
2:11	1
Judah	1
hath	1
dealt	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
an	1
abomination	1
is	1
committed	1
in	1
Israel	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
Judah	1
hath	1
profaned	1
the	1
holiness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
loved,	1
and	1
hath	1
married	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
god.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this,	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
scholar,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
this	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
again,	1
covering	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
tears,	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
crying	1
out,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
offering	1
any	1
more,	1
or	1
receiveth	1
it	1
with	1
good	1
will	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
2:14	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
witness	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
against	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
treacherously:	1
yet	1
is	1
she	1
thy	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
make	1
one?	1
Yet	1
had	1
he	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
spirit.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
one?	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
seek	1
a	1
godly	1
seed.	1
Therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
that	1
he	1
hateth	1
putting	1
away:	1
for	1
one	1
covereth	1
violence	1
with	1
his	1
garment,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
deal	1
not	1
treacherously.	1
	1
2:17	1
Ye	1
have	1
wearied	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
your	1
words.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
wearied	1
him?	1
When	1
ye	1
say,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
them;	1
or,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
temple,	1
even	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
whom	1
ye	1
delight	1
in:	1
behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:2	1
But	1
who	1
may	1
abide	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
stand	1
when	1
he	1
appeareth?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
refiner's	1
fire,	1
and	1
like	1
fullers'	1
soap:	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
refiner	1
and	1
purifier	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
purge	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
pleasant	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
years.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
swift	1
witness	1
against	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
adulterers,	1
and	1
against	1
false	1
swearers,	1
and	1
against	1
those	1
that	1
oppress	1
the	1
hireling	1
in	1
his	1
wages,	1
the	1
widow,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
that	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
stranger	1
from	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
change	1
not;	1
therefore	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
are	1
not	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:7	1
Even	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
them.	1
Return	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
But	1
ye	1
said,	1
Wherein	1
shall	1

return?	1
	1
3:8	1
Will	1
a	1
man	1
rob	1
God?	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me.	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
robbed	1
thee?	1
In	1
tithes	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
3:9	1
Ye	1
are	1
cursed	1
with	1
a	1
curse:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me,	1
even	1
this	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
3:10	1
Bring	1
ye	1
all	1
the	1
tithes	1
into	1
the	1
storehouse,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
meat	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
prove	1
me	1
now	1
herewith,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
if	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
you	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
pour	1
you	1
out	1
a	1
blessing,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
room	1
enough	1
to	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
rebuke	1
the	1
devourer	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
ground;	1
neither	1
shall	1
your	1
vine	1
cast	1
her	1
fruit	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
blessed:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
delightsome	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:13	1
Your	1
words	1
have	1
been	1
stout	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
spoken	1
so	1
much	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
3:14	1
Ye	1
have	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
serve	1
God:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
kept	1
his	1
ordinance,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
walked	1
mournfully	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
proud	1
happy;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
work	1
wickedness	1
are	1
set	1
up;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
tempt	1
God	1
are	1
even	1
delivered.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
often	1
one	1
to	1
another:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
remembrance	1
was	1
written	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
upon	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
jewels;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
spareth	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
that	1
serveth	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
return,	1
and	1
discern	1
between	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked,	1
between	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
God	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
day	1
cometh,	1
that	1
shall	1
burn	1
as	1
an	1
oven;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proud,	1
yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
shall	1
be	1
stubble:	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
up,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
neither	1
root	1
nor	1
branch.	1
	1
4:2	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
fear	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Sun	1
of	1
righteousness	1
arise	1
with	1
healing	1
in	1
his	1

and	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
grow	1
up	1
as	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
stall.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
wicked;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashes	1
under	1
the	1

in	1

Remember	1

are	1
fourteen	1
generations;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
carrying	1
away	1
into	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Christ	1
are	1
fourteen	1
generations.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
wise:	1
When	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
Mary	1
was	1
espoused	1
to	1
Joseph,	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
together,	1
she	1
was	1
found	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:19	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
her	1
husband,	1
being	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
publick	1
example,	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away	1
privily.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
while	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
these	1
things,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Joseph,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
fear	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
Mary	1
thy	1
wife:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
conceived	1
in	1
her	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:22	1
Now	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:23	1
Behold,	1
a	1
virgin	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Emmanuel,	1
which	1
being	1
interpreted	1
is,	1
God	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:24	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
sleep	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
bidden	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
wife:	1
1:25	1
And	1
knew	1
her	1
not	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod	1
the	1
king,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
wise	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
2:2	1
Saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
2:3	1
When	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
he	1
demanded	1
of	1
them	1
where	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
born.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
In	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
2:6	1
And	1
thou	1
Bethlehem,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Juda,	1
art	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Juda:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
come	1
a	1
Governor,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:7	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
privily	1
called	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
enquired	1
of	1
them	1
diligently	1
what	1
time	1
the	1
star	1
appeared.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
search	1
diligently	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
child;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
also.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
king,	1
they	1
departed;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
star,	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
where	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
was.	1
	1
2:10	1
When	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
star,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
exceeding	1
great	1
joy.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
their	1
treasures,	1
they	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
gifts;	1
gold,	1
and	1
frankincense	1
and	1
myrrh.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
Herod,	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
country	1
another	1
way.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
flee	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
there	1
until	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
word:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
to	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
2:14	1
When	1
he	1
arose,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
2:15	1
And	1
was	1
there	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Herod:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mocked	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
was	1
exceeding	1
wroth,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof,	1
from	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
under,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
diligently	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:18	1
In	1
Rama	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
heard,	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
weeping,	1
and	1
great	1
mourning,	1
Rachel	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
comforted,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
was	1
dead,	1
behold,	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
2:20	1
Saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
dead	1
which	1
sought	1
the	1
young	1
child's	1
life.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Archelaus	1
did	1
reign	1
in	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Herod,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
thither:	1
notwithstanding,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Galilee:	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nazareth:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
Nazarene.	1
	1
3:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
came	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist,	1
preaching	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
3:2	1
And	1
saying,	1
Repent	1
ye:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
John	1
had	1
his	1
raiment	1
of	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
a	1
leathern	1
girdle	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
his	1
meat	1
was	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey.	1
	1
3:5	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
3:6	1
And	1
were	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
Sadducees	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
baptism,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance:	1
3:9	1
And	1
think	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
therefore	1
every	1
tree	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:11	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water	1
unto	1
repentance.	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
I,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
bear:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:12	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
gather	1
his	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
garner;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
up	1
the	1
chaff	1
with	1
unquenchable	1
fire.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
John,	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
John	1
forbad	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
comest	1
thou	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Suffer	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
now:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
becometh	1
us	1
to	1
fulfil	1
all	1
righteousness.	1
Then	1
he	1
suffered	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
went	1
up	1
straightway	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
opened	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
descending	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
lighting	1
upon	1
him:	1
3:17	1
And	1
lo	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
was	1
Jesus	1
led	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
fasted	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
he	1
was	1
afterward	1
an	1
hungred.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
tempter	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
that	1
these	1
stones	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
Man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
setteth	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
4:6	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
concerning	1
thee:	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:7	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
again,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
Again,	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
exceeding	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them;	1
4:9	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
me.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
leaveth	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
angels	1
came	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
4:13	1
And	1
leaving	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Zabulon	1
and	1
Nephthalim:	1
4:14	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
4:15	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Zabulon,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephthalim,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
Galilee	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
4:16	1
The	1
people	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
darkness	1
saw	1
great	1
light;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
region	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
light	1
is	1
sprung	1
up.	1
	1
4:17	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
preach,	1
and	1
to	1
say,	1
Repent:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
walking	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
saw	1
two	1
brethren,	1
Simon	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Follow	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
they	1
straightway	1
left	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
going	1
on	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
two	1
brethren,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
Zebedee	1
their	1
father,	1
mending	1
their	1
nets;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
they	1
immediately	1
left	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
his	1
fame	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
Syria:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
sick	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
and	1
torments,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
palsy;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
great	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
from	1
Decapolis,	1
and	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
seeing	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
set,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him:	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
taught	1
them,	1
saying,	1
5:3	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
spirit:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:4	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
mourn:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
5:5	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
meek:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:6	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
after	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
5:7	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
merciful:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
pure	1
in	1
heart:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
God.	1
	1
5:9	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
peacemakers:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:10	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
persecuted	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:11	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
revile	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil	1
against	1
you	1
falsely,	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
	1
5:12	1
Rejoice,	1
and	1
be	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
so	1
persecuted	1
they	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
salt	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
salted?	1
it	1
is	1
thenceforth	1
good	1
for	1
nothing,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
A	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
an	1
hill	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
5:15	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick;	1
and	1
it	1
giveth	1
light	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:16	1
Let	1
your	1
light	1
so	1
shine	1
before	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
and	1
glorify	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:17	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
the	1
prophets:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy,	1
but	1
to	1
fulfil.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Till	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
pass,	1
one	1
jot	1
or	1
one	1
tittle	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
5:19	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
break	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
least	1
commandments,	1
and	1
shall	1
teach	1
men	1
so,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
and	1
teach	1
them,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
except	1
your	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
exceed	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:21	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
kill	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
5:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Raca,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
council:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
5:23	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
thy	1
gift	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
there	1
rememberest	1
that	1
thy	1
brother	1
hath	1
ought	1
against	1
thee;	1
5:24	1
Leave	1
there	1
thy	1
gift	1
before	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
first	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
and	1
offer	1
thy	1
gift.	1
	1
5:25	1
Agree	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
quickly,	1
whiles	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
him;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
the	1
adversary	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
5:26	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
come	1
out	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
uttermost	1
farthing.	1
	1
5:27	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
5:28	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
looketh	1
on	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
lust	1
after	1
her	1
hath	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
already	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:31	1
It	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement:	1
5:32	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
saving	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
fornication,	1
causeth	1
her	1
to	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
5:33	1
Again,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forswear	1
thyself,	1
but	1
shalt	1
perform	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
thine	1
oaths:	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Swear	1
not	1
at	1
all;	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
God's	1
throne:	1
5:35	1
Nor	1
by	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
footstool:	1
neither	1
by	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
King.	1
	1
5:36	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
swear	1
by	1
thy	1
head,	1
because	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
make	1
one	1
hair	1
white	1
or	1
black.	1
	1
5:37	1
But	1
let	1
your	1
communication	1
be,	1
Yea,	1
yea;	1
Nay,	1
nay:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
these	1
cometh	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:38	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
An	1
eye	1
for	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
a	1
tooth	1
for	1
a	1
tooth:	1
5:39	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
resist	1
not	1
evil:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
cheek,	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
also.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
sue	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
coat,	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1
cloak	1
also.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
compel	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
mile,	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
twain.	1
	1
5:42	1
Give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
asketh	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
borrow	1
of	1
thee	1
turn	1
not	1
thou	1
away.	1
	1
5:43	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
hate	1
thine	1
enemy.	1
	1
5:44	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you;	1
5:45	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
he	1
maketh	1
his	1
sun	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
unjust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
reward	1
have	1
ye?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
the	1
same?	1
	1
5:47	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
salute	1
your	1
brethren	1
only,	1
what	1
do	1
ye	1
more	1
than	1
others?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
so?	1
	1
5:48	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
perfect,	1
even	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
is	1
perfect.	1
	1
6:1	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
your	1
alms	1
before	1
men,	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
them:	1
otherwise	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:2	1
Therefore	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
thine	1
alms,	1
do	1
not	1
sound	1
a	1
trumpet	1
before	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
glory	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:3	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
alms,	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
left	1
hand	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
doeth:	1
6:4	1
That	1
thine	1
alms	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
himself	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
are:	1
for	1
they	1
love	1
to	1
pray	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
enter	1
into	1
thy	1
closet,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
shut	1
thy	1
door,	1
pray	1
to	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret;	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
use	1
not	1
vain	1
repetitions,	1
as	1
the	1
heathen	1
do:	1
for	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
for	1
their	1
much	1
speaking.	1
	1
6:8	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
like	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of,	1
before	1
ye	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
6:9	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
therefore	1
pray	1
ye:	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
6:10	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come,	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
earth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:11	1
Give	1
us	1
this	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
debts,	1
as	1
we	1
forgive	1
our	1
debtors.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation,	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil:	1
For	1
thine	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
the	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
will	1
also	1
forgive	1
you:	1
6:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
not	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
6:16	1
Moreover	1
when	1
ye	1
fast,	1
be	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites,	1
of	1
a	1
sad	1
countenance:	1
for	1
they	1
disfigure	1
their	1
faces,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
appear	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
fastest,	1
anoint	1
thine	1
head,	1
and	1
wash	1
thy	1
face;	1
6:18	1
That	1
thou	1
appear	1
not	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast,	1
but	1
unto	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father,	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret,	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:19	1
Lay	1
not	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
upon	1
earth,	1
where	1
moth	1
and	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
steal:	1
6:20	1
But	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
in	1
heaven,	1
where	1
neither	1
moth	1
nor	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
do	1
not	1
break	1
through	1
nor	1
steal:	1
6:21	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
if	1
therefore	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
6:23	1
But	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
evil,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
darkness,	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
that	1
darkness!	1
	1
6:24	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
6:25	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink;	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
life	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
than	1
raiment?	1
	1
6:26	1
Behold	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air:	1
for	1
they	1
sow	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap,	1
nor	1
gather	1
into	1
barns;	1
yet	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them.	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
	1
6:27	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
one	1
cubit	1
unto	1
his	1
stature?	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
raiment?	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
how	1
they	1
grow;	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
spin:	1
6:29	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
even	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
6:30	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
which	1
to	1
day	1
is,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
6:31	1
Therefore	1
take	1
no	1
thought,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat?	1
or,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink?	1
or,	1
Wherewithal	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
clothed?	1
	1
6:32	1
(For	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
seek:)	1
for	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
6:33	1
But	1
seek	1
ye	1
first	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:34	1
Take	1
therefore	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
morrow:	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
shall	1
take	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
itself.	1
Sufficient	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
evil	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:1	1
Judge	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
judged.	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
with	1
what	1
judgment	1
ye	1
judge,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
judged:	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
considerest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:4	1
Or	1
how	1
wilt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
eye;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
beam	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:5	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
first	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye;	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
7:6	1
Give	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs,	1
neither	1
cast	1
ye	1
your	1
pearls	1
before	1
swine,	1
lest	1
they	1
trample	1
them	1
under	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
and	1
rend	1
you.	1
	1
7:7	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you:	1
7:8	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:9	1
Or	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
you,	1
whom	1
if	1
his	1
son	1
ask	1
bread,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
	1
7:10	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
give	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
7:12	1
Therefore	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
even	1
so	1
to	1
them:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
7:13	1
Enter	1
ye	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
wide	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
broad	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
leadeth	1
to	1
destruction,	1
and	1
many	1
there	1
be	1
which	1
go	1
in	1
thereat:	1
7:14	1
Because	1
strait	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
narrow	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
which	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
life,	1
and	1
few	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
7:15	1
Beware	1
of	1
false	1
prophets,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
sheep's	1
clothing,	1
but	1
inwardly	1
they	1
are	1
ravening	1
wolves.	1
	1
7:16	1
Ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
fruits.	1
Do	1
men	1
gather	1
grapes	1
of	1
thorns,	1
or	1
figs	1
of	1
thistles?	1
	1
7:17	1
Even	1
so	1
every	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit;	1
but	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:18	1
A	1
good	1
tree	1
cannot	1
bring	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit,	1
neither	1
can	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:19	1
Every	1
tree	1
that	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
7:20	1
Wherefore	1
by	1
their	1
fruits	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
7:21	1
Not	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
7:22	1
Many	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
prophesied	1
in	1
thy	1
name?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
have	1
cast	1
out	1
devils?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
done	1
many	1
wonderful	1
works?	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
profess	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
you:	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:24	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1
him	1
unto	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
a	1
rock:	1
7:25	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
not:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them	1
not,	1
shall	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
foolish	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
sand:	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
ended	1
these	1
sayings,	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
7:29	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
having	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
8:1	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
leprosy	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man;	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum,	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
centurion,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
8:6	1
And	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
my	1
servant	1
lieth	1
at	1
home	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
grievously	1
tormented.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
him.	1
	1
8:8	1
The	1
centurion	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
come	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
only,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
soldiers	1
under	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
man,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
followed,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed,	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
his	1
servant	1
was	1
healed	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
hour.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Peter's	1
house,	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
wife's	1
mother	1
laid,	1
and	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:16	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils:	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
spirits	1
with	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
healed	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
sick:	1
8:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Himself	1
took	1
our	1
infirmities,	1
and	1
bare	1
our	1
sicknesses.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
great	1
multitudes	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
depart	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
scribe	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
another	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
8:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
his	1
disciples	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:24	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
waves:	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
us:	1
we	1
perish.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
fearful,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
8:27	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him!	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gergesenes,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
two	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs,	1
exceeding	1
fierce,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
pass	1
by	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
8:29	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
torment	1
us	1
before	1
the	1
time?	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off	1
from	1
them	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
8:31	1
So	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
cast	1
us	1
out,	1
suffer	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out,	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
kept	1
them	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
told	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
befallen	1
to	1
the	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
8:34	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
9:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
bed:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
seeing	1
their	1
faith	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy;	1
Son,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
9:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
said	1
within	1
themselves,	1
This	1
man	1
blasphemeth.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
think	1
ye	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
Arise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
unto	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
9:8	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
multitudes	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
such	1
power	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
forth	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man,	1
named	1
Matthew,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
behold,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
came	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Why	1
eateth	1
your	1
Master	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
9:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
be	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
go	1
ye	1
and	1
learn	1
what	1
that	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
9:14	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast	1
oft,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
mourn,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
but	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast.	1
	1
9:16	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
unto	1
an	1
old	1
garment,	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
in	1
to	1
fill	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
from	1
the	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
9:17	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
bottles	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
runneth	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
perish:	1
but	1
they	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
new	1
bottles,	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
9:18	1
While	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
My	1
daughter	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
dead:	1
but	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hand	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
diseased	1
with	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
9:21	1
For	1
she	1
said	1
within	1
herself,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
but	1
touch	1
his	1
garment,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
said,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
hour.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
ruler's	1
house,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
minstrels	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
making	1
a	1
noise,	1
9:24	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
place:	1
for	1
the	1
maid	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
	1
9:25	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
put	1
forth,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
arose.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
hereof	1
went	1
abroad	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
land.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
thence,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
followed	1
him,	1
crying,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
blind	1
men	1
came	1
to	1
him:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Believe	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
this?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:29	1
Then	1
touched	1
he	1
their	1
eyes,	1
saying,	1
According	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
See	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
spread	1
abroad	1
his	1
fame	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
country.	1
	1
9:32	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
dumb	1
man	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake:	1
and	1
the	1
multitudes	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
seen	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
sickness	1
and	1
every	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:36	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
fainted,	1
and	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
as	1
sheep	1
having	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
9:37	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
plenteous,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few;	1
9:38	1
Pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
against	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease.	1
	1
10:2	1
Now	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
are	1
these;	1
The	1
first,	1
Simon,	1
who	1
is	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother;	1
10:3	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew;	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
Matthew	1
the	1
publican;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Lebbaeus,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Thaddaeus;	1
10:4	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
who	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him.	1
	1
10:5	1
These	1
twelve	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
into	1
any	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
enter	1
ye	1
not:	1
10:6	1
But	1
go	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
go,	1
preach,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
10:8	1
Heal	1
the	1
sick,	1
cleanse	1
the	1
lepers,	1
raise	1
the	1
dead,	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
freely	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
freely	1
give.	1
	1
10:9	1
Provide	1
neither	1
gold,	1
nor	1
silver,	1
nor	1
brass	1
in	1
your	1
purses,	1
10:10	1
Nor	1
scrip	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
two	1
coats,	1
neither	1
shoes,	1
nor	1
yet	1
staves:	1
for	1
the	1
workman	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
meat.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
or	1
town	1
ye	1
shall	1
enter,	1
enquire	1
who	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
worthy;	1
and	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
go	1
thence.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
salute	1
it.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
house	1
be	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
come	1
upon	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
return	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
your	1
words,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
or	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
feet.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
sheep	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
wolves:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
wise	1
as	1
serpents,	1
and	1
harmless	1
as	1
doves.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
beware	1
of	1
men:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
councils,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
scourge	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues;	1
10:18	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
governors	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak.	1
	1
10:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
speaketh	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
child:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:23	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
persecute	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
flee	1
ye	1
into	1
another:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
come.	1
	1
10:24	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master,	1
nor	1
the	1
servant	1
above	1
his	1
lord.	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
disciple	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
as	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
called	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Beelzebub,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
household?	1
	1
10:26	1
Fear	1
them	1
not	1
therefore:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
and	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
10:27	1
What	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye	1
in	1
light:	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
the	1
ear,	1
that	1
preach	1
ye	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
fear	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
but	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
soul:	1
but	1
rather	1
fear	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
in	1
hell.	1
	1
10:29	1
Are	1
not	1
two	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
farthing?	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
your	1
Father.	1
	1
10:30	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
	1
10:31	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore,	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
10:32	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
confess	1
also	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
deny	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
deny	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:34	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
peace	1
on	1
earth:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
peace,	1
but	1
a	1
sword.	1
	1
10:35	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
variance	1
against	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
foes	1
shall	1
be	1
they	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
household.	1
	1
10:37	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
father	1
or	1
mother	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
son	1
or	1
daughter	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:38	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
not	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:39	1
He	1
that	1
findeth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loseth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
10:40	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
you	1
receiveth	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
prophet	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
prophet	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
prophet's	1
reward;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
righteous	1
man's	1
reward.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
to	1
drink	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
disciple,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
commanding	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
preach	1
in	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
when	1
John	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come,	1
or	1
do	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
11:4	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
and	1
shew	1
John	1
again	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
hear	1
and	1
see:	1
11:5	1
The	1
blind	1
receive	1
their	1
sight,	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
have	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed,	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
multitudes	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
behold,	1
they	1
that	1
wear	1
soft	1
clothing	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
houses.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
11:11	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
risen	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
notwithstanding	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
until	1
now	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
suffereth	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
violent	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
prophesied	1
until	1
John.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
receive	1
it,	1
this	1
is	1
Elias,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:15	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
this	1
generation?	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
their	1
fellows,	1
11:17	1
And	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
lamented.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
nor	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
11:19	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
man	1
gluttonous,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners.	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
upbraid	1
the	1
cities	1
wherein	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
works	1
were	1
done,	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
not:	1
11:21	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
repented	1
long	1
ago	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
hell:	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
thee,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Sodom,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:24	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:25	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes.	1
	1
11:26	1
Even	1
so,	1
Father:	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
11:27	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
any	1
man	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
11:28	1
Come	1
unto	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
labour	1
and	1
are	1
heavy	1
laden,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
rest.	1
	1
11:29	1
Take	1
my	1
yoke	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
learn	1
of	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
unto	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
my	1
yoke	1
is	1
easy,	1
and	1
my	1
burden	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
12:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
through	1
the	1
corn;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
12:2	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
disciples	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
12:4	1
How	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
eat,	1
neither	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
priests?	1
	1
12:5	1
Or	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
how	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
profane	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
are	1
blameless?	1
12:6	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
one	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
this	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice,	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
condemned	1
the	1
guiltless.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
thence,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
their	1
synagogue:	1
12:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
withered.	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
man	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
sheep,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
pit	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
lift	1
it	1
out?	1
	1
12:12	1
How	1
much	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
sheep?	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
forth;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
restored	1
whole,	1
like	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
12:14	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
held	1
a	1
council	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
12:15	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
from	1
thence:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
all;	1
12:16	1
And	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known:	1
12:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
12:18	1
Behold	1
my	1
servant,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen;	1
my	1
beloved,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
well	1
pleased:	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
12:19	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
strive,	1
nor	1
cry;	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
12:20	1
A	1
bruised	1
reed	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
smoking	1
flax	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
quench,	1
till	1
he	1
send	1
forth	1
judgment	1
unto	1
victory.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
12:22	1
Then	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil,	1
blind,	1
and	1
dumb:	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
him,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
dumb	1
both	1
spake	1
and	1
saw.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
doth	1
not	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
but	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
every	1
city	1
or	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
12:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan,	1
he	1
is	1
divided	1
against	1
himself;	1
how	1
shall	1
then	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
children	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
12:28	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
then	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:29	1
Or	1
else	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man?	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
12:30	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth	1
abroad.	1
	1
12:31	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
manner	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
blasphemy	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men:	1
but	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him,	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
12:33	1
Either	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
good,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
good;	1
or	1
else	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
corrupt:	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:34	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye,	1
being	1
evil,	1
speak	1
good	1
things?	1
	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
12:35	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
things:	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
things.	1
	1
12:36	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
every	1
idle	1
word	1
that	1
men	1
shall	1
speak,	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
12:37	1
For	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
justified,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
condemned.	1
	1
12:38	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
12:39	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
evil	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas:	1
12:40	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
belly;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:41	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
rise	1
in	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:42	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:43	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest,	1
and	1
findeth	1
none.	1
	1
12:44	1
Then	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
from	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
empty,	1
swept,	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
12:45	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
with	1
himself	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself,	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
Even	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
unto	1
this	1
wicked	1
generation.	1
	1
12:46	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
behold,	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
stood	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:47	1
Then	1
one	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother?	1
	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
my	1
brethren?	1
	1
12:49	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
12:50	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
13:1	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
went	1
Jesus	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
a	1
sower	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
sow;	1
13:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
seeds	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
them	1
up:	1
13:5	1
Some	1
fell	1
upon	1
stony	1
places,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
they	1
sprung	1
up,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
deepness	1
of	1
earth:	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
they	1
were	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
they	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
them:	1
13:8	1
But	1
other	1
fell	1
into	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixtyfold,	1
some	1
thirtyfold.	1
	1
13:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
speakest	1
thou	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables?	1
	1
13:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
given.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
abundance:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
speak	1
I	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
parables:	1
because	1
they	1
seeing	1
see	1
not;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
hear	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
understand.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
Esaias,	1
which	1
saith,	1
By	1
hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
perceive:	1
13:15	1
For	1
this	1
people's	1
heart	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
they	1
have	1
closed;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
should	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
blessed	1
are	1
your	1
eyes,	1
for	1
they	1
see:	1
and	1
your	1
ears,	1
for	1
they	1
hear.	1
	1
13:17	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
righteous	1
men	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
Hear	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
sower.	1
	1
13:19	1
When	1
any	1
one	1
heareth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it	1
not,	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
catcheth	1
away	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
received	1
seed	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side.	1
	1
13:20	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
the	1
seed	1
into	1
stony	1
places,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
anon	1
with	1
joy	1
receiveth	1
it;	1
13:21	1
Yet	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
root	1
in	1
himself,	1
but	1
dureth	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
when	1
tribulation	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
he	1
is	1
offended.	1
	1
13:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
among	1
the	1
thorns	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
he	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it;	1
which	1
also	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
some	1
thirty.	1
	1
13:24	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
sowed	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:25	1
But	1
while	1
men	1
slept,	1
his	1
enemy	1
came	1
and	1
sowed	1
tares	1
among	1
the	1
wheat,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
13:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
blade	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
then	1
appeared	1
the	1
tares	1
also.	1
	1
13:27	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
householder	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
sow	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
thy	1
field?	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hath	1
it	1
tares?	1
	1
13:28	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
enemy	1
hath	1
done	1
this.	1
The	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
up?	1
	1
13:29	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
lest	1
while	1
ye	1
gather	1
up	1
the	1
tares,	1
ye	1
root	1
up	1
also	1
the	1
wheat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
13:30	1
Let	1
both	1
grow	1
together	1
until	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
reapers,	1
Gather	1
ye	1
together	1
first	1
the	1
tares,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
in	1
bundles	1
to	1
burn	1
them:	1
but	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
my	1
barn.	1
	1
13:31	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
sowed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:32	1
Which	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
seeds:	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
grown,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
among	1
herbs,	1
and	1
becometh	1
a	1
tree,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
come	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:33	1
Another	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
unto	1
them;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took,	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:34	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
in	1
parables;	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
13:35	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
parables;	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:36	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
tares	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
13:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
soweth	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man;	1
13:38	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
the	1
world;	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
one;	1
13:39	1
The	1
enemy	1
that	1
sowed	1
them	1
is	1
the	1
devil;	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
the	1
reapers	1
are	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
13:40	1
As	1
therefore	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
gathered	1
and	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
13:41	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
offend,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
iniquity;	1
13:42	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:43	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
shine	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
their	1
Father.	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:44	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
treasure	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
field;	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
found,	1
he	1
hideth,	1
and	1
for	1
joy	1
thereof	1
goeth	1
and	1
selleth	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
and	1
buyeth	1
that	1
field.	1
	1
13:45	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
merchant	1
man,	1
seeking	1
goodly	1
pearls:	1
13:46	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
one	1
pearl	1
of	1
great	1
price,	1
went	1
and	1
sold	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
bought	1
it.	1
	1
13:47	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
net,	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
gathered	1
of	1
every	1
kind:	1
13:48	1
Which,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
full,	1
they	1
drew	1
to	1
shore,	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
good	1
into	1
vessels,	1
but	1
cast	1
the	1
bad	1
away.	1
	1
13:49	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
the	1
angels	1
shall	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
sever	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
just,	1
13:50	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:51	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
understood	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:52	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Therefore	1
every	1
scribe	1
which	1
is	1
instructed	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasure	1
things	1
new	1
and	1
old.	1
	1
13:53	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
parables,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
13:54	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
astonished,	1
and	1
said,	1
Whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
this	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
these	1
mighty	1
works?	1
	1
13:55	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
son?	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
mother	1
called	1
Mary?	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Simon,	1
and	1
Judas?	1
	1
13:56	1
And	1
his	1
sisters,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
with	1
us?	1
Whence	1
then	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
13:57	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
in	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
save	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
13:58	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
many	1
mighty	1
works	1
there	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
	1
14:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
14:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
This	1
is	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Herod	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife.	1
	1
14:4	1
For	1
John	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
counted	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
14:6	1
But	1
when	1
Herod's	1
birthday	1
was	1
kept,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Herodias	1
danced	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod.	1
	1
14:7	1
Whereupon	1
he	1
promised	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
would	1
ask.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
she,	1
being	1
before	1
instructed	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
said,	1
Give	1
me	1
here	1
John	1
Baptist's	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
sorry:	1
nevertheless	1
for	1
the	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
meat,	1
he	1
commanded	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
he	1
sent,	1
and	1
beheaded	1
John	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
buried	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
by	1
ship	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
apart:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
they	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
their	1
sick.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
evening,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
now	1
past;	1
send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
victuals.	1
	1
14:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
need	1
not	1
depart;	1
give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
here	1
but	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
14:18	1
He	1
said,	1
Bring	1
them	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
loaves	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
apart	1
to	1
pray:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
alone.	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
tossed	1
with	1
waves:	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
for	1
fear.	1
	1
14:27	1
But	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
thou,	1
bid	1
me	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come.	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:30	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wind	1
boisterous,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid;	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
sink,	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
immediately	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
doubt?	1
14:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased.	1
	1
14:33	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
came	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:34	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased;	1
14:36	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
were	1
made	1
perfectly	1
whole.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Why	1
do	1
thy	1
disciples	1
transgress	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders?	1
for	1
they	1
wash	1
not	1
their	1
hands	1
when	1
they	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
15:3	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
your	1
tradition?	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
God	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother:	1
and,	1
He	1
that	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
15:6	1
And	1
honour	1
not	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
Thus	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
by	1
your	1
tradition.	1
	1
15:7	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
well	1
did	1
Esaias	1
prophesy	1
of	1
you,	1
saying,	1
15:8	1
This	1
people	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips;	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
in	1
vain	1
they	1
do	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
and	1
understand:	1
15:11	1
Not	1
that	1
which	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
defileth	1
a	1
man;	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth,	1
this	1
defileth	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
offended,	1
after	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Every	1
plant,	1
which	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
planted,	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
15:14	1
Let	1
them	1
alone:	1
they	1
be	1
blind	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
blind.	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind,	1
both	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch.	1
	1
15:15	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
this	1
parable.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
yet	1
without	1
understanding?	1
	1
15:17	1
Do	1
not	1
ye	1
yet	1
understand,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
entereth	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
is	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught?	1
	1
15:18	1
But	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
15:19	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
murders,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
thefts,	1
false	1
witness,	1
blasphemies:	1
15:20	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
defile	1
a	1
man:	1
but	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands	1
defileth	1
not	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
thence,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon.	1
	1
15:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Canaan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
coasts,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
grievously	1
vexed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
her	1
away;	1
for	1
she	1
crieth	1
after	1
us.	1
	1
15:24	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sent	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:25	1
Then	1
came	1
she	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
to	1
dogs.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Truth,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fall	1
from	1
their	1
masters'	1
table.	1
	1
15:28	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
O	1
woman,	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
faith:	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
And	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
there.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
having	1
with	1
them	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
blind,	1
dumb,	1
maimed,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them:	1
15:31	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
multitude	1
wondered,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
maimed	1
to	1
be	1
whole,	1
the	1
lame	1
to	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
to	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
continue	1
with	1
me	1
now	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting,	1
lest	1
they	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
should	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
to	1
fill	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
multitude?	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
little	1
fishes.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
fishes,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
them,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
were	1
four	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
took	1
ship,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Magdala.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
came,	1
and	1
tempting	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
them	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:2	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
evening,	1
ye	1
say,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
fair	1
weather:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
foul	1
weather	1
to	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red	1
and	1
lowering.	1
O	1
ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky;	1
but	1
can	1
ye	1
not	1
discern	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
times?	1
	1
16:4	1
A	1
wicked	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas.	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread.	1
	1
16:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
taken	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
16:8	1
Which	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
why	1
reason	1
ye	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
no	1
bread?	1
	1
16:9	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
yet	1
understand,	1
neither	1
remember	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:10	1
Neither	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:11	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
you	1
concerning	1
bread,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees?	1
	1
16:12	1
Then	1
understood	1
they	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
not	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
bread,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi,	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
am?	1
16:14	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Some	1
say	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
some,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
Jeremias,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
16:15	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou,	1
Simon	1
Barjona:	1
for	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
hath	1
not	1
revealed	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
thou	1
art	1
Peter,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
rock	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
my	1
church;	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
hell	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:20	1
Then	1
charged	1
he	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:21	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
began	1
Jesus	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
suffer	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
16:22	1
Then	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
Lord:	1
this	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
16:23	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
offence	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
16:24	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
16:25	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
16:26	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
profited,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
his	1
angels;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
reward	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
16:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
Peter,	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart,	1
17:2	1
And	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
did	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
17:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias	1
talking	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
here	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
17:5	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold,	1
a	1
bright	1
cloud	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased;	1
hear	1
ye	1
him.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
face,	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
Jesus	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
the	1
vision	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
until	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
then	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Elias	1
truly	1
shall	1
first	1
come,	1
and	1
restore	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
17:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
come	1
already,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed.	1
Likewise	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
suffer	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
17:13	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
17:15	1
Lord,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
sore	1
vexed:	1
for	1
ofttimes	1
he	1
falleth	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
oft	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cure	1
him.	1
	1
17:17	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
devil;	1
and	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
cured	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
17:19	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
Jesus	1
apart,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
of	1
your	1
unbelief:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Remove	1
hence	1
to	1
yonder	1
place;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remove;	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:21	1
Howbeit	1
this	1
kind	1
goeth	1
not	1
out	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men:	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
again.	1
	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorry.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
they	1
that	1
received	1
tribute	1
money	1
came	1
to	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said,	1
Doth	1
not	1
your	1
master	1
pay	1
tribute?	1
17:25	1
He	1
saith,	1
Yes.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
Jesus	1
prevented	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
Simon?	1
of	1
whom	1
do	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
take	1
custom	1
or	1
tribute?	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
children,	1
or	1
of	1
strangers?	1
	1
17:26	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Of	1
strangers.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Then	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
free.	1
	1
17:27	1
Notwithstanding,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
offend	1
them,	1
go	1
thou	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
cast	1
an	1
hook,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
first	1
cometh	1
up;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
money:	1
that	1
take,	1
and	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
18:1	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven?	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
called	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
18:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
become	1
as	1
little	1
children,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:4	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
as	1
this	1
little	1
child,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
such	1
little	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
But	1
whoso	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
which	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
18:7	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
of	1
offences!	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
offences	1
come;	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
offence	1
cometh!	1
	1
18:8	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
or	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
halt	1
or	1
maimed,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
or	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
18:10	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
despise	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones;	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
heaven	1
their	1
angels	1
do	1
always	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:11	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
18:12	1
How	1
think	1
ye?	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
gone	1
astray,	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
seeketh	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
astray?	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
find	1
it,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
rejoiceth	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
sheep,	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
which	1
went	1
not	1
astray.	1
	1
18:14	1
Even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
should	1
perish.	1
	1
18:15	1
Moreover	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
his	1
fault	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
alone:	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
thee,	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
thee,	1
then	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
more,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
every	1
word	1
may	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
them,	1
tell	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
church,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
as	1
an	1
heathen	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:18	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:19	1
Again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
if	1
two	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
agree	1
on	1
earth	1
as	1
touching	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
ask,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:20	1
For	1
where	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
there	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
18:21	1
Then	1
came	1
Peter	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
oft	1
shall	1
my	1
brother	1
sin	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
forgive	1
him?	1
till	1
seven	1
times?	1
	1
18:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Until	1
seven	1
times:	1
but,	1
Until	1
seventy	1
times	1
seven.	1
	1
18:23	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reckon,	1
one	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
talents.	1
	1
18:25	1
But	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
pay,	1
his	1
lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
payment	1
to	1
be	1
made.	1
	1
18:26	1
The	1
servant	1
therefore	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:27	1
Then	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
and	1
loosed	1
him,	1
and	1
forgave	1
him	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:28	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
servant	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
pence:	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
throat,	1
saying,	1
Pay	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
owest.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
his	1
fellowservant	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not:	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:31	1
So	1
when	1
his	1
fellowservants	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
sorry,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
unto	1
their	1
lord	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
18:32	1
Then	1
his	1
lord,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant,	1
I	1
forgave	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
debt,	1
because	1
thou	1
desiredst	1
me:	1
18:33	1
Shouldest	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
have	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
thee?	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
his	1
lord	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
tormentors,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
due	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
18:35	1
So	1
likewise	1
shall	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
do	1
also	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
from	1
your	1
hearts	1
forgive	1
not	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
brother	1
their	1
trespasses.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
19:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
19:3	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
every	1
cause?	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female,	1
19:5	1
And	1
said,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh?	1
	1
19:6	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
19:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
did	1
Moses	1
then	1
command	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away?	1
	1
19:8	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
suffered	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
your	1
wives:	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
fornication,	1
and	1
shall	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whoso	1
marrieth	1
her	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
doth	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
19:10	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
marry.	1
	1
19:11	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
men	1
cannot	1
receive	1
this	1
saying,	1
save	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
given.	1
	1
19:12	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
born	1
from	1
their	1
mother's	1
womb:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
eunuchs	1
of	1
men:	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
have	1
made	1
themselves	1
eunuchs	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven's	1
sake.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
little	1
children,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
pray:	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not,	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
19:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
good	1
thing	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
enter	1
into	1
life,	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments.	1
	1
19:18	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Which?	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
no	1
murder,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
19:19	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother:	1
and,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
19:20	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up:	1
what	1
lack	1
I	1
yet?	1
	1
19:21	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
perfect,	1
go	1
and	1
sell	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
19:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
shall	1
hardly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:25	1
When	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
amazed,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
19:26	1
But	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
men	1
this	1
is	1
impossible;	1
but	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
19:27	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee;	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
therefore?	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
which	1
have	1
followed	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
regeneration	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
twelve	1
thrones,	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
houses,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
and	1
shall	1
inherit	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
19:30	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first.	1
	1
20:1	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
hire	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
labourers	1
for	1
a	1
penny	1
a	1
day,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
saw	1
others	1
standing	1
idle	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
20:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them;	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
20:5	1
Again	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
and	1
ninth	1
hour,	1
and	1
did	1
likewise.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
others	1
standing	1
idle,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
stand	1
ye	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
idle?	1
	1
20:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
hired	1
us.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive.	1
	1
20:8	1
So	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
steward,	1
Call	1
the	1
labourers,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
hire,	1
beginning	1
from	1
the	1
last	1
unto	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
that	1
were	1
hired	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour,	1
they	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:10	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
came,	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
more;	1
and	1
they	1
likewise	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
it,	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
20:12	1
Saying,	1
These	1
last	1
have	1
wrought	1
but	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
them	1
equal	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
burden	1
and	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
20:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Friend,	1
I	1
do	1
thee	1
no	1
wrong:	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
penny?	1
	1
20:14	1
Take	1
that	1
thine	1
is,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
this	1
last,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
20:15	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
mine	1
own?	1
Is	1
thine	1
eye	1
evil,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
good?	1
	1
20:16	1
So	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
last:	1
for	1
many	1
be	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
chosen.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
took	1
the	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
apart	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
20:18	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
20:19	1
And	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
mock,	1
and	1
to	1
scourge,	1
and	1
to	1
crucify	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
20:20	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children	1
with	1
her	1
sons,	1
worshipping	1
him,	1
and	1
desiring	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
that	1
these	1
my	1
two	1
sons	1
may	1
sit,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
20:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask.	1
Are	1
ye	1
able	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
drink	1
of,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
able.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
drink	1
indeed	1
of	1
my	1
cup,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with:	1
but	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left,	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
with	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
two	1
brethren.	1
	1
20:25	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
dominion	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
great	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:26	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
minister;	1
20:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
chief	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
servant:	1
20:28	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
20:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace:	1
but	1
they	1
cried	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
you?	1
	1
20:33	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
20:34	1
So	1
Jesus	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
touched	1
their	1
eyes:	1
and	1
immediately	1
their	1
eyes	1
received	1
sight,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bethphage,	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
then	1
sent	1
Jesus	1
two	1
disciples,	1
21:2	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
straightway	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
an	1
ass	1
tied,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
with	1
her:	1
loose	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
ought	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
them.	1
	1
21:4	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
21:5	1
Tell	1
ye	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
meek,	1
and	1
sitting	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
went,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
commanded	1
them,	1
21:7	1
And	1
brought	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
them	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
thereon.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
multitude	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
multitudes	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this?	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
Jesus	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
21:13	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
saw	1
the	1
wonderful	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
displeased,	1
21:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
what	1
these	1
say?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yea;	1
have	1
ye	1
never	1
read,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
babes	1
and	1
sucklings	1
thou	1
hast	1
perfected	1
praise?	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
into	1
Bethany;	1
and	1
he	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
21:18	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
he	1
hungered.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
nothing	1
thereon,	1
but	1
leaves	1
only,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
Let	1
no	1
fruit	1
grow	1
on	1
thee	1
henceforward	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
presently	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
soon	1
is	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away!	1
	1
21:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith,	1
and	1
doubt	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
but	1
also	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
all	1
things,	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
prayer,	1
believing,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
and	1
said,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing,	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
in	1
like	1
wise	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:25	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
whence	1
was	1
it?	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
us,	1
Why	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
21:26	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
we	1
fear	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
all	1
hold	1
John	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:28	1
But	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
said,	1
Son,	1
go	1
work	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
21:29	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
repented,	1
and	1
went.	1
	1
21:30	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
said	1
likewise.	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
go,	1
sir:	1
and	1
went	1
not.	1
	1
21:31	1
Whether	1
of	1
them	1
twain	1
did	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
father?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
first.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
21:32	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
believed	1
him:	1
and	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
repented	1
not	1
afterward,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
21:33	1
Hear	1
another	1
parable:	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
householder,	1
which	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
hedged	1
it	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
winepress	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
21:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
drew	1
near,	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
beat	1
one,	1
and	1
killed	1
another,	1
and	1
stoned	1
another.	1
	1
21:36	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
other	1
servants	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:37	1
But	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
son,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:38	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
the	1
son,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
seize	1
on	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
21:39	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
21:40	1
When	1
the	1
lord	1
therefore	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
cometh,	1
what	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
unto	1
those	1
husbandmen?	1
	1
21:41	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
will	1
miserably	1
destroy	1
those	1
wicked	1
men,	1
and	1
will	1
let	1
out	1
his	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
other	1
husbandmen,	1
which	1
shall	1
render	1
him	1
the	1
fruits	1
in	1
their	1
seasons.	1
	1
21:42	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Did	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
21:43	1
Therefore	1
say	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
nation	1
bringing	1
forth	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
on	1
this	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
21:45	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
parables,	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:46	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
again	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said,	1
22:2	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
22:3	1
And	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden	1
to	1
the	1
wedding:	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
22:4	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
other	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
bidden,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
my	1
dinner:	1
my	1
oxen	1
and	1
my	1
fatlings	1
are	1
killed,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
ready:	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
they	1
made	1
light	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways,	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
farm,	1
another	1
to	1
his	1
merchandise:	1
22:6	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
entreated	1
them	1
spitefully,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
22:7	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
was	1
wroth:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
armies,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
those	1
murderers,	1
and	1
burned	1
up	1
their	1
city.	1
	1
22:8	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
The	1
wedding	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
were	1
not	1
worthy.	1
	1
22:9	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
find,	1
bid	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:10	1
So	1
those	1
servants	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
they	1
found,	1
both	1
bad	1
and	1
good:	1
and	1
the	1
wedding	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
guests.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
guests,	1
he	1
saw	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
on	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment:	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
how	1
camest	1
thou	1
in	1
hither	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment?	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
speechless.	1
	1
22:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
the	1
servants,	1
Bind	1
him	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
22:14	1
For	1
many	1
are	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
are	1
chosen.	1
	1
22:15	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
entangle	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
talk.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
their	1
disciples	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth,	1
neither	1
carest	1
thou	1
for	1
any	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
22:17	1
Tell	1
us	1
therefore,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou?	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
22:18	1
But	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me,	1
ye	1
hypocrites?	1
	1
22:19	1
Shew	1
me	1
the	1
tribute	1
money.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
22:21	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Caesar's;	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
22:22	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
22:23	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
22:24	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
said,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
die,	1
having	1
no	1
children,	1
his	1
brother	1
shall	1
marry	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
22:25	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
deceased,	1
and,	1
having	1
no	1
issue,	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
his	1
brother:	1
22:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
second	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
unto	1
the	1
seventh.	1
	1
22:27	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
22:28	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
seven?	1
	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
her.	1
	1
22:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
do	1
err,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
nor	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:30	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
22:31	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
God,	1
saying,	1
22:32	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
multitude	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
22:34	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
to	1
silence,	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
22:35	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
question,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
22:36	1
Master,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
commandment	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
22:37	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind.	1
	1
22:38	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
great	1
commandment.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
it,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:40	1
On	1
these	1
two	1
commandments	1
hang	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
22:41	1
While	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
them,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
What	1
think	1
ye	1
of	1
Christ?	1
whose	1
son	1
is	1
he?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
22:43	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
then	1
doth	1
David	1
in	1
spirit	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
saying,	1
22:44	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
22:45	1
If	1
David	1
then	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
22:46	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
a	1
word,	1
neither	1
durst	1
any	1
man	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
more	1
questions.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
23:2	1
Saying	1
The	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
sit	1
in	1
Moses'	1
seat:	1
23:3	1
All	1
therefore	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
bid	1
you	1
observe,	1
that	1
observe	1
and	1
do;	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
after	1
their	1
works:	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
and	1
do	1
not.	1
	1
23:4	1
For	1
they	1
bind	1
heavy	1
burdens	1
and	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
men's	1
shoulders;	1
but	1
they	1
themselves	1
will	1
not	1
move	1
them	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
fingers.	1
	1
23:5	1
But	1
all	1
their	1
works	1
they	1
do	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men:	1
they	1
make	1
broad	1
their	1
phylacteries,	1
and	1
enlarge	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
garments,	1
23:6	1
And	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
23:7	1
And	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
men,	1
Rabbi,	1
Rabbi.	1
	1
23:8	1
But	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
called	1
Rabbi:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ;	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
call	1
no	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Father,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
23:10	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
called	1
masters:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ.	1
	1
23:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
servant.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
23:13	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
against	1
men:	1
for	1
ye	1
neither	1
go	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
neither	1
suffer	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
entering	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
23:14	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayer:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
23:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
compass	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
proselyte,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
made,	1
ye	1
make	1
him	1
twofold	1
more	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
hell	1
than	1
yourselves.	1
	1
23:16	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor!	1
	1
23:17	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gold,	1
or	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gold?	1
	1
23:18	1
And,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty.	1
	1
23:19	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gift,	1
or	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gift?	1
	1
23:20	1
Whoso	1
therefore	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
things	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
heaven,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:23	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
pay	1
tithe	1
of	1
mint	1
and	1
anise	1
and	1
cummin,	1
and	1
have	1
omitted	1
the	1
weightier	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
judgment,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
faith:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
23:24	1
Ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
strain	1
at	1
a	1
gnat,	1
and	1
swallow	1
a	1
camel.	1
	1
23:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
platter,	1
but	1
within	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
extortion	1
and	1
excess.	1
	1
23:26	1
Thou	1
blind	1
Pharisee,	1
cleanse	1
first	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
platter,	1
that	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
clean	1
also.	1
	1
23:27	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
whited	1
sepulchres,	1
which	1
indeed	1
appear	1
beautiful	1
outward,	1
but	1
are	1
within	1
full	1
of	1
dead	1
men's	1
bones,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
23:28	1
Even	1
so	1
ye	1
also	1
outwardly	1
appear	1
righteous	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
within	1
ye	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
iniquity.	1
	1
23:29	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
because	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
tombs	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
garnish	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
righteous,	1
23:30	1
And	1
say,	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
partakers	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:31	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
killed	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:32	1
Fill	1
ye	1
up	1
then	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
23:33	1
Ye	1
serpents,	1
ye	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
escape	1
the	1
damnation	1
of	1
hell?	1
	1
23:34	1
Wherefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
prophets,	1
and	1
wise	1
men,	1
and	1
scribes:	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
kill	1
and	1
crucify;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
scourge	1
in	1
your	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
persecute	1
them	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city:	1
23:35	1
That	1
upon	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
all	1
the	1
righteous	1
blood	1
shed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
righteous	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
son	1
of	1
Barachias,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
between	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
23:36	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
23:37	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
thou	1
that	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
gathereth	1
her	1
chickens	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
23:38	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate.	1
	1
23:39	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
henceforth,	1
till	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
him	1
the	1
buildings	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
See	1
ye	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
here	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
privately,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
thy	1
coming,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars:	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
24:7	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences,	1
and	1
earthquakes,	1
in	1
divers	1
places.	1
	1
24:8	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
offended,	1
and	1
shall	1
betray	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
shall	1
hate	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
because	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
abound,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
many	1
shall	1
wax	1
cold.	1
	1
24:13	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
this	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
nations;	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
come.	1
	1
24:15	1
When	1
ye	1
therefore	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
(whoso	1
readeth,	1
let	1
him	1
understand:)	1
24:16	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
mountains:	1
24:17	1
Let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
24:18	1
Neither	1
let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
return	1
back	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
24:20	1
But	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
neither	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
24:21	1
For	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
this	1
time,	1
no,	1
nor	1
ever	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
except	1
those	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
shortened,	1
there	1
should	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
shortened.	1
	1
24:23	1
Then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ,	1
or	1
there;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:24	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
false	1
Christs,	1
and	1
false	1
prophets,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
great	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders;	1
insomuch	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
they	1
shall	1
deceive	1
the	1
very	1
elect.	1
	1
24:25	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before.	1
	1
24:26	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
go	1
not	1
forth:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
chambers;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:27	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
shineth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
west;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:28	1
For	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
carcase	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
24:29	1
Immediately	1
after	1
the	1
tribulation	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken:	1
24:30	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
appear	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
mourn,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
his	1
angels	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
24:32	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
his	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
nigh:	1
24:33	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
24:34	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
24:35	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away,	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
24:36	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
only.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe	1
were,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:38	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
the	1
flood	1
they	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
marrying	1
and	1
giving	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
24:39	1
And	1
knew	1
not	1
until	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
away;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:40	1
Then	1
shall	1
two	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:41	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
at	1
the	1
mill;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:42	1
Watch	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
hour	1
your	1
Lord	1
doth	1
come.	1
	1
24:43	1
But	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
what	1
watch	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
up.	1
	1
24:44	1
Therefore	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
ready:	1
for	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
hour	1
as	1
ye	1
think	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
24:45	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
hath	1
made	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
24:46	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
24:47	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
24:48	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
evil	1
servant	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
24:49	1
And	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
smite	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
the	1
drunken;	1
24:50	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware	1
of,	1
24:51	1
And	1
shall	1
cut	1
him	1
asunder,	1
and	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
hypocrites:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
ten	1
virgins,	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
five	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
wise,	1
and	1
five	1
were	1
foolish.	1
	1
25:3	1
They	1
that	1
were	1
foolish	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
took	1
no	1
oil	1
with	1
them:	1
25:4	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
took	1
oil	1
in	1
their	1
vessels	1
with	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:5	1
While	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
tarried,	1
they	1
all	1
slumbered	1
and	1
slept.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cry	1
made,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
cometh;	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
25:7	1
Then	1
all	1
those	1
virgins	1
arose,	1
and	1
trimmed	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
the	1
foolish	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
Give	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
oil;	1
for	1
our	1
lamps	1
are	1
gone	1
out.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
so;	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
and	1
you:	1
but	1
go	1
ye	1
rather	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sell,	1
and	1
buy	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
buy,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
came;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
ready	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
marriage:	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut.	1
	1
25:11	1
Afterward	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
virgins,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
25:12	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
25:13	1
Watch	1
therefore,	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
neither	1
the	1
day	1
nor	1
the	1
hour	1
wherein	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
25:14	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
travelling	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
who	1
called	1
his	1
own	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
25:15	1
And	1
unto	1
one	1
he	1
gave	1
five	1
talents,	1
to	1
another	1
two,	1
and	1
to	1
another	1
one;	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
several	1
ability;	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
his	1
journey.	1
	1
25:16	1
Then	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
five	1
talents	1
went	1
and	1
traded	1
with	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
other	1
five	1
talents.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
likewise	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two,	1
he	1
also	1
gained	1
other	1
two.	1
	1
25:18	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
one	1
went	1
and	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
lord's	1
money.	1
	1
25:19	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
those	1
servants	1
cometh,	1
and	1
reckoneth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
five	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
other	1
five	1
talents,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
five	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
beside	1
them	1
five	1
talents	1
more.	1
	1
25:21	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
thou	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant:	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
two	1
other	1
talents	1
beside	1
them.	1
	1
25:23	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant;	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:24	1
Then	1
he	1
which	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
one	1
talent	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
knew	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
hard	1
man,	1
reaping	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sown,	1
and	1
gathering	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:25	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hid	1
thy	1
talent	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
lo,	1
there	1
thou	1
hast	1
that	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
25:26	1
His	1
lord	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wicked	1
and	1
slothful	1
servant,	1
thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
reap	1
where	1
I	1
sowed	1
not,	1
and	1
gather	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:27	1
Thou	1
oughtest	1
therefore	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
exchangers,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury.	1
	1
25:28	1
Take	1
therefore	1
the	1
talent	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
hath	1
ten	1
talents.	1
	1
25:29	1
For	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
abundance:	1
but	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
cast	1
ye	1
the	1
unprofitable	1
servant	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:31	1
When	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
angels	1
with	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory:	1
25:32	1
And	1
before	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
separate	1
them	1
one	1
from	1
another,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
divideth	1
his	1
sheep	1
from	1
the	1
goats:	1
25:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
sheep	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
but	1
the	1
goats	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
25:34	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
King	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
Come,	1
ye	1
blessed	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
prepared	1
for	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
25:35	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
drink:	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
in:	1
25:36	1
Naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:37	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
fed	1
thee?	1
or	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
gave	1
thee	1
drink?	1
	1
25:38	1
When	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
took	1
thee	1
in?	1
or	1
naked,	1
and	1
clothed	1
thee?	1
	1
25:39	1
Or	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:40	1
And	1
the	1
King	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:41	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
cursed,	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire,	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
his	1
angels:	1
25:42	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
drink:	1
25:43	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not	1
in:	1
naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me	1
not:	1
sick,	1
and	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
25:44	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
also	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
or	1
athirst,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
naked,	1
or	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:45	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
answer	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these,	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
25:46	1
And	1
these	1
shall	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
everlasting	1
punishment:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
into	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
26:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
is	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
26:3	1
Then	1
assembled	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
unto	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Caiaphas,	1
26:4	1
And	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
Jesus	1
by	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
26:5	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:6	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
in	1
Bethany,	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
26:7	1
There	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
very	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat.	1
	1
26:8	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
had	1
indignation,	1
saying,	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
is	1
this	1
waste?	1
	1
26:9	1
For	1
this	1
ointment	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
much,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
26:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
understood	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
the	1
woman?	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
26:11	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
26:12	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
poured	1
this	1
ointment	1
on	1
my	1
body,	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
burial.	1
	1
26:13	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
this,	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
done,	1
be	1
told	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
26:14	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
give	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
you?	1
And	1
they	1
covenanted	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
26:16	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
26:17	1
Now	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
thy	1
house	1
with	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
26:20	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
began	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
dippeth	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:24	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
26:25	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
26:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
eating,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat;	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Drink	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
it;	1
26:28	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
26:29	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
henceforth	1
of	1
this	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
kingdom.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
26:31	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
26:32	1
But	1
after	1
I	1
am	1
risen	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:33	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
never	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
26:34	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
26:35	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
deny	1
thee.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:36	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Gethsemane,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
pray	1
yonder.	1
	1
26:37	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
very	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:38	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
even	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:39	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
let	1
this	1
cup	1
pass	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
26:40	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
asleep,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
What,	1
could	1
ye	1
not	1
watch	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
26:41	1
Watch	1
and	1
pray,	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation:	1
the	1
spirit	1
indeed	1
is	1
willing,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
26:42	1
He	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
this	1
cup	1
may	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
except	1
I	1
drink	1
it,	1
thy	1
will	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
26:43	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again:	1
for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:44	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
again,	1
and	1
prayed	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
26:45	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
26:46	1
Rise,	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
going:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
doth	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
lo,	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:48	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
sign,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he:	1
hold	1
him	1
fast.	1
	1
26:49	1
And	1
forthwith	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
26:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
wherefore	1
art	1
thou	1
come?	1
Then	1
came	1
they,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
Jesus	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
26:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
struck	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest's,	1
and	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
26:52	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
up	1
again	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
his	1
place:	1
for	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:53	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
now	1
pray	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
presently	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
twelve	1
legions	1
of	1
angels?	1
	1
26:54	1
But	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
scriptures	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
thus	1
it	1
must	1
be?	1
	1
26:55	1
In	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
I	1
sat	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
ye	1
laid	1
no	1
hold	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
26:56	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
disciples	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
26:57	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
Jesus	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
where	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
assembled.	1
	1
26:58	1
But	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
palace,	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
26:59	1
Now	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council,	1
sought	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
26:60	1
But	1
found	1
none:	1
yea,	1
though	1
many	1
false	1
witnesses	1
came,	1
yet	1
found	1
they	1
none.	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
came	1
two	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
26:61	1
And	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
26:62	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
arose,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
26:63	1
But	1
Jesus	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
26:64	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
26:65	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
spoken	1
blasphemy;	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
have	1
we	1
of	1
witnesses?	1
behold,	1
now	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
26:66	1
What	1
think	1
ye?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
26:67	1
Then	1
did	1
they	1
spit	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
buffeted	1
him;	1
and	1
others	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
26:68	1
Saying,	1
Prophesy	1
unto	1
us,	1
thou	1
Christ,	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
26:69	1
Now	1
Peter	1
sat	1
without	1
in	1
the	1
palace:	1
and	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:70	1
But	1
he	1
denied	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
26:71	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch,	1
another	1
maid	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
This	1
fellow	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:72	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
denied	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
26:73	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
also	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
thy	1
speech	1
bewrayeth	1
thee.	1
	1
26:74	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
man.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
26:75	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
27:1	1
When	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
come,	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
counsel	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
27:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
bound	1
him,	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
27:3	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
had	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
condemned,	1
repented	1
himself,	1
and	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
27:4	1
Saying,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
us?	1
see	1
thou	1
to	1
that.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hanged	1
himself.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
took	1
the	1
silver	1
pieces,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
treasury,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
counsel,	1
and	1
bought	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
to	1
bury	1
strangers	1
in.	1
	1
27:8	1
Wherefore	1
that	1
field	1
was	1
called,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:9	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
valued,	1
whom	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
value;	1
27:10	1
And	1
gave	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
appointed	1
me.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
governor:	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
not	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
to	1
never	1
a	1
word;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
marvelled	1
greatly.	1
	1
27:15	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
release	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
whom	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
a	1
notable	1
prisoner,	1
called	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:17	1
Therefore	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
Barabbas,	1
or	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
	1
27:18	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
envy	1
they	1
had	1
delivered	1
him.	1
	1
27:19	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
his	1
wife	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
thou	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
just	1
man:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
27:20	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
persuaded	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
Barabbas,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Jesus.	1
	1
27:21	1
The	1
governor	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
of	1
the	1
twain	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
They	1
said,	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:22	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
then	1
with	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
They	1
all	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:23	1
And	1
the	1
governor	1
said,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:24	1
When	1
Pilate	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
prevail	1
nothing,	1
but	1
that	1
rather	1
a	1
tumult	1
was	1
made,	1
he	1
took	1
water,	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
innocent	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
this	1
just	1
person:	1
see	1
ye	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
27:25	1
Then	1
answered	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
His	1
blood	1
be	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
children.	1
	1
27:26	1
Then	1
released	1
he	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:27	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
took	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
common	1
hall,	1
and	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
band	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
	1
27:28	1
And	1
they	1
stripped	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
scarlet	1
robe.	1
	1
27:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
they	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
reed	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
robe	1
off	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
raiment	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
Simon	1
by	1
name:	1
him	1
they	1
compelled	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Golgotha,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
27:34	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
vinegar	1
to	1
drink	1
mingled	1
with	1
gall:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tasted	1
thereof,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
garments	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
vesture	1
did	1
they	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
27:36	1
And	1
sitting	1
down	1
they	1
watched	1
him	1
there;	1
27:37	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
accusation	1
written,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
JESUS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
27:38	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
two	1
thieves	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
reviled	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
27:40	1
And	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
27:41	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
elders,	1
said,	1
27:42	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
him	1
now	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
27:43	1
He	1
trusted	1
in	1
God;	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
him	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:44	1
The	1
thieves	1
also,	1
which	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
his	1
teeth.	1
	1
27:45	1
Now	1
from	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
27:46	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eli,	1
Eli,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
27:47	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
calleth	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
27:48	1
And	1
straightway	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
ran,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
spunge,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
27:49	1
The	1
rest	1
said,	1
Let	1
be,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
him.	1
	1
27:50	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
27:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
quake,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
rent;	1
27:52	1
And	1
the	1
graves	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
many	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
slept	1
arose,	1
27:53	1
And	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
graves	1
after	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
appeared	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
27:54	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
watching	1
Jesus,	1
saw	1
the	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done,	1
they	1
feared	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
Truly	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:55	1
And	1
many	1
women	1
were	1
there	1
beholding	1
afar	1
off,	1
which	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
ministering	1
unto	1
him:	1
27:56	1
Among	1
which	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children.	1
	1
27:57	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
was	1
Jesus'	1
disciple:	1
27:58	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
commanded	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
27:59	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
body,	1
he	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
27:60	1
And	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
new	1
tomb,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hewn	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
rock:	1
and	1
he	1
rolled	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
27:61	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary,	1
sitting	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
27:62	1
Now	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
preparation,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
27:63	1
Saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
remember	1
that	1
that	1
deceiver	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
After	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
27:64	1
Command	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
be	1
made	1
sure	1
until	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
lest	1
his	1
disciples	1
come	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
steal	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
He	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
so	1
the	1
last	1
error	1
shall	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
27:65	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
a	1
watch:	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
ye	1
can.	1
	1
27:66	1
So	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
sure,	1
sealing	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
setting	1
a	1
watch.	1
	1
28:1	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
as	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
toward	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
came	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
28:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake:	1
for	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
descended	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
rolled	1
back	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
28:3	1
His	1
countenance	1
was	1
like	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
white	1
as	1
snow:	1
28:4	1
And	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
keepers	1
did	1
shake,	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
women,	1
Fear	1
not	1
ye:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
seek	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
28:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
risen,	1
as	1
he	1
said.	1
Come,	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Lord	1
lay.	1
	1
28:7	1
And	1
go	1
quickly,	1
and	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him:	1
lo,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
quickly	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
great	1
joy;	1
and	1
did	1
run	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
disciples	1
word.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples,	1
behold,	1
Jesus	1
met	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
hail.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
28:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid:	1
go	1
tell	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
me.	1
	1
28:11	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
behold,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
watch	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shewed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
counsel,	1
they	1
gave	1
large	1
money	1
unto	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
28:13	1
Saying,	1
Say	1
ye,	1
His	1
disciples	1
came	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
stole	1
him	1
away	1
while	1
we	1
slept.	1
	1
28:14	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
governor's	1
ears,	1
we	1
will	1
persuade	1
him,	1
and	1
secure	1
you.	1
	1
28:15	1
So	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
taught:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
is	1
commonly	1
reported	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:16	1
Then	1
the	1
eleven	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
where	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
but	1
some	1
doubted.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
power	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
28:19	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
teach	1
all	1
nations,	1
baptizing	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
28:20	1
Teaching	1
them	1
to	1
observe	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you	1
alway,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Mark	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
1:2	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
did	1
baptize	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
John	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
girdle	1
of	1
a	1
skin	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey;	1
1:7	1
And	1
preached,	1
saying,	1
There	1
cometh	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
after	1
me,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
stoop	1
down	1
and	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
indeed	1
have	1
baptized	1
you	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
came	1
from	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized	1
of	1
John	1
in	1
Jordan.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
like	1
a	1
dove	1
descending	1
upon	1
him:	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
spirit	1
driveth	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
days,	1
tempted	1
of	1
Satan;	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts;	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
1:14	1
Now	1
after	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
prison,	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
1:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
fulfilled,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
repent	1
ye,	1
and	1
believe	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
saw	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
become	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
straightway	1
they	1
forsook	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
mending	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
called	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
their	1
father	1
Zebedee	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
the	1
hired	1
servants,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
Capernaum;	1
and	1
straightway	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
1:24	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
had	1
torn	1
him,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:27	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
questioned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thing	1
is	1
this?	1
what	1
new	1
doctrine	1
is	1
this?	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
commandeth	1
he	1
even	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
fame	1
spread	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Galilee.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
forthwith,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever,	1
and	1
anon	1
they	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up;	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
at	1
even,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
set,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
he	1
healed	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick	1
of	1
divers	1
diseases,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils;	1
and	1
suffered	1
not	1
the	1
devils	1
to	1
speak,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him.	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
rising	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
before	1
day,	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
solitary	1
place,	1
and	1
there	1
prayed.	1
	1
1:36	1
And	1
Simon	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
followed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
men	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
towns,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preach	1
there	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues	1
throughout	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
1:40	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
to	1
him,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
and	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
him,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
sent	1
him	1
away;	1
1:44	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:45	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
much,	1
and	1
to	1
blaze	1
abroad	1
the	1
matter,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Jesus	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
was	1
without	1
in	1
desert	1
places:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
quarter.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum	1
after	1
some	1
days;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
noised	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
straightway	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
about	1
the	1
door:	1
and	1
he	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
bringing	1
one	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
which	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
four.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
they	1
uncovered	1
the	1
roof	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
it	1
up,	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
bed	1
wherein	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy	1
lay.	1
	1
2:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Son,	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
sitting	1
there,	1
and	1
reasoning	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
2:7	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
thus	1
speak	1
blasphemies?	1
who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins	1
but	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
immediately	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
that	1
they	1
so	1
reasoned	1
within	1
themselves,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
2:9	1
Whether	1
is	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
2:11	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
arose,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
before	1
them	1
all;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
We	1
never	1
saw	1
it	1
on	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
Levi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
sat	1
also	1
together	1
with	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
him	1
eat	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
2:17	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
used	1
to	1
fast:	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
cannot	1
fast.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
2:21	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
seweth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
garment:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
piece	1
that	1
filled	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
doth	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
is	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
will	1
be	1
marred:	1
but	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
began,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful?	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
need,	1
and	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
he,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:26	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
sabbath	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
sabbath:	1
2:28	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
there	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
withered	1
hand.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Stand	1
forth.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
kill?	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
with	1
anger,	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
out:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
Jesus	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
from	1
Galilee	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
3:8	1
And	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Idumaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
they	1
about	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
did,	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
ship	1
should	1
wait	1
on	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
throng	1
him.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
healed	1
many;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
touch	1
him,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
had	1
plagues.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
goeth	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
calleth	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
would:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
he	1
ordained	1
twelve,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
to	1
preach,	1
3:15	1
And	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
heal	1
sicknesses,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
3:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
he	1
surnamed	1
Peter;	1
3:17	1
And	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James;	1
and	1
he	1
surnamed	1
them	1
Boanerges,	1
which	1
is,	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
thunder:	1
3:18	1
And	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Thaddaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
3:19	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
cometh	1
together	1
again,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
friends	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
beside	1
himself.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
Beelzebub,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
casteth	1
he	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
How	1
can	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan?	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
kingdom	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
kingdom	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
house	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
house	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
himself,	1
and	1
be	1
divided,	1
he	1
cannot	1
stand,	1
but	1
hath	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
3:27	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
will	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
sins	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
blasphemies	1
wherewith	1
soever	1
they	1
shall	1
blaspheme:	1
3:29	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
blaspheme	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
never	1
forgiveness,	1
but	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
eternal	1
damnation.	1
	1
3:30	1
Because	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:31	1
There	1
came	1
then	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and,	1
standing	1
without,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
calling	1
him.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
without	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:33	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother,	1
or	1
my	1
brethren?	1
3:34	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
	1
3:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
teach	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
4:3	1
Hearken;	1
Behold,	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
sower	1
to	1
sow:	1
4:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
on	1
stony	1
ground,	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth;	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
sprang	1
up,	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
depth	1
of	1
earth:	1
4:6	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
it	1
was	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
it	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
yielded	1
no	1
fruit.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
did	1
yield	1
fruit	1
that	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
increased;	1
and	1
brought	1
forth,	1
some	1
thirty,	1
and	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
twelve	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
parables:	1
4:12	1
That	1
seeing	1
they	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
may	1
hear,	1
and	1
not	1
understand;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
this	1
parable?	1
and	1
how	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
parables?	1
	1
4:14	1
The	1
sower	1
soweth	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
where	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
sown;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
Satan	1
cometh	1
immediately,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
likewise	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
stony	1
ground;	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
immediately	1
receive	1
it	1
with	1
gladness;	1
4:17	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
root	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
endure	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
time:	1
afterward,	1
when	1
affliction	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
for	1
the	1
word's	1
sake,	1
immediately	1
they	1
are	1
offended.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
among	1
thorns;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
entering	1
in,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
good	1
ground;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
receive	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
thirtyfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
a	1
candle	1
brought	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
or	1
under	1
a	1
bed?	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
hid,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
manifested;	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
thing	1
kept	1
secret,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
4:23	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
ye	1
hear:	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you:	1
and	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
more	1
be	1
given.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
cast	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
ground;	1
4:27	1
And	1
should	1
sleep,	1
and	1
rise	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
spring	1
and	1
grow	1
up,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how.	1
	1
4:28	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
of	1
herself;	1
first	1
the	1
blade,	1
then	1
the	1
ear,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
ear.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fruit	1
is	1
brought	1
forth,	1
immediately	1
he	1
putteth	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
we	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
or	1
with	1
what	1
comparison	1
shall	1
we	1
compare	1
it?	1
	1
4:31	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
seeds	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:32	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown,	1
it	1
groweth	1
up,	1
and	1
becometh	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
herbs,	1
and	1
shooteth	1
out	1
great	1
branches;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
may	1
lodge	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
such	1
parables	1
spake	1
he	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
4:34	1
But	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone,	1
he	1
expounded	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
pass	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
with	1
him	1
other	1
little	1
ships.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
of	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
beat	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
full.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
asleep	1
on	1
a	1
pillow:	1
and	1
they	1
awake	1
him,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
carest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
perish?	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
Peace,	1
be	1
still.	1
And	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
4:40	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
so	1
fearful?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
faith?	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
they	1
feared	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him?	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
immediately	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
5:3	1
Who	1
had	1
his	1
dwelling	1
among	1
the	1
tombs;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
bind	1
him,	1
no,	1
not	1
with	1
chains:	1
5:4	1
Because	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
often	1
bound	1
with	1
fetters	1
and	1
chains,	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
had	1
been	1
plucked	1
asunder	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
fetters	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces:	1
neither	1
could	1
any	1
man	1
tame	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
always,	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
tombs,	1
crying,	1
and	1
cutting	1
himself	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
afar	1
off,	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
5:7	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God?	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
thou	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Legion:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
many.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
he	1
besought	1
him	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
5:11	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
mountains	1
a	1
great	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
swine,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
forthwith	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
them	1
leave.	1
And	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
(they	1
were	1
about	1
two	1
thousand;)	1
and	1
were	1
choked	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
the	1
swine	1
fled,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
legion,	1
sitting,	1
and	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
befell	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
swine.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
suffered	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
home	1
to	1
thy	1
friends,	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
hath	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
in	1
Decapolis	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
did	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
again	1
by	1
ship	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
much	1
people	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Jairus	1
by	1
name;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
5:23	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
My	1
little	1
daughter	1
lieth	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hands	1
on	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
healed;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
5:26	1
And	1
had	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
many	1
physicians,	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
and	1
was	1
nothing	1
bettered,	1
but	1
rather	1
grew	1
worse,	1
5:27	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
behind,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
5:28	1
For	1
she	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
touch	1
but	1
his	1
clothes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
was	1
dried	1
up;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
in	1
her	1
body	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
of	1
that	1
plague.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
immediately	1
knowing	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
virtue	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
turned	1
him	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
press,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
my	1
clothes?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
the	1
multitude	1
thronging	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
5:33	1
But	1
the	1
woman	1
fearing	1
and	1
trembling,	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
her,	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
be	1
whole	1
of	1
thy	1
plague.	1
	1
5:35	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead:	1
why	1
troublest	1
thou	1
the	1
Master	1
any	1
further?	1
	1
5:36	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
spoken,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
only	1
believe.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
tumult,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
wept	1
and	1
wailed	1
greatly.	1
	1
5:39	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
make	1
ye	1
this	1
ado,	1
and	1
weep?	1
the	1
damsel	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
he	1
taketh	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
entereth	1
in	1
where	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
lying.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
damsel	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Talitha	1
cumi;	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Damsel,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
arise.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
damsel	1
arose,	1
and	1
walked;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twelve	1
years.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
astonishment.	1
	1
5:43	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
straitly	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
many	1
hearing	1
him	1
were	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
From	1
whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
what	1
wisdom	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
even	1
such	1
mighty	1
works	1
are	1
wrought	1
by	1
his	1
hands?	1
	1
6:3	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
of	1
Juda,	1
and	1
Simon?	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
sisters	1
here	1
with	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
Jesus,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
kin,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
could	1
there	1
do	1
no	1
mighty	1
work,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
a	1
few	1
sick	1
folk,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
he	1
marvelled	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
villages,	1
teaching.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
by	1
two	1
and	1
two;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
over	1
unclean	1
spirits;	1
6:8	1
And	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
journey,	1
save	1
a	1
staff	1
only;	1
no	1
scrip,	1
no	1
bread,	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
purse:	1
6:9	1
But	1
be	1
shod	1
with	1
sandals;	1
and	1
not	1
put	1
on	1
two	1
coats.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
In	1
what	1
place	1
soever	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
depart	1
from	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
thence,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
preached	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
repent.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils,	1
and	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
king	1
Herod	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
(for	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
spread	1
abroad:)	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
Elias.	1
And	1
others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:16	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
John,	1
whom	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
6:17	1
For	1
Herod	1
himself	1
had	1
sent	1
forth	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
her.	1
	1
6:18	1
For	1
John	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Herod,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
thy	1
brother's	1
wife.	1
	1
6:19	1
Therefore	1
Herodias	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
him;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not:	1
6:20	1
For	1
Herod	1
feared	1
John,	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
holy,	1
and	1
observed	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
convenient	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
that	1
Herod	1
on	1
his	1
birthday	1
made	1
a	1
supper	1
to	1
his	1
lords,	1
high	1
captains,	1
and	1
chief	1
estates	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
6:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
Herodias	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
danced,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel,	1
Ask	1
of	1
me	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee,	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
mother,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
ask?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
straightway	1
with	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
asked,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
give	1
me	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
charger	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:26	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
exceeding	1
sorry;	1
yet	1
for	1
his	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
reject	1
her.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
an	1
executioner,	1
and	1
commanded	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
brought:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
beheaded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
6:28	1
And	1
brought	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
the	1
damsel	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
corpse,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
tomb.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
things,	1
both	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
taught.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
apart	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
rest	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
coming	1
and	1
going,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
by	1
ship	1
privately.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
them	1
departing,	1
and	1
many	1
knew	1
him,	1
and	1
ran	1
afoot	1
thither	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
cities,	1
and	1
outwent	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
saw	1
much	1
people,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
many	1
things.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
now	1
far	1
spent,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
far	1
passed:	1
6:36	1
Send	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
bread:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:38	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
go	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
knew,	1
they	1
say,	1
Five,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
companies	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
grass.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
ranks,	1
by	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
by	1
fifties.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes	1
divided	1
he	1
among	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:43	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fragments,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:44	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
6:45	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
before	1
unto	1
Bethsaida,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
6:47	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
6:48	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
toiling	1
in	1
rowing;	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
supposed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
spirit,	1
and	1
cried	1
out:	1
6:50	1
For	1
they	1
all	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
troubled.	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
amazed	1
in	1
themselves	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
and	1
wondered.	1
	1
6:52	1
For	1
they	1
considered	1
not	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
the	1
loaves:	1
for	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened.	1
	1
6:53	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
and	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
6:54	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
straightway	1
they	1
knew	1
him,	1
6:55	1
And	1
ran	1
through	1
that	1
whole	1
region	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
carry	1
about	1
in	1
beds	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
where	1
they	1
heard	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
6:56	1
And	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
entered,	1
into	1
villages,	1
or	1
cities,	1
or	1
country,	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
sick	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
touch	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
him	1
were	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
defiled,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
with	1
unwashen,	1
hands,	1
they	1
found	1
fault.	1
	1
7:3	1
For	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Jews,	1
except	1
they	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
oft,	1
eat	1
not,	1
holding	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
market,	1
except	1
they	1
wash,	1
they	1
eat	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
there	1
be,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
to	1
hold,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
cups,	1
and	1
pots,	1
brasen	1
vessels,	1
and	1
of	1
tables.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
asked	1
him,	1
Why	1
walk	1
not	1
thy	1
disciples	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
but	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands?	1
	1
7:6	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Well	1
hath	1
Esaias	1
prophesied	1
of	1
you	1
hypocrites,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
This	1
people	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips,	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
7:7	1
Howbeit	1
in	1
vain	1
do	1
they	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
hold	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
pots	1
and	1
cups:	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Full	1
well	1
ye	1
reject	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
keep	1
your	1
own	1
tradition.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother;	1
and,	1
Whoso	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death:	1
7:11	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
Corban,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
ye	1
suffer	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
ought	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother;	1
7:13	1
Making	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
through	1
your	1
tradition,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
delivered:	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
understand:	1
7:15	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
from	1
without	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
entering	1
into	1
him	1
can	1
defile	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
those	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
without	1
understanding	1
also?	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
perceive,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
from	1
without	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
man,	1
it	1
cannot	1
defile	1
him;	1
7:19	1
Because	1
it	1
entereth	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
goeth	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught,	1
purging	1
all	1
meats?	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
defileth	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:21	1
For	1
from	1
within,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
men,	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
murders,	1
7:22	1
Thefts,	1
covetousness,	1
wickedness,	1
deceit,	1
lasciviousness,	1
an	1
evil	1
eye,	1
blasphemy,	1
pride,	1
foolishness:	1
7:23	1
All	1
these	1
evil	1
things	1
come	1
from	1
within,	1
and	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it:	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
7:25	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
whose	1
young	1
daughter	1
had	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet:	1
7:26	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
a	1
Greek,	1
a	1
Syrophenician	1
by	1
nation;	1
and	1
she	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
devil	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Let	1
the	1
children	1
first	1
be	1
filled:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yes,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
children's	1
crumbs.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
For	1
this	1
saying	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
house,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
devil	1
gone	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
again,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Decapolis.	1
	1
7:32	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
deaf,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
impediment	1
in	1
his	1
speech;	1
and	1
they	1
beseech	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
fingers	1
into	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
he	1
spit,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
tongue;	1
7:34	1
And	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
sighed,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ephphatha,	1
that	1
is,	1
Be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
straightway	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
his	1
tongue	1
was	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
plain.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
they	1
published	1
it;	1
7:37	1
And	1
were	1
beyond	1
measure	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
done	1
all	1
things	1
well:	1
he	1
maketh	1
both	1
the	1
deaf	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
multitude	1
being	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
8:2	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
8:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
houses,	1
they	1
will	1
faint	1
by	1
the	1
way:	1
for	1
divers	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
from	1
far.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
answered	1
him,	1
From	1
whence	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
satisfy	1
these	1
men	1
with	1
bread	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
small	1
fishes:	1
and	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
also	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
four	1
thousand:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Dalmanutha.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
with	1
him,	1
seeking	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven,	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
in	1
his	1
spirit,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
generation	1
seek	1
after	1
a	1
sign?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
again	1
departed	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread,	1
neither	1
had	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
loaf.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
Herod.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
bread?	1
perceive	1
ye	1
not	1
yet,	1
neither	1
understand?	1
have	1
ye	1
your	1
heart	1
yet	1
hardened?	1
	1
8:18	1
Having	1
eyes,	1
see	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
having	1
ears,	1
hear	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember?	1
	1
8:19	1
When	1
I	1
brake	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
among	1
five	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Twelve.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
among	1
four	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand?	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
Bethsaida;	1
and	1
they	1
bring	1
a	1
blind	1
man	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
touch	1
him.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spit	1
on	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
ought.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
men	1
as	1
trees,	1
walking.	1
	1
8:25	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
again	1
upon	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
up:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
restored,	1
and	1
saw	1
every	1
man	1
clearly.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Neither	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
nor	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi:	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
And	1
Peter	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
that	1
saying	1
openly.	1
And	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him.	1
	1
8:33	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
Peter,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
also,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
8:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
8:36	1
For	1
what	1
shall	1
it	1
profit	1
a	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
	1
8:37	1
Or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
8:38	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
this	1
adulterous	1
and	1
sinful	1
generation;	1
of	1
him	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stand	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
come	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart	1
by	1
themselves:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
his	1
raiment	1
became	1
shining,	1
exceeding	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
so	1
as	1
no	1
fuller	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
white	1
them.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Elias	1
with	1
Moses:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
9:6	1
For	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
more,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only	1
with	1
themselves.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
had	1
seen,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
were	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
that	1
saying	1
with	1
themselves,	1
questioning	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
the	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
should	1
mean.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
Elias	1
verily	1
cometh	1
first,	1
and	1
restoreth	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
indeed	1
come,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
questioning	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
straightway	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
him,	1
were	1
greatly	1
amazed,	1
and	1
running	1
to	1
him	1
saluted	1
him.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
scribes,	1
What	1
question	1
ye	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
unto	1
thee	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
hath	1
a	1
dumb	1
spirit;	1
9:18	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
taketh	1
him,	1
he	1
teareth	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
foameth,	1
and	1
gnasheth	1
with	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
pineth	1
away:	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:19	1
He	1
answereth	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
O	1
faithless	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
straightway	1
the	1
spirit	1
tare	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
wallowed	1
foaming.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
father,	1
How	1
long	1
is	1
it	1
ago	1
since	1
this	1
came	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
ofttimes	1
it	1
hath	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
waters,	1
to	1
destroy	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
any	1
thing,	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
9:23	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
canst	1
believe,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
tears,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe;	1
help	1
thou	1
mine	1
unbelief.	1
	1
9:25	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
running	1
together,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
the	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
dumb	1
and	1
deaf	1
spirit,	1
I	1
charge	1
thee,	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
enter	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
cried,	1
and	1
rent	1
him	1
sore,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
one	1
dead;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
many	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
arose.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
kind	1
can	1
come	1
forth	1
by	1
nothing,	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
killed,	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum:	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
disputed	1
among	1
yourselves	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
had	1
disputed	1
among	1
themselves,	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
first,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
last	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
9:37	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
of	1
such	1
children	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me,	1
receiveth	1
not	1
me,	1
but	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us.	1
	1
9:39	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
which	1
shall	1
do	1
a	1
miracle	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
can	1
lightly	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
9:40	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
on	1
our	1
part.	1
	1
9:41	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
water	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
because	1
ye	1
belong	1
to	1
Christ,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
maimed,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:44	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:45	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
halt	1
into	1
life,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:46	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire:	1
9:48	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:49	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
every	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
salt.	1
	1
9:50	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
saltness,	1
wherewith	1
will	1
ye	1
season	1
it?	1
Have	1
salt	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
have	1
peace	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
by	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
resort	1
unto	1
him	1
again;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife?	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
did	1
Moses	1
command	1
you?	1
10:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Moses	1
suffered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
For	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
he	1
wrote	1
you	1
this	1
precept.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
God	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female.	1
	1
10:7	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife;	1
10:8	1
And	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh:	1
so	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:9	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
matter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
she	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
young	1
children	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
touch	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
those	1
that	1
brought	1
them.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
displeased,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suffer	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
running,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
10:19	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Defraud	1
not,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
observed	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
beholding	1
him	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
One	1
thing	1
thou	1
lackest:	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
sell	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
sad	1
at	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
grieved:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
words.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answereth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
how	1
hard	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
riches	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
saying	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looking	1
upon	1
them	1
saith,	1
With	1
men	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
God:	1
for	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
10:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
10:30	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
time,	1
houses,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
and	1
mothers,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
lands,	1
with	1
persecutions;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
10:31	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
first.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
amazed;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
followed,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
again	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
should	1
happen	1
unto	1
him,	1
10:33	1
Saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
10:34	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
mock	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
shall	1
desire.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
would	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
for	1
you?	1
10:37	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sit,	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
thy	1
left	1
hand,	1
in	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask:	1
can	1
ye	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of?	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
can.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
indeed	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
withal	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
baptized:	1
10:40	1
But	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
displeased	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
10:42	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
accounted	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
ones	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
10:43	1
But	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
minister:	1
10:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
chiefest,	1
shall	1
be	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
10:45	1
For	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
10:46	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jericho	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people,	1
blind	1
Bartimaeus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Timaeus,	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
highway	1
side	1
begging.	1
	1
10:47	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
out,	1
and	1
say,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
many	1
charged	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:49	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
And	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
blind	1
man,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
rise;	1
he	1
calleth	1
thee.	1
	1
10:50	1
And	1
he,	1
casting	1
away	1
his	1
garment,	1
rose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
10:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
The	1
blind	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
10:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
unto	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:2	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
entered	1
into	1
it,	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
never	1
man	1
sat;	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
this?	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
colt	1
tied	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
ways	1
met;	1
and	1
they	1
loose	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
do	1
ye,	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
colt	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
many	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
off	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna;	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
11:10	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
David,	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
eventide	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Bethany	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Bethany,	1
he	1
was	1
hungry:	1
11:13	1
And	1
seeing	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
afar	1
off	1
having	1
leaves,	1
he	1
came,	1
if	1
haply	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
any	1
thing	1
thereon:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
he	1
found	1
nothing	1
but	1
leaves;	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
figs	1
was	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
No	1
man	1
eat	1
fruit	1
of	1
thee	1
hereafter	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves;	1
11:16	1
And	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
carry	1
any	1
vessel	1
through	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer?	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
him,	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
by,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Peter	1
calling	1
to	1
remembrance	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
behold,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
which	1
thou	1
cursedst	1
is	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
faith	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
shall	1
believe	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saith	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
11:24	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
What	1
things	1
soever	1
ye	1
desire,	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
believe	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
them.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
stand	1
praying,	1
forgive,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
ought	1
against	1
any:	1
that	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
may	1
forgive	1
you	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:26	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
forgive,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
there	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
11:28	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
one	1
question,	1
and	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
11:30	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
counted	1
John,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
indeed.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
parables.	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
set	1
an	1
hedge	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
winefat,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
a	1
servant,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
another	1
servant;	1
and	1
at	1
him	1
they	1
cast	1
stones,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
shamefully	1
handled.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another;	1
and	1
him	1
they	1
killed,	1
and	1
many	1
others;	1
beating	1
some,	1
and	1
killing	1
some.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
yet	1
therefore	1
one	1
son,	1
his	1
wellbeloved,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
also	1
last	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
those	1
husbandmen	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
our's.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:9	1
What	1
shall	1
therefore	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do?	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
others.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
this	1
scripture;	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
12:11	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
the	1
parable	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
they	1
send	1
unto	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
carest	1
for	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
12:15	1
Shall	1
we	1
give,	1
or	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
give?	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
hypocrisy,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
penny,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
to	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
12:18	1
Then	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
12:19	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
a	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
and	1
leave	1
his	1
wife	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
12:20	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
dying	1
left	1
no	1
seed.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
died,	1
neither	1
left	1
he	1
any	1
seed:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
likewise.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her,	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
seed:	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
12:23	1
In	1
the	1
resurrection	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise,	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
err,	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
neither	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
12:25	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage;	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
rise:	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses,	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
bush	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
12:27	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
do	1
greatly	1
err.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
came,	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
them	1
reasoning	1
together,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
answered	1
them	1
well,	1
asked	1
him,	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
of	1
all?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
is,	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
The	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
one	1
Lord:	1
12:30	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like,	1
namely	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
commandment	1
greater	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
the	1
scribe	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
the	1
truth:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
but	1
he:	1
12:33	1
And	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
understanding,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
his	1
neighbour	1
as	1
himself,	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
whole	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
discreetly,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
that	1
durst	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
How	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:36	1
For	1
David	1
himself	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
12:37	1
David	1
therefore	1
himself	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whence	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
And	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
love	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
long	1
clothing,	1
and	1
love	1
salutations	1
in	1
the	1
marketplaces,	1
12:39	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts:	1
12:40	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
these	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
12:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
treasury,	1
and	1
beheld	1
how	1
the	1
people	1
cast	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
and	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
rich	1
cast	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow,	1
and	1
she	1
threw	1
in	1
two	1
mites,	1
which	1
make	1
a	1
farthing.	1
	1
12:43	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
more	1
in,	1
than	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
12:44	1
For	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
of	1
their	1
abundance;	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
want	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
even	1
all	1
her	1
living.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
see	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
what	1
buildings	1
are	1
here!	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
these	1
great	1
buildings?	1
	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
13:4	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
Take	1
heed	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
13:6	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars,	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
needs	1
be;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
yet.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
earthquakes	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines	1
and	1
troubles:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
13:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
councils;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
rulers	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
gospel	1
must	1
first	1
be	1
published	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
13:11	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
lead	1
you,	1
and	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
beforehand	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak,	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
premeditate:	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
hour,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
13:12	1
Now	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
betray	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
son;	1
and	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
standing	1
where	1
it	1
ought	1
not,	1
(let	1
him	1
that	1
readeth	1
understand,)	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains:	1
13:15	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
neither	1
enter	1
therein,	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
13:16	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
not	1
turn	1
back	1
again	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
13:17	1
But	1
woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter.	1
	1
13:19	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
affliction,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
which	1
God	1
created	1
unto	1
this	1
time,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shortened	1
those	1
days,	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
he	1
hath	1
shortened	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ;	1
or,	1
lo,	1
he	1
is	1
there;	1
believe	1
him	1
not:	1
13:22	1
For	1
false	1
Christs	1
and	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
to	1
seduce,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
even	1
the	1
elect.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
take	1
ye	1
heed:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
foretold	1
you	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:24	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
after	1
that	1
tribulation,	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
send	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
her	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
near:	1
13:29	1
So	1
ye	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nigh,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
13:30	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
13:31	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
13:32	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
13:33	1
Take	1
ye	1
heed,	1
watch	1
and	1
pray:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
is.	1
	1
13:34	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
Man	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taking	1
a	1
far	1
journey,	1
who	1
left	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
authority	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
porter	1
to	1
watch.	1
	1
13:35	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
cometh,	1
at	1
even,	1
or	1
at	1
midnight,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
cockcrowing,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
13:36	1
Lest	1
coming	1
suddenly	1
he	1
find	1
you	1
sleeping.	1
	1
13:37	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
all,	1
Watch.	1
	1
14:1	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
was	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
craft,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
Bethany	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard	1
very	1
precious;	1
and	1
she	1
brake	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
that	1
had	1
indignation	1
within	1
themselves,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
was	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
the	1
ointment	1
made?	1
	1
14:5	1
For	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
And	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone;	1
why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
her?	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
with	1
you	1
always,	1
and	1
whensoever	1
ye	1
will	1
ye	1
may	1
do	1
them	1
good:	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
14:8	1
She	1
hath	1
done	1
what	1
she	1
could:	1
she	1
is	1
come	1
aforehand	1
to	1
anoint	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
burying.	1
	1
14:9	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
this	1
also	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
conveniently	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover,	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
a	1
man	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water:	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
in,	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished	1
and	1
prepared:	1
there	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
One	1
of	1
you	1
which	1
eateth	1
with	1
me	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
and	1
another	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
that	1
dippeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish.	1
	1
14:21	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
indeed	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
good	1
were	1
it	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
drank	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
14:25	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
risen,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
14:29	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Although	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
yet	1
will	1
not	1
I.	1
	1
14:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
day,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
the	1
more	1
vehemently,	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deny	1
thee	1
in	1
any	1
wise.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
they	1
all.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
named	1
Gethsemane:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
shall	1
pray.	1
	1
14:33	1
And	1
he	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sore	1
amazed,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
heavy;	1
14:34	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
prayed	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
the	1
hour	1
might	1
pass	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Abba,	1
Father,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
unto	1
thee;	1
take	1
away	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
14:37	1
And	1
he	1
cometh,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
sleepest	1
thou?	1
couldest	1
not	1
thou	1
watch	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
14:38	1
Watch	1
ye	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
The	1
spirit	1
truly	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
14:39	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
spake	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
14:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
returned,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again,	1
(for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy,)	1
neither	1
wist	1
they	1
what	1
to	1
answer	1
him.	1
	1
14:41	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
it	1
is	1
enough,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
behold,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
14:42	1
Rise	1
up,	1
let	1
us	1
go;	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
14:43	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
cometh	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
14:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
token,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he;	1
take	1
him,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
safely.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
goeth	1
straightway	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
14:46	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
14:47	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
drew	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
smote	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
14:48	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
staves	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
	1
14:49	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
teaching,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
scriptures	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:50	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
14:51	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man,	1
having	1
a	1
linen	1
cloth	1
cast	1
about	1
his	1
naked	1
body;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
14:52	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
them	1
naked.	1
	1
14:53	1
And	1
they	1
led	1
Jesus	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
14:54	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
14:55	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council	1
sought	1
for	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
14:56	1
For	1
many	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
but	1
their	1
witness	1
agreed	1
not	1
together.	1
	1
14:57	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
certain,	1
and	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
saying,	1
14:58	1
We	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
temple	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
and	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
another	1
made	1
without	1
hands.	1
	1
14:59	1
But	1
neither	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
witness	1
agree	1
together.	1
	1
14:60	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
asked	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
14:61	1
But	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
Again	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Blessed?	1
	1
14:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
14:63	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
saith,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witnesses?	1
	1
14:64	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
blasphemy:	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
condemned	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
14:65	1
And	1
some	1
began	1
to	1
spit	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
to	1
buffet	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Prophesy:	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
did	1
strike	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:66	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
beneath	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
14:67	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter	1
warming	1
himself,	1
she	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
And	1
thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
14:68	1
But	1
he	1
denied,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
understand	1
I	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch;	1
and	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
14:69	1
And	1
a	1
maid	1
saw	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:70	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
it	1
again.	1
And	1
a	1
little	1
after,	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Galilaean,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
agreeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
14:71	1
But	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
speak.	1
	1
14:72	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
And	1
Peter	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
thereon,	1
he	1
wept.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
straightway	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
held	1
a	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
council,	1
and	1
bound	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
Jesus	1
yet	1
answered	1
nothing;	1
so	1
that	1
Pilate	1
marvelled.	1
	1
15:6	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
one	1
prisoner,	1
whomsoever	1
they	1
desired.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
named	1
Barabbas,	1
which	1
lay	1
bound	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
him,	1
who	1
had	1
committed	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
insurrection.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
crying	1
aloud	1
began	1
to	1
desire	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:10	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
had	1
delivered	1
him	1
for	1
envy.	1
	1
15:11	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
moved	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rather	1
release	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
again,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:14	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more	1
exceedingly,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
so	1
Pilate,	1
willing	1
to	1
content	1
the	1
people,	1
released	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
called	1
Praetorium;	1
and	1
they	1
call	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
band.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
they	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
purple,	1
and	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
15:18	1
And	1
began	1
to	1
salute	1
him,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
15:19	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
did	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
bowing	1
their	1
knees	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
purple	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
clothes	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
they	1
compel	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
who	1
passed	1
by,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Rufus,	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
Golgotha,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink	1
wine	1
mingled	1
with	1
myrrh:	1
but	1
he	1
received	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
him,	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots	1
upon	1
them,	1
what	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
take.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
they	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
the	1
superscription	1
of	1
his	1
accusation	1
was	1
written	1
over,	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
crucify	1
two	1
thieves;	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Ah,	1
thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
15:30	1
Save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
15:31	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
said	1
among	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
scribes,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
	1
15:32	1
Let	1
Christ	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
descend	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
and	1
believe.	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him	1
reviled	1
him.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eloi,	1
Eloi,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
calleth	1
Elias.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
one	1
ran	1
and	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
alone;	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
down.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
which	1
stood	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
he	1
said,	1
Truly	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
women	1
looking	1
on	1
afar	1
off:	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
the	1
less	1
and	1
of	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Salome;	1
15:41	1
(Who	1
also,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him;)	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
women	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:42	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
15:43	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
an	1
honourable	1
counsellor,	1
which	1
also	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
came,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
boldly	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
craved	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
15:44	1
And	1
Pilate	1
marvelled	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
dead:	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
while	1
dead.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
Joseph.	1
	1
15:46	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
which	1
was	1
hewn	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
rolled	1
a	1
stone	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
15:47	1
And	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Joses	1
beheld	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
was	1
past,	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Salome,	1
had	1
bought	1
sweet	1
spices,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
and	1
anoint	1
him.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
at	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
shall	1
roll	1
us	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre?	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
looked,	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
rolled	1
away:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
great.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
clothed	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
white	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
affrighted.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
affrighted:	1
Ye	1
seek	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified:	1
he	1
is	1
risen;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
behold	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
Peter	1
that	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
quickly,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
for	1
they	1
trembled	1
and	1
were	1
amazed:	1
neither	1
said	1
they	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
any	1
man;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
16:9	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
risen	1
early	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
he	1
appeared	1
first	1
to	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
seven	1
devils.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
they	1
mourned	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
her,	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
16:12	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
another	1
form	1
unto	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
walked,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
residue:	1
neither	1
believed	1
they	1
them.	1
	1
16:14	1
Afterward	1
he	1
appeared	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
and	1
upbraided	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
unbelief	1
and	1
hardness	1
of	1
heart,	1
because	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
risen.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
every	1
creature.	1
	1
16:16	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
damned.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
these	1
signs	1
shall	1
follow	1
them	1
that	1
believe;	1
In	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
devils;	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
new	1
tongues;	1
16:18	1
They	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
serpents;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
drink	1
any	1
deadly	1
thing,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
recover.	1
	1
16:19	1
So	1
then	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
preached	1
every	1
where,	1
the	1
Lord	1
working	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
confirming	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
signs	1
following.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Luke	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
many	1
have	1
taken	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
order	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
most	1
surely	1
believed	1
among	1
us,	1
1:2	1
Even	1
as	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
were	1
eyewitnesses,	1
and	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
word;	1
1:3	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
also,	1
having	1
had	1
perfect	1
understanding	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first,	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
order,	1
most	1
excellent	1
Theophilus,	1
1:4	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
those	1
things,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
instructed.	1
	1
1:5	1
THERE	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
named	1
Zacharias,	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Abia:	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
righteous	1
before	1
God,	1
walking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
blameless.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
child,	1
because	1
that	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
barren,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
were	1
now	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
course,	1
1:9	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
priest's	1
office,	1
his	1
lot	1
was	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
praying	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
when	1
Zacharias	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Zacharias:	1
for	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard;	1
and	1
thy	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
John.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness;	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
shall	1
drink	1
neither	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
Elias,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
disobedient	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
just;	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
a	1
people	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
Zacharias	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
Whereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
this?	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
Gabriel,	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
shew	1
thee	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings.	1
	1
1:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
dumb,	1
and	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
speak,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
performed,	1
because	1
thou	1
believest	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
their	1
season.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
waited	1
for	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
for	1
he	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
remained	1
speechless.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
ministration	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
he	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
his	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
conceived,	1
and	1
hid	1
herself	1
five	1
months,	1
saying,	1
1:25	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
dealt	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
wherein	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
me,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
reproach	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
the	1
angel	1
Gabriel	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
unto	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
named	1
Nazareth,	1
1:27	1
To	1
a	1
virgin	1
espoused	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Joseph,	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
virgin's	1
name	1
was	1
Mary.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
highly	1
favoured,	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
was	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
saying,	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
salutation	1
this	1
should	1
be.	1
	1
1:30	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Mary:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
favour	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:31	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive	1
in	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
1:32	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
David:	1
1:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
1:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Mary	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
How	1
shall	1
this	1
be,	1
seeing	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
a	1
man?	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
shall	1
overshadow	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
also	1
that	1
holy	1
thing	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:36	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
cousin	1
Elisabeth,	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
conceived	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
her	1
old	1
age:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
with	1
her,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
barren.	1
	1
1:37	1
For	1
with	1
God	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
handmaid	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
Mary	1
arose	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
with	1
haste,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Juda;	1
1:40	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
saluted	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Elisabeth	1
heard	1
the	1
salutation	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
her	1
womb;	1
and	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
1:42	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women,	1
and	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
womb.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
whence	1
is	1
this	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
my	1
Lord	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
1:44	1
For,	1
lo,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
salutation	1
sounded	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
my	1
womb	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
1:45	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
she	1
that	1
believed:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
My	1
soul	1
doth	1
magnify	1
the	1
Lord,	1
1:47	1
And	1
my	1
spirit	1
hath	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
God	1
my	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:48	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
regarded	1
the	1
low	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
handmaiden:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
from	1
henceforth	1
all	1
generations	1
shall	1
call	1
me	1
blessed.	1
	1
1:49	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
mighty	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
me	1
great	1
things;	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
1:50	1
And	1
his	1
mercy	1
is	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
1:51	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
strength	1
with	1
his	1
arm;	1
he	1
hath	1
scattered	1
the	1
proud	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:52	1
He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
exalted	1
them	1
of	1
low	1
degree.	1
	1
1:53	1
He	1
hath	1
filled	1
the	1
hungry	1
with	1
good	1
things;	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
empty	1
away.	1
	1
1:54	1
He	1
hath	1
holpen	1
his	1
servant	1
Israel,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
mercy;	1
1:55	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:56	1
And	1
Mary	1
abode	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:57	1
Now	1
Elisabeth's	1
full	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered;	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:58	1
And	1
her	1
neighbours	1
and	1
her	1
cousins	1
heard	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shewed	1
great	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
1:59	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
circumcise	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
him	1
Zacharias,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
1:60	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Not	1
so;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
John.	1
	1
1:61	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
1:62	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
called.	1
	1
1:63	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
wrote,	1
saying,	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
John.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
all.	1
	1
1:64	1
And	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
opened	1
immediately,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
praised	1
God.	1
	1
1:65	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
were	1
noised	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
of	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:66	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
them	1
laid	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
child	1
shall	1
this	1
be!	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
1:67	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
Zacharias	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
prophesied,	1
saying,	1
1:68	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
visited	1
and	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people,	1
1:69	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
an	1
horn	1
of	1
salvation	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
David;	1
1:70	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began:	1
1:71	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
hate	1
us;	1
1:72	1
To	1
perform	1
the	1
mercy	1
promised	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
his	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
1:73	1
The	1
oath	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
1:74	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
being	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
might	1
serve	1
him	1
without	1
fear,	1
1:75	1
In	1
holiness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
before	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
life.	1
	1
1:76	1
And	1
thou,	1
child,	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
prepare	1
his	1
ways;	1
1:77	1
To	1
give	1
knowledge	1
of	1
salvation	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins,	1
1:78	1
Through	1
the	1
tender	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
whereby	1
the	1
dayspring	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
hath	1
visited	1
us,	1
1:79	1
To	1
give	1
light	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
to	1
guide	1
our	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
1:80	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
deserts	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
shewing	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
decree	1
from	1
Caesar	1
Augustus	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
be	1
taxed.	1
	1
2:2	1
(And	1
this	1
taxing	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
when	1
Cyrenius	1
was	1
governor	1
of	1
Syria.)	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
all	1
went	1
to	1
be	1
taxed,	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Bethlehem;	1
(because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
lineage	1
of	1
David:)	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
taxed	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
espoused	1
wife,	1
being	1
great	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
there,	1
the	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
manger;	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
shepherds	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
keeping	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
flock	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
2:9	1
And,	1
lo,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shone	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
is	1
born	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
you;	1
Ye	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
babe	1
wrapped	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
host	1
praising	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
2:14	1
Glory	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
highest,	1
and	1
on	1
earth	1
peace,	1
good	1
will	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
into	1
heaven,	1
the	1
shepherds	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
go	1
even	1
unto	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
haste,	1
and	1
found	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
the	1
babe	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
they	1
made	1
known	1
abroad	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
them	1
concerning	1
this	1
child.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
wondered	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
shepherds.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
Mary	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
pondered	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
returned,	1
glorifying	1
and	1
praising	1
God	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
when	1
eight	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
for	1
the	1
circumcising	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
JESUS,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
named	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
conceived	1
in	1
the	1
womb.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purification	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
2:23	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Every	1
male	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
holy	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;)	1
2:24	1
And	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
A	1
pair	1
of	1
turtledoves,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons.	1
	1
2:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Simeon;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
devout,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord's	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
parents	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
2:28	1
Then	1
took	1
he	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
blessed	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
2:29	1
Lord,	1
now	1
lettest	1
thou	1
thy	1
servant	1
depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
2:30	1
For	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
2:31	1
Which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
people;	1
2:32	1
A	1
light	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
marvelled	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
Simeon	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
child	1
is	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
fall	1
and	1
rising	1
again	1
of	1
many	1
in	1
Israel;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
against;	1
2:35	1
(Yea,	1
a	1
sword	1
shall	1
pierce	1
through	1
thy	1
own	1
soul	1
also,)	1
that	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
many	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Anna,	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Phanuel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Aser:	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
age,	1
and	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
an	1
husband	1
seven	1
years	1
from	1
her	1
virginity;	1
2:37	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
of	1
about	1
fourscore	1
and	1
four	1
years,	1
which	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
but	1
served	1
God	1
with	1
fastings	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
she	1
coming	1
in	1
that	1
instant	1
gave	1
thanks	1
likewise	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
looked	1
for	1
redemption	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
performed	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
city	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:41	1
Now	1
his	1
parents	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
every	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
days,	1
as	1
they	1
returned,	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus	1
tarried	1
behind	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
not	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:44	1
But	1
they,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
went	1
a	1
day's	1
journey;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
him	1
among	1
their	1
kinsfolk	1
and	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
2:45	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
seeking	1
him.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
doctors,	1
both	1
hearing	1
them,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
questions.	1
	1
2:47	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
understanding	1
and	1
answers.	1
	1
2:48	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
amazed:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
thus	1
dealt	1
with	1
us?	1
behold,	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
thee	1
sorrowing.	1
	1
2:49	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
sought	1
me?	1
wist	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
my	1
Father's	1
business?	1
	1
2:50	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
and	1
was	1
subject	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
his	1
mother	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
increased	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
stature,	1
and	1
in	1
favour	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Tiberius	1
Caesar,	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Herod	1
being	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Ituraea	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Trachonitis,	1
and	1
Lysanias	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Abilene,	1
3:2	1
Annas	1
and	1
Caiaphas	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priests,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
John	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
preaching	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins;	1
3:4	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:5	1
Every	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
filled,	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
hill	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low;	1
and	1
the	1
crooked	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
smooth;	1
3:6	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
worthy	1
of	1
repentance,	1
and	1
begin	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
every	1
tree	1
therefore	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
then?	1
	1
3:11	1
He	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
two	1
coats,	1
let	1
him	1
impart	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
none;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
meat,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
likewise.	1
	1
3:12	1
Then	1
came	1
also	1
publicans	1
to	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Exact	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
appointed	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
likewise	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
violence	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
accuse	1
any	1
falsely;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
your	1
wages.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
expectation,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
mused	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
of	1
John,	1
whether	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
Christ,	1
or	1
not;	1
3:16	1
John	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
cometh,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:17	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
his	1
garner;	1
but	1
the	1
chaff	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
unquenchable.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
exhortation	1
preached	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
being	1
reproved	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
Herodias	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
Herod	1
had	1
done,	1
3:20	1
Added	1
yet	1
this	1
above	1
all,	1
that	1
he	1
shut	1
up	1
John	1
in	1
prison.	1
	1
3:21	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
baptized,	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
also	1
being	1
baptized,	1
and	1
praying,	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened,	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
descended	1
in	1
a	1
bodily	1
shape	1
like	1
a	1
dove	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
from	1
heaven,	1
which	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son;	1
in	1
thee	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
being	1
(as	1
was	1

	1
4:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
returned	1
from	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
forty	1
days	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
nothing:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ended,	1
he	1
afterward	1
hungered.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
this	1
stone	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
devil,	1
taking	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain,	1
shewed	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
this	1
power	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it.	1
	1
4:7	1
If	1
thou	1
therefore	1
wilt	1
worship	1
me,	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
thine.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down	1
from	1
hence:	1
4:10	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
over	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee:	1
4:11	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
the	1
temptation,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
being	1
glorified	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up:	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
custom	1
was,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
to	1
read.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
delivered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
book,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
4:18	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
anointed	1
me	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
brokenhearted,	1
to	1
preach	1
deliverance	1
to	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
recovering	1
of	1
sight	1
to	1
the	1
blind,	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bruised,	1
4:19	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
acceptable	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
minister,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
were	1
fastened	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
this	1
scripture	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
all	1
bare	1
him	1
witness,	1
and	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
gracious	1
words	1
which	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Joseph's	1
son?	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
will	1
surely	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
proverb,	1
Physician,	1
heal	1
thyself:	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
done	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
do	1
also	1
here	1
in	1
thy	1
country.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
No	1
prophet	1
is	1
accepted	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:25	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
many	1
widows	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Elias,	1
when	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
when	1
great	1
famine	1
was	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
4:26	1
But	1
unto	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
Elias	1
sent,	1
save	1
unto	1
Sarepta,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Sidon,	1
unto	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
widow.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
many	1
lepers	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Eliseus	1
the	1
prophet;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
cleansed,	1
saving	1
Naaman	1
the	1
Syrian.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wrath,	1
4:29	1
And	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
thrust	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
whereon	1
their	1
city	1
was	1
built,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
headlong.	1
	1
4:30	1
But	1
he	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
4:31	1
And	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
devil,	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
4:34	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
thrown	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
hurt	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
a	1
word	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
power	1
he	1
commandeth	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
every	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Simon's	1
house.	1
	1
And	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
fever;	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
her,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
fever;	1
and	1
it	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:40	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
setting,	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
any	1
sick	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
devils	1
also	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many,	1
crying	1
out,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
he	1
rebuking	1
them	1
suffered	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:42	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
stayed	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
4:43	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
must	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
other	1
cities	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
sent.	1
	1
4:44	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
5:2	1
And	1
saw	1
two	1
ships	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
lake:	1
but	1
the	1
fishermen	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
were	1
washing	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
was	1
Simon's,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
thrust	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
land.	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
5:4	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
speaking,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Launch	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
your	1
nets	1
for	1
a	1
draught.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Simon	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
have	1
toiled	1
all	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing:	1
nevertheless	1
at	1
thy	1
word	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
net.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
this	1
done,	1
they	1
inclosed	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes:	1
and	1
their	1
net	1
brake.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
they	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
their	1
partners,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
ship,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
filled	1
both	1
the	1
ships,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
sink.	1
	1
5:8	1
When	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
knees,	1
saying,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sinful	1
man,	1
O	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
astonished,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken:	1
5:10	1
And	1
so	1
was	1
also	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
which	1
were	1
partners	1
with	1
Simon.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
catch	1
men.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
ships	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
forsook	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
city,	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
leprosy:	1
who	1
seeing	1
Jesus	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will:	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
go,	1
and	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing,	1
according	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
went	1
there	1
a	1
fame	1
abroad	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
by	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
doctors	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
sitting	1
by,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
town	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
present	1
to	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
5:18	1
And,	1
behold,	1
men	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
palsy:	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
means	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
him	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
by	1
what	1
way	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
him	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
went	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
tiling	1
with	1
his	1
couch	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
before	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
reason,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
speaketh	1
blasphemies?	1
Who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
but	1
God	1
alone?	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
reason	1
ye	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
5:23	1
Whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
upon	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
couch,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
that	1
whereon	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
glorifying	1
God.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
fear,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
publican,	1
named	1
Levi,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
all,	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
Levi	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
of	1
others	1
that	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:30	1
But	1
their	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
murmured	1
against	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
5:32	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
5:33	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
fast	1
often,	1
and	1
make	1
prayers,	1
and	1
likewise	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees;	1
but	1
thine	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
5:35	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
5:36	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them;	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
garment	1
upon	1
an	1
old;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
then	1
both	1
the	1
new	1
maketh	1
a	1
rent,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
that	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
agreeth	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
old.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles;	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
will	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
be	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
5:38	1
But	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles;	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
5:39	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
having	1
drunk	1
old	1
wine	1
straightway	1
desireth	1
new:	1
for	1
he	1
saith,	1
The	1
old	1
is	1
better.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
sabbath	1
after	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
plucked	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
rubbing	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
said,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this,	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
himself	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
6:4	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
alone?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
That	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
on	1
another	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
and	1
taught:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
withered.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
an	1
accusation	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
and	1
stand	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
forth.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
looking	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
them	1
all,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
madness;	1
and	1
communed	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
continued	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
prayer	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
chose	1
twelve,	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
named	1
apostles;	1
6:14	1
Simon,	1
(whom	1
he	1
also	1
named	1
Peter,)	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
Philip	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
6:15	1
Matthew	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
called	1
Zelotes,	1
6:16	1
And	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
traitor.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
their	1
diseases;	1
6:18	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
sought	1
to	1
touch	1
him:	1
for	1
there	1
went	1
virtue	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
poor:	1
for	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:21	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
hunger	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
weep	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
laugh.	1
	1
6:22	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
separate	1
you	1
from	1
their	1
company,	1
and	1
shall	1
reproach	1
you,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
your	1
name	1
as	1
evil,	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man's	1
sake.	1
	1
6:23	1
Rejoice	1
ye	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
leap	1
for	1
joy:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
your	1
reward	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
manner	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:24	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
rich!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
your	1
consolation.	1
	1
6:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
full!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
hunger.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
laugh	1
now!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
mourn	1
and	1
weep.	1
	1
6:26	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
you!	1
for	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
false	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:27	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
hear,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
hate	1
you,	1
6:28	1
Bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
cheek	1
offer	1
also	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
cloak	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
thy	1
coat	1
also.	1
	1
6:30	1
Give	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
goods	1
ask	1
them	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
6:32	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
love	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
them.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
do	1
even	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
lend	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
hope	1
to	1
receive,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
lend	1
to	1
sinners,	1
to	1
receive	1
as	1
much	1
again.	1
	1
6:35	1
But	1
love	1
ye	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
lend,	1
hoping	1
for	1
nothing	1
again;	1
and	1
your	1
reward	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
kind	1
unto	1
the	1
unthankful	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
6:36	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
merciful,	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
is	1
merciful.	1
	1
6:37	1
Judge	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
judged:	1
condemn	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
condemned:	1
forgive,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven:	1
6:38	1
Give,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you;	1
good	1
measure,	1
pressed	1
down,	1
and	1
shaken	1
together,	1
and	1
running	1
over,	1
shall	1
men	1
give	1
into	1
your	1
bosom.	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
measure	1
that	1
ye	1
mete	1
withal	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind?	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
both	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch?	1
	1
6:40	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master:	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
perfect	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
perceivest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
6:42	1
Either	1
how	1
canst	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Brother,	1
let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
eye,	1
when	1
thou	1
thyself	1
beholdest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
cast	1
out	1
first	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye,	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
6:43	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
corrupt	1
fruit;	1
neither	1
doth	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
6:44	1
For	1
every	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
fruit.	1
For	1
of	1
thorns	1
men	1
do	1
not	1
gather	1
figs,	1
nor	1
of	1
a	1
bramble	1
bush	1
gather	1
they	1
grapes.	1
	1
6:45	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil:	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
his	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
why	1
call	1
ye	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
say?	1
	1
6:47	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
heareth	1
my	1
sayings,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
like:	1
6:48	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
built	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
digged	1
deep,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
a	1
rock:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
flood	1
arose,	1
the	1
stream	1
beat	1
vehemently	1
upon	1
that	1
house,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
it:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
heareth,	1
and	1
doeth	1
not,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
without	1
a	1
foundation	1
built	1
an	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
stream	1
did	1
beat	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
fell;	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
his	1
sayings	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
centurion's	1
servant,	1
who	1
was	1
dear	1
unto	1
him,	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
beseeching	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
instantly,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
worthy	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
this:	1
7:5	1
For	1
he	1
loveth	1
our	1
nation,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
us	1
a	1
synagogue.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
centurion	1
sent	1
friends	1
to	1
him,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
trouble	1
not	1
thyself:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
enter	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
7:7	1
Wherefore	1
neither	1
thought	1
I	1
myself	1
worthy	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
set	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
under	1
me	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
one,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
followed	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
found	1
the	1
servant	1
whole	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nain;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
much	1
people.	1
	1
7:12	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
carried	1
out,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Weep	1
not.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
bier:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
him	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Young	1
man,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
sat	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
fear	1
on	1
all:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
That	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
among	1
us;	1
and,	1
That	1
God	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
this	1
rumour	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
shewed	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
John	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
7:20	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
said,	1
John	1
Baptist	1
hath	1
sent	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
he	1
cured	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities	1
and	1
plagues,	1
and	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits;	1
and	1
unto	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
blind	1
he	1
gave	1
sight.	1
	1
7:22	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way,	1
and	1
tell	1
John	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard;	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
see,	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
John	1
were	1
departed,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
7:25	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
Behold,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
gorgeously	1
apparelled,	1
and	1
live	1
delicately,	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
courts.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
Yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:27	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
greater	1
prophet	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
publicans,	1
justified	1
God,	1
being	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
7:30	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
lawyers	1
rejected	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God	1
against	1
themselves,	1
being	1
not	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation?	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
like?	1
	1
7:32	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
and	1
calling	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
wept.	1
	1
7:33	1
For	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
bread	1
nor	1
drinking	1
wine;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
7:34	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
gluttonous	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners!	1
7:35	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
eat	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
7:37	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
sinner,	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
brought	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment,	1
7:38	1
And	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
behind	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
anointed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:39	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
which	1
had	1
bidden	1
him	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
spake	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
prophet,	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
woman	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
toucheth	1
him:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
7:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Simon,	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
7:41	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
creditor	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
debtors:	1
the	1
one	1
owed	1
five	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
fifty.	1
	1
7:42	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
pay,	1
he	1
frankly	1
forgave	1
them	1
both.	1
Tell	1
me	1
therefore,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
love	1
him	1
most?	1
	1
7:43	1
Simon	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
he,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
forgave	1
most.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
rightly	1
judged.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
this	1
woman?	1
I	1
entered	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
my	1
feet:	1
but	1
she	1
hath	1
washed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
wiped	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
7:45	1
Thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
kiss:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
hath	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
kiss	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
7:46	1
My	1
head	1
with	1
oil	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
anoint:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
anointed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:47	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Her	1
sins,	1
which	1
are	1
many,	1
are	1
forgiven;	1
for	1
she	1
loved	1
much:	1
but	1
to	1
whom	1
little	1
is	1
forgiven,	1
the	1
same	1
loveth	1
little.	1
	1
7:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven.	1
	1
7:49	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
forgiveth	1
sins	1
also?	1
	1
7:50	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
Thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
throughout	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
village,	1
preaching	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
8:2	1
And	1
certain	1
women,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
healed	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits	1
and	1
infirmities,	1
Mary	1
called	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
went	1
seven	1
devils,	1
8:3	1
And	1
Joanna	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Chuza	1
Herod's	1
steward,	1
and	1
Susanna,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
which	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
substance.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
when	1
much	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
a	1
parable:	1
8:5	1
A	1
sower	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
sow	1
his	1
seed:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
trodden	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
devoured	1
it.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
upon	1
a	1
rock;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
it	1
withered	1
away,	1
because	1
it	1
lacked	1
moisture.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprang	1
up	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
choked	1
it.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
bare	1
fruit	1
an	1
hundredfold.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
cried,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
might	1
this	1
parable	1
be?	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
to	1
others	1
in	1
parables;	1
that	1
seeing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
the	1
parable	1
is	1
this:	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:12	1
Those	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear;	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
and	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
hear,	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
joy;	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
no	1
root,	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
believe,	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
temptation	1
fall	1
away.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
are	1
choked	1
with	1
cares	1
and	1
riches	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
bring	1
no	1
fruit	1
to	1
perfection.	1
	1
8:15	1
But	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
are	1
they,	1
which	1
in	1
an	1
honest	1
and	1
good	1
heart,	1
having	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
with	1
patience.	1
	1
8:16	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
covereth	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
vessel,	1
or	1
putteth	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bed;	1
but	1
setteth	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
enter	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
nothing	1
is	1
secret,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
manifest;	1
neither	1
any	1
thing	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
8:18	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
how	1
ye	1
hear:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seemeth	1
to	1
have.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake.	1
And	1
they	1
launched	1
forth.	1
	1
8:23	1
But	1
as	1
they	1
sailed	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep:	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
wind	1
on	1
the	1
lake;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
jeopardy.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
master,	1
we	1
perish.	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
raging	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
they	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
calm.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
faith?	1
And	1
they	1
being	1
afraid	1
wondered,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
he	1
commandeth	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
they	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes,	1
which	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Galilee.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
land,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
devils	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
ware	1
no	1
clothes,	1
neither	1
abode	1
in	1
any	1
house,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
tombs.	1
	1
8:28	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
most	1
high?	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:29	1
(For	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
For	1
oftentimes	1
it	1
had	1
caught	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
kept	1
bound	1
with	1
chains	1
and	1
in	1
fetters;	1
and	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
bands,	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.)	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Legion:	1
because	1
many	1
devils	1
were	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding	1
on	1
the	1
mountain:	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
them.	1
	1
8:33	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
devils	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
lake,	1
and	1
were	1
choked.	1
	1
8:34	1
When	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
them	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
done;	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
man,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
8:36	1
They	1
also	1
which	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
8:37	1
Then	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes	1
round	1
about	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
great	1
fear:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
returned	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
8:38	1
Now	1
the	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
8:39	1
Return	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
shew	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
published	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
8:40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
returned,	1
the	1
people	1
gladly	1
received	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
8:41	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Jairus,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
house:	1
8:42	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
only	1
daughter,	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
a	1
dying.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
people	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
8:43	1
And	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
which	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
her	1
living	1
upon	1
physicians,	1
neither	1
could	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
any,	1
8:44	1
Came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
immediately	1
her	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
stanched.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
When	1
all	1
denied,	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
said,	1
Master,	1
the	1
multitude	1
throng	1
thee	1
and	1
press	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
8:46	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Somebody	1
hath	1
touched	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
virtue	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:47	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
hid,	1
she	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
falling	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
she	1
declared	1
unto	1
him	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
what	1
cause	1
she	1
had	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
immediately.	1
	1
8:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:49	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house,	1
saying	1
to	1
him,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead;	1
trouble	1
not	1
the	1
Master.	1
	1
8:50	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
believe	1
only,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
8:51	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
go	1
in,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
maiden.	1
	1
8:52	1
And	1
all	1
wept,	1
and	1
bewailed	1
her:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
Weep	1
not;	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
8:53	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn,	1
knowing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
8:54	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
called,	1
saying,	1
Maid,	1
arise.	1
	1
8:55	1
And	1
her	1
spirit	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
arose	1
straightway:	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
meat.	1
	1
8:56	1
And	1
her	1
parents	1
were	1
astonished:	1
but	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
together,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
all	1
devils,	1
and	1
to	1
cure	1
diseases.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
sick.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
nothing	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
staves,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
neither	1
bread,	1
neither	1
money;	1
neither	1
have	1
two	1
coats	1
apiece.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter	1
into,	1
there	1
abide,	1
and	1
thence	1
depart.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
from	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
they	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
towns,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
where.	1
	1
9:7	1
Now	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
9:8	1
And	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
Elias	1
had	1
appeared;	1
and	1
of	1
others,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
was	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
Herod	1
said,	1
John	1
have	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
but	1
who	1
is	1
this,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
hear	1
such	1
things?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
apostles,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
returned,	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
aside	1
privately	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
called	1
Bethsaida.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
it,	1
followed	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
need	1
of	1
healing.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
wear	1
away,	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
lodge,	1
and	1
get	1
victuals:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
place.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
two	1
fishes;	1
except	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
meat	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Make	1
them	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
fifties	1
in	1
a	1
company.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
all	1
sit	1
down.	1
	1
9:16	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
filled:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
of	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
them	1
twelve	1
baskets.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
praying,	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
say	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
9:19	1
They	1
answering	1
said,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others	1
say,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
is	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:20	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
Peter	1
answering	1
said,	1
The	1
Christ	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thing;	1
9:22	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
slain,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross	1
daily,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
9:25	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
advantaged,	1
if	1
he	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
himself,	1
or	1
be	1
cast	1
away?	1
	1
9:26	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
glory,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
Father's,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
an	1
eight	1
days	1
after	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
took	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
prayed,	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
altered,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
glistering.	1
	1
9:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias:	1
9:31	1
Who	1
appeared	1
in	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
decease	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
accomplish	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
heavy	1
with	1
sleep:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
awake,	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
stood	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias:	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
9:34	1
While	1
he	1
thus	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
past,	1
Jesus	1
was	1
found	1
alone.	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
it	1
close,	1
and	1
told	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hill,	1
much	1
people	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
9:38	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
look	1
upon	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mine	1
only	1
child.	1
	1
9:39	1
And,	1
lo,	1
a	1
spirit	1
taketh	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
crieth	1
out;	1
and	1
it	1
teareth	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
foameth	1
again,	1
and	1
bruising	1
him	1
hardly	1
departeth	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
I	1
besought	1
thy	1
disciples	1
to	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
suffer	1
you?	1
Bring	1
thy	1
son	1
hither.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
coming,	1
the	1
devil	1
threw	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
tare	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
and	1
healed	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
mighty	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
But	1
while	1
they	1
wondered	1
every	1
one	1
at	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
9:44	1
Let	1
these	1
sayings	1
sink	1
down	1
into	1
your	1
ears:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:45	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
perceived	1
it	1
not:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
saying.	1
	1
9:46	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
reasoning	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
perceiving	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
by	1
him,	1
9:48	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
this	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
among	1
you	1
all,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
great.	1
	1
9:49	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name;	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
9:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
received	1
up,	1
he	1
stedfastly	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
9:52	1
And	1
sent	1
messengers	1
before	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans,	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
9:53	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:54	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
saw	1
this,	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
command	1
fire	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consume	1
them,	1
even	1
as	1
Elias	1
did?	1
	1
9:55	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
spirit	1
ye	1
are	1
of.	1
	1
9:56	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
men's	1
lives,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
another	1
village.	1
	1
9:57	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
9:58	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
9:59	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
another,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
9:60	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead:	1
but	1
go	1
thou	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:61	1
And	1
another	1
also	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee;	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
first	1
go	1
bid	1
them	1
farewell,	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
at	1
my	1
house.	1
	1
9:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
No	1
man,	1
having	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plough,	1
and	1
looking	1
back,	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
LORD	1
appointed	1
other	1
seventy	1
also,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
place,	1
whither	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
come.	1
	1
10:2	1
Therefore	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
great,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few:	1
pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:3	1
Go	1
your	1
ways:	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
lambs	1
among	1
wolves.	1
	1
10:4	1
Carry	1
neither	1
purse,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
nor	1
shoes:	1
and	1
salute	1
no	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter,	1
first	1
say,	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
house.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
there,	1
your	1
peace	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
it:	1
if	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
remain,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
give:	1
for	1
the	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
hire.	1
Go	1
not	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you,	1
eat	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
are	1
set	1
before	1
you:	1
10:9	1
And	1
heal	1
the	1
sick	1
that	1
are	1
therein,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:10	1
But	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you	1
not,	1
go	1
your	1
ways	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
say,	1
10:11	1
Even	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
city,	1
which	1
cleaveth	1
on	1
us,	1
we	1
do	1
wipe	1
off	1
against	1
you:	1
notwithstanding	1
be	1
ye	1
sure	1
of	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
Sodom,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
ago	1
repented,	1
sitting	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
to	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
thrust	1
down	1
to	1
hell.	1
	1
10:16	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
you	1
heareth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
you	1
despiseth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
me	1
despiseth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventy	1
returned	1
again	1
with	1
joy,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
even	1
the	1
devils	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
us	1
through	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
beheld	1
Satan	1
as	1
lightning	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:19	1
Behold,	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
power	1
to	1
tread	1
on	1
serpents	1
and	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
enemy:	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
hurt	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
in	1
this	1
rejoice	1
not,	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
rather	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
your	1
names	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:21	1
In	1
that	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes:	1
even	1
so,	1
Father;	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
10:22	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
who	1
the	1
Son	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
who	1
the	1
Father	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
privately,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
which	1
see	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
see:	1
10:24	1
For	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
kings	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
10:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
lawyer	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
tempted	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:26	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
how	1
readest	1
thou?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind;	1
and	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
answered	1
right:	1
this	1
do,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live.	1
	1
10:29	1
But	1
he,	1
willing	1
to	1
justify	1
himself,	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
neighbour?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Jericho,	1
and	1
fell	1
among	1
thieves,	1
which	1
stripped	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him,	1
and	1
departed,	1
leaving	1
him	1
half	1
dead.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
by	1
chance	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
that	1
way:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
likewise	1
a	1
Levite,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
Samaritan,	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
came	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him,	1
10:34	1
And	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
his	1
wounds,	1
pouring	1
in	1
oil	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
beast,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
inn,	1
and	1
took	1
care	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
he	1
departed,	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
two	1
pence,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
care	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
spendest	1
more,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
thee.	1
	1
10:36	1
Which	1
now	1
of	1
these	1
three,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
was	1
neighbour	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
fell	1
among	1
the	1
thieves?	1
	1
10:37	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
shewed	1
mercy	1
on	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
likewise.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village:	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Martha	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sister	1
called	1
Mary,	1
which	1
also	1
sat	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
10:40	1
But	1
Martha	1
was	1
cumbered	1
about	1
much	1
serving,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
hath	1
left	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
alone?	1
	1
bid	1
her	1
therefore	1
that	1
she	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Martha,	1
Martha,	1
thou	1
art	1
careful	1
and	1
troubled	1
about	1
many	1
things:	1
10:42	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
needful:	1
and	1
Mary	1
hath	1
chosen	1
that	1
good	1
part,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
praying	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place,	1
when	1
he	1
ceased,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
pray,	1
as	1
John	1
also	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
pray,	1
say,	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come.	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
in	1
heaven,	1
so	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
Give	1
us	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins;	1
for	1
we	1
also	1
forgive	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
indebted	1
to	1
us.	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation;	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
lend	1
me	1
three	1
loaves;	1
11:6	1
For	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
in	1
his	1
journey	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
him?	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
he	1
from	1
within	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say,	1
Trouble	1
me	1
not:	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
now	1
shut,	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
bed;	1
I	1
cannot	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
11:8	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Though	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
friend,	1
yet	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
importunity	1
he	1
will	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
needeth.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
11:11	1
If	1
a	1
son	1
shall	1
ask	1
bread	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
father,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
for	1
a	1
fish	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
11:12	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
ask	1
an	1
egg,	1
will	1
he	1
offer	1
him	1
a	1
scorpion?	1
	1
11:13	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
give	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
casting	1
out	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dumb.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
wondered.	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
others,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
sought	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:17	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
a	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
a	1
house	1
falleth.	1
	1
11:18	1
If	1
Satan	1
also	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
himself,	1
how	1
shall	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
because	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
sons	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
11:21	1
When	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
armed	1
keepeth	1
his	1
palace,	1
his	1
goods	1
are	1
in	1
peace:	1
11:22	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
stronger	1
than	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
overcome	1
him,	1
he	1
taketh	1
from	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
armour	1
wherein	1
he	1
trusted,	1
and	1
divideth	1
his	1
spoils.	1
	1
11:23	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth.	1
	1
11:24	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest;	1
and	1
finding	1
none,	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
house	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
swept	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
11:26	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
to	1
him	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself;	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things,	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
womb	1
that	1
bare	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sucked.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Yea	1
rather,	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
thick	1
together,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
generation:	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
Jonas	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
Ninevites,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
condemn	1
them:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
utmost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:32	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineve	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:33	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
putteth	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place,	1
neither	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
come	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
11:34	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
therefore	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
light;	1
but	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
evil,	1
thy	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:35	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
not	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:36	1
If	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
therefore	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
having	1
no	1
part	1
dark,	1
the	1
whole	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
bright	1
shining	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
doth	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spake,	1
a	1
certain	1
Pharisee	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
first	1
washed	1
before	1
dinner.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
do	1
ye	1
Pharisees	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
the	1
platter;	1
but	1
your	1
inward	1
part	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
ravening	1
and	1
wickedness.	1
	1
11:40	1
Ye	1
fools,	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
make	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
also?	1
	1
11:41	1
But	1
rather	1
give	1
alms	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
clean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:42	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
tithe	1
mint	1
and	1
rue	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
herbs,	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
judgment	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
11:43	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets.	1
	1
11:44	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
as	1
graves	1
which	1
appear	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
walk	1
over	1
them	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lawyers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
thus	1
saying	1
thou	1
reproachest	1
us	1
also.	1
	1
11:46	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
also,	1
ye	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
lade	1
men	1
with	1
burdens	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
burdens	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
fingers.	1
	1
11:47	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you!	1
for	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers	1
killed	1
them.	1
	1
11:48	1
Truly	1
ye	1
bear	1
witness	1
that	1
ye	1
allow	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
fathers:	1
for	1
they	1
indeed	1
killed	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
build	1
their	1
sepulchres.	1
	1
11:49	1
Therefore	1
also	1
said	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
them	1
prophets	1
and	1
apostles,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
slay	1
and	1
persecute:	1
11:50	1
That	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
was	1
shed	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
may	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation;	1
11:51	1
From	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
which	1
perished	1
between	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
temple:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:52	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
ye	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
entering	1
in	1
ye	1
hindered.	1
	1
11:53	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
11:54	1
Laying	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
seeking	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
an	1
innumerable	1
multitude	1
of	1
people,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
trode	1
one	1
upon	1
another,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
Beware	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
is	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
12:2	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
neither	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
darkness	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
light;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
ear	1
in	1
closets	1
shall	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
friends,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
do.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
forewarn	1
you	1
whom	1
ye	1
shall	1
fear:	1
Fear	1
him,	1
which	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
killed	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
cast	1
into	1
hell;	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Fear	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
Are	1
not	1
five	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
two	1
farthings,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
forgotten	1
before	1
God?	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
Fear	1
not	1
therefore:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
12:8	1
Also	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
also	1
confess	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God:	1
12:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
me	1
before	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
denied	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
blasphemeth	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
bring	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
unto	1
magistrates,	1
and	1
powers,	1
take	1
ye	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
say:	1
12:12	1
For	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
speak	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
divide	1
the	1
inheritance	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
who	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
judge	1
or	1
a	1
divider	1
over	1
you?	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
covetousness:	1
for	1
a	1
man's	1
life	1
consisteth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possesseth.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
ground	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man	1
brought	1
forth	1
plentifully:	1
12:17	1
And	1
he	1
thought	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
room	1
where	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
fruits?	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
will	1
I	1
do:	1
I	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
my	1
barns,	1
and	1
build	1
greater;	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
fruits	1
and	1
my	1
goods.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
soul,	1
Soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
much	1
goods	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
many	1
years;	1
take	1
thine	1
ease,	1
eat,	1
drink,	1
and	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
this	1
night	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
thee:	1
then	1
whose	1
shall	1
those	1
things	1
be,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
provided?	1
	1
12:21	1
So	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
layeth	1
up	1
treasure	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
rich	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat;	1
neither	1
for	1
the	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
	1
12:23	1
The	1
life	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
raiment.	1
	1
12:24	1
Consider	1
the	1
ravens:	1
for	1
they	1
neither	1
sow	1
nor	1
reap;	1
which	1
neither	1
have	1
storehouse	1
nor	1
barn;	1
and	1
God	1
feedeth	1
them:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
are	1
ye	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
fowls?	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
you	1
with	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
stature	1
one	1
cubit?	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
least,	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
rest?	1
	1
12:27	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
how	1
they	1
grow:	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
they	1
spin	1
not;	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
12:28	1
If	1
then	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
will	1
he	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
seek	1
not	1
ye	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
doubtful	1
mind.	1
	1
12:30	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seek	1
after:	1
and	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
rather	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:32	1
Fear	1
not,	1
little	1
flock;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
Father's	1
good	1
pleasure	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
12:33	1
Sell	1
that	1
ye	1
have,	1
and	1
give	1
alms;	1
provide	1
yourselves	1
bags	1
which	1
wax	1
not	1
old,	1
a	1
treasure	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
that	1
faileth	1
not,	1
where	1
no	1
thief	1
approacheth,	1
neither	1
moth	1
corrupteth.	1
	1
12:34	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
12:35	1
Let	1
your	1
loins	1
be	1
girded	1
about,	1
and	1
your	1
lights	1
burning;	1
12:36	1
And	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
like	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
lord,	1
when	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
wedding;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
and	1
knocketh,	1
they	1
may	1
open	1
unto	1
him	1
immediately.	1
	1
12:37	1
Blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants,	1
whom	1
the	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
watching:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
gird	1
himself,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
serve	1
them.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
watch,	1
or	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
watch,	1
and	1
find	1
them	1
so,	1
blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
this	1
know,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
hour	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
through.	1
	1
12:40	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
ready	1
also:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
ye	1
think	1
not.	1
	1
12:41	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
speakest	1
thou	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
us,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
all?	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
that	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
steward,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
shall	1
make	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
12:43	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
12:44	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
12:45	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
servant	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
and	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
menservants	1
and	1
maidens,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
drunken;	1
12:46	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
in	1
sunder,	1
and	1
will	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
that	1
servant,	1
which	1
knew	1
his	1
lord's	1
will,	1
and	1
prepared	1
not	1
himself,	1
neither	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
many	1
stripes.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
knew	1
not,	1
and	1
did	1
commit	1
things	1
worthy	1
of	1
stripes,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
few	1
stripes.	1
For	1
unto	1
whomsoever	1
much	1
is	1
given,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
required:	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
men	1
have	1
committed	1
much,	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
will	1
ask	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
12:49	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
I,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
already	1
kindled?	1
	1
12:50	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
baptism	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with;	1
and	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
straitened	1
till	1
it	1
be	1
accomplished!	1
	1
12:51	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
give	1
peace	1
on	1
earth?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
rather	1
division:	1
12:52	1
For	1
from	1
henceforth	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
five	1
in	1
one	1
house	1
divided,	1
three	1
against	1
two,	1
and	1
two	1
against	1
three.	1
	1
12:53	1
The	1
father	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
the	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
against	1
the	1
father;	1
the	1
mother	1
against	1
the	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
the	1
mother;	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
12:54	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
When	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
cloud	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
west,	1
straightway	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
shower;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
12:55	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blow,	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
heat;	1
and	1
it	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
12:56	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
discern	1
this	1
time?	1
	1
12:57	1
Yea,	1
and	1
why	1
even	1
of	1
yourselves	1
judge	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
right?	1
	1
12:58	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
to	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
give	1
diligence	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
him;	1
lest	1
he	1
hale	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
cast	1
thee	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
12:59	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
depart	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
mite.	1
	1
13:1	1
There	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
some	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
whose	1
blood	1
Pilate	1
had	1
mingled	1
with	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
these	1
Galilaeans	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
because	1
they	1
suffered	1
such	1
things?	1
	1
13:3	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:4	1
Or	1
those	1
eighteen,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
tower	1
in	1
Siloam	1
fell,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:6	1
He	1
spake	1
also	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
planted	1
in	1
his	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
sought	1
fruit	1
thereon,	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
dresser	1
of	1
his	1
vineyard,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
come	1
seeking	1
fruit	1
on	1
this	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
find	1
none:	1
cut	1
it	1
down;	1
why	1
cumbereth	1
it	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
let	1
it	1
alone	1
this	1
year	1
also,	1
till	1
I	1
shall	1
dig	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
dung	1
it:	1
13:9	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
bear	1
fruit,	1
well:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
it	1
down.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
infirmity	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
bowed	1
together,	1
and	1
could	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lift	1
up	1
herself.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
thou	1
art	1
loosed	1
from	1
thine	1
infirmity.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
was	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
answered	1
with	1
indignation,	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
healed	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
There	1
are	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
work:	1
in	1
them	1
therefore	1
come	1
and	1
be	1
healed,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
13:15	1
The	1
Lord	1
then	1
answered	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
doth	1
not	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
loose	1
his	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
ass	1
from	1
the	1
stall,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
watering?	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
ought	1
not	1
this	1
woman,	1
being	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
whom	1
Satan	1
hath	1
bound,	1
lo,	1
these	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
be	1
loosed	1
from	1
this	1
bond	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
all	1
his	1
adversaries	1
were	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
glorious	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
13:18	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Unto	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
like?	1
and	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
resemble	1
it?	1
	1
13:19	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
his	1
garden;	1
and	1
it	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
a	1
great	1
tree;	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
13:21	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching,	1
and	1
journeying	1
toward	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:23	1
Then	1
said	1
one	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
are	1
there	1
few	1
that	1
be	1
saved?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
13:24	1
Strive	1
to	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
many,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able.	1
	1
13:25	1
When	1
once	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
risen	1
up,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
stand	1
without,	1
and	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
unto	1
us;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are:	1
13:26	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk	1
in	1
thy	1
presence,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
in	1
our	1
streets.	1
	1
13:27	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are;	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
13:28	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
you	1
yourselves	1
thrust	1
out.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
are	1
last	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
first	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
last.	1
	1
13:31	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
came	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
depart	1
hence:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
and	1
tell	1
that	1
fox,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
cures	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
perfected.	1
	1
13:33	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
must	1
walk	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following:	1
for	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
perish	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:34	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee;	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
doth	1
gather	1
her	1
brood	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
13:35	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate:	1
and	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
Pharisees	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
	1
14:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
before	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
dropsy.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
lawyers	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go;	1
14:5	1
And	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
ass	1
or	1
an	1
ox	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
pit,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
straightway	1
pull	1
him	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
14:6	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
parable	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
bidden,	1
when	1
he	1
marked	1
how	1
they	1
chose	1
out	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms;	1
saying	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:8	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
wedding,	1
sit	1
not	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
room;	1
lest	1
a	1
more	1
honourable	1
man	1
than	1
thou	1
be	1
bidden	1
of	1
him;	1
14:9	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
this	1
man	1
place;	1
and	1
thou	1
begin	1
with	1
shame	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
lowest	1
room.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden,	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
room;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
cometh,	1
he	1
may	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Friend,	1
go	1
up	1
higher:	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
whosoever	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
14:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
also	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bade	1
him,	1
When	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
dinner	1
or	1
a	1
supper,	1
call	1
not	1
thy	1
friends,	1
nor	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
neither	1
thy	1
kinsmen,	1
nor	1
thy	1
rich	1
neighbours;	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
bid	1
thee	1
again,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
be	1
made	1
thee.	1
	1
14:13	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
feast,	1
call	1
the	1
poor,	1
the	1
maimed,	1
the	1
lame,	1
the	1
blind:	1
14:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blessed;	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
recompense	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
recompensed	1
at	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:16	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
him,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
supper,	1
and	1
bade	1
many:	1
14:17	1
And	1
sent	1
his	1
servant	1
at	1
supper	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden,	1
Come;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
now	1
ready.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
consent	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
excuse.	1
The	1
first	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
it:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
five	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prove	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
14:21	1
So	1
that	1
servant	1
came,	1
and	1
shewed	1
his	1
lord	1
these	1
things.	1
Then	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
being	1
angry	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
lanes	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
hither	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
maimed,	1
and	1
the	1
halt,	1
and	1
the	1
blind.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
room.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways	1
and	1
hedges,	1
and	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
that	1
my	1
house	1
may	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
14:24	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
shall	1
taste	1
of	1
my	1
supper.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
great	1
multitudes	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
14:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
hate	1
not	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
yea,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
also,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:28	1
For	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
intending	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
tower,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
counteth	1
the	1
cost,	1
whether	1
he	1
have	1
sufficient	1
to	1
finish	1
it?	1
14:29	1
Lest	1
haply,	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish	1
it,	1
all	1
that	1
behold	1
it	1
begin	1
to	1
mock	1
him,	1
14:30	1
Saying,	1
This	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish.	1
	1
14:31	1
Or	1
what	1
king,	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
another	1
king,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
consulteth	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
twenty	1
thousand?	1
	1
14:32	1
Or	1
else,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
an	1
ambassage,	1
and	1
desireth	1
conditions	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
14:33	1
So	1
likewise,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
forsaketh	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:34	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
seasoned?	1
	1
14:35	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
dunghill;	1
but	1
men	1
cast	1
it	1
out.	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
receiveth	1
sinners,	1
and	1
eateth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
15:4	1
What	1
man	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
if	1
he	1
lose	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
doth	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
go	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lost,	1
until	1
he	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
home,	1
he	1
calleth	1
together	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
neighbours,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
my	1
sheep	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
15:7	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
likewise	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
heaven	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth,	1
more	1
than	1
over	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
just	1
persons,	1
which	1
need	1
no	1
repentance.	1
	1
15:8	1
Either	1
what	1
woman	1
having	1
ten	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
if	1
she	1
lose	1
one	1
piece,	1
doth	1
not	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
sweep	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
seek	1
diligently	1
till	1
she	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
she	1
calleth	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
her	1
neighbours	1
together,	1
saying,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
piece	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
lost.	1
	1
15:10	1
Likewise,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
there	1
is	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons:	1
15:12	1
And	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Father,	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
goods	1
that	1
falleth	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
living.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
gathered	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
and	1
there	1
wasted	1
his	1
substance	1
with	1
riotous	1
living.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
all,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
mighty	1
famine	1
in	1
that	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
want.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
joined	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
that	1
country;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
fields	1
to	1
feed	1
swine.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
filled	1
his	1
belly	1
with	1
the	1
husks	1
that	1
the	1
swine	1
did	1
eat:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
many	1
hired	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
have	1
bread	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare,	1
and	1
I	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger!	1
15:18	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
before	1
thee,	1
15:19	1
And	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son:	1
make	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
hired	1
servants.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
his	1
father	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
compassion,	1
and	1
ran,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
15:22	1
But	1
the	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
best	1
robe,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
shoes	1
on	1
his	1
feet:	1
15:23	1
And	1
bring	1
hither	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
and	1
kill	1
it;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
eat,	1
and	1
be	1
merry:	1
15:24	1
For	1
this	1
my	1
son	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
he	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
15:25	1
Now	1
his	1
elder	1
son	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
heard	1
musick	1
and	1
dancing.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
meant.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
thy	1
father	1
hath	1
killed	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
received	1
him	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
in:	1
therefore	1
came	1
his	1
father	1
out,	1
and	1
intreated	1
him.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Lo,	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
do	1
I	1
serve	1
thee,	1
neither	1
transgressed	1
I	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thy	1
commandment:	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
never	1
gavest	1
me	1
a	1
kid,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
merry	1
with	1
my	1
friends:	1
15:30	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
thy	1
son	1
was	1
come,	1
which	1
hath	1
devoured	1
thy	1
living	1
with	1
harlots,	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
thou	1
art	1
ever	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
15:32	1
It	1
was	1
meet	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
be	1
glad:	1
for	1
this	1
thy	1
brother	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
and	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
steward;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
accused	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wasted	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
hear	1
this	1
of	1
thee?	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
thy	1
stewardship;	1
for	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
steward.	1
	1
16:3	1
Then	1
the	1
steward	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
for	1
my	1
lord	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
stewardship:	1
I	1
cannot	1
dig;	1
to	1
beg	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed.	1
	1
16:4	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stewardship,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
their	1
houses.	1
	1
16:5	1
So	1
he	1
called	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
lord's	1
debtors	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
first,	1
How	1
much	1
owest	1
thou	1
unto	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
oil.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
quickly,	1
and	1
write	1
fifty.	1
	1
16:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
another,	1
And	1
how	1
much	1
owest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
write	1
fourscore.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
commended	1
the	1
unjust	1
steward,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
wisely:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
generation	1
wiser	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mammon	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
fail,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
you	1
into	1
everlasting	1
habitations.	1
	1
16:10	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
least	1
is	1
faithful	1
also	1
in	1
much:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
unjust	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
is	1
unjust	1
also	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
16:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
mammon,	1
who	1
will	1
commit	1
to	1
your	1
trust	1
the	1
true	1
riches?	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
another	1
man's,	1
who	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
16:13	1
No	1
servant	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also,	1
who	1
were	1
covetous,	1
heard	1
all	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
they	1
derided	1
him.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
justify	1
yourselves	1
before	1
men;	1
but	1
God	1
knoweth	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
abomination	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:16	1
The	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
were	1
until	1
John:	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
preached,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
presseth	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
pass,	1
than	1
one	1
tittle	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
16:18	1
Whosoever	1
putteth	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marrieth	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
marrieth	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
16:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
fared	1
sumptuously	1
every	1
day:	1
16:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
beggar	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
which	1
was	1
laid	1
at	1
his	1
gate,	1
full	1
of	1
sores,	1
16:21	1
And	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
with	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
rich	1
man's	1
table:	1
moreover	1
the	1
dogs	1
came	1
and	1
licked	1
his	1
sores.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
beggar	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
angels	1
into	1
Abraham's	1
bosom:	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
also	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried;	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
hell	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
being	1
in	1
torments,	1
and	1
seeth	1
Abraham	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
Lazarus	1
in	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
Father	1
Abraham,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
send	1
Lazarus,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
dip	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
cool	1
my	1
tongue;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
tormented	1
in	1
this	1
flame.	1
	1
16:25	1
But	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
Son,	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
lifetime	1
receivedst	1
thy	1
good	1
things,	1
and	1
likewise	1
Lazarus	1
evil	1
things:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
comforted,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
tormented.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
gulf	1
fixed:	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
from	1
hence	1
to	1
you	1
cannot;	1
neither	1
can	1
they	1
pass	1
to	1
us,	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
16:27	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
therefore,	1
father,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
16:28	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
five	1
brethren;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
testify	1
unto	1
them,	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
place	1
of	1
torment.	1
	1
16:29	1
Abraham	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
let	1
them	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
father	1
Abraham:	1
but	1
if	1
one	1
went	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
will	1
repent.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
they	1
hear	1
not	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
neither	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
though	1
one	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:1	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
but	1
that	1
offences	1
will	1
come:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
him,	1
through	1
whom	1
they	1
come!	1
	1
17:2	1
It	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
17:3	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
If	1
thy	1
brother	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
rebuke	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
repent,	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
I	1
repent;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Increase	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
might	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
sycamine	1
tree,	1
Be	1
thou	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
root,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
obey	1
you.	1
	1
17:7	1
But	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
servant	1
plowing	1
or	1
feeding	1
cattle,	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
field,	1
Go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat?	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
rather	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Make	1
ready	1
wherewith	1
I	1
may	1
sup,	1
and	1
gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
serve	1
me,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunken;	1
and	1
afterward	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
17:9	1
Doth	1
he	1
thank	1
that	1
servant	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
commanded	1
him?	1
I	1
trow	1
not.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
commanded	1
you,	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
servants:	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Galilee.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
ten	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
lepers,	1
which	1
stood	1
afar	1
off:	1
17:13	1
And	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
shew	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
priests.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
were	1
cleansed.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
healed,	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
glorified	1
God,	1
17:16	1
And	1
fell	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
giving	1
him	1
thanks:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Samaritan.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
Were	1
there	1
not	1
ten	1
cleansed?	1
but	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
nine?	1
	1
17:18	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
found	1
that	1
returned	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
God,	1
save	1
this	1
stranger.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
when	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come,	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
not	1
with	1
observation:	1
17:21	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
say,	1
Lo	1
here!	1
or,	1
lo	1
there!	1
for,	1
behold,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
within	1
you.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
The	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
See	1
here;	1
or,	1
see	1
there:	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
them,	1
nor	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
17:24	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning,	1
that	1
lighteneth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
under	1
heaven,	1
shineth	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
under	1
heaven;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
day.	1
	1
17:25	1
But	1
first	1
must	1
he	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
17:27	1
They	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
married	1
wives,	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:28	1
Likewise	1
also	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Lot;	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
bought,	1
they	1
sold,	1
they	1
planted,	1
they	1
builded;	1
17:29	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Lot	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Sodom	1
it	1
rained	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:30	1
Even	1
thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
revealed.	1
	1
17:31	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
he	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
his	1
stuff	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
let	1
him	1
likewise	1
not	1
return	1
back.	1
	1
17:32	1
Remember	1
Lot's	1
wife.	1
	1
17:33	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
preserve	1
it.	1
	1
17:34	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
in	1
that	1
night	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
bed;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
shall	1
be	1
left.	1
	1
17:35	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
together;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:36	1
Two	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:37	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wheresoever	1
the	1
body	1
is,	1
thither	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
end,	1
that	1
men	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
faint;	1
18:2	1
Saying,	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
a	1
judge,	1
which	1
feared	1
not	1
God,	1
neither	1
regarded	1
man:	1
18:3	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
in	1
that	1
city;	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Avenge	1
me	1
of	1
mine	1
adversary.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
Though	1
I	1
fear	1
not	1
God,	1
nor	1
regard	1
man;	1
18:5	1
Yet	1
because	1
this	1
widow	1
troubleth	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
her,	1
lest	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
coming	1
she	1
weary	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Hear	1
what	1
the	1
unjust	1
judge	1
saith.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
God	1
avenge	1
his	1
own	1
elect,	1
which	1
cry	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
unto	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
bear	1
long	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
18:8	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
avenge	1
them	1
speedily.	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
he	1
find	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
certain	1
which	1
trusted	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
righteous,	1
and	1
despised	1
others:	1
18:10	1
Two	1
men	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
pray;	1
the	1
one	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:11	1
The	1
Pharisee	1
stood	1
and	1
prayed	1
thus	1
with	1
himself,	1
God,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
men	1
are,	1
extortioners,	1
unjust,	1
adulterers,	1
or	1
even	1
as	1
this	1
publican.	1
	1
18:12	1
I	1
fast	1
twice	1
in	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
give	1
tithes	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
possess.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
publican,	1
standing	1
afar	1
off,	1
would	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
but	1
smote	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
saying,	1
God	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
18:14	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
justified	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
also	1
infants,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
touch	1
them:	1
but	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:17	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
none	1
is	1
good,	1
save	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
18:20	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
All	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up.	1
	1
18:22	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yet	1
lackest	1
thou	1
one	1
thing:	1
sell	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
distribute	1
unto	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
this,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
rich.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
18:25	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
needle's	1
eye,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
impossible	1
with	1
men	1
are	1
possible	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
parents,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God's	1
sake,	1
18:30	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
manifold	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
concerning	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished.	1
	1
18:32	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
mocked,	1
and	1
spitefully	1
entreated,	1
and	1
spitted	1
on:	1
18:33	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
neither	1
knew	1
they	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken.	1
	1
18:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
certain	1
blind	1
man	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
begging:	1
18:36	1
And	1
hearing	1
the	1
multitude	1
pass	1
by,	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
	1
18:37	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
passeth	1
by.	1
	1
18:38	1
And	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:39	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
18:41	1
Saying,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
18:42	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Receive	1
thy	1
sight:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee.	1
	1
18:43	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
glorifying	1
God:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
gave	1
praise	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Jericho.	1
	1
19:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Zacchaeus,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
among	1
the	1
publicans,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
rich.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
see	1
Jesus	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
of	1
stature.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
before,	1
and	1
climbed	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sycomore	1
tree	1
to	1
see	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Zacchaeus,	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
come	1
down;	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
I	1
must	1
abide	1
at	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
received	1
him	1
joyfully.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
all	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
be	1
guest	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
Zacchaeus	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Behold,	1
Lord,	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
goods	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
any	1
man	1
by	1
false	1
accusation,	1
I	1
restore	1
him	1
fourfold.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
salvation	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
house,	1
forsomuch	1
as	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
19:10	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
spake	1
a	1
parable,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
immediately	1
appear.	1
	1
19:12	1
He	1
said	1
therefore,	1
A	1
certain	1
nobleman	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
to	1
receive	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
ten	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
ten	1
pounds,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Occupy	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
his	1
citizens	1
hated	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
after	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
returned,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
then	1
he	1
commanded	1
these	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
money,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
gained	1
by	1
trading.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
first,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
thou	1
good	1
servant:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
little,	1
have	1
thou	1
authority	1
over	1
ten	1
cities.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
five	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
likewise	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
thou	1
also	1
over	1
five	1
cities.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
another	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
is	1
thy	1
pound,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
napkin:	1
19:21	1
For	1
I	1
feared	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
austere	1
man:	1
thou	1
takest	1
up	1
that	1
thou	1
layedst	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reapest	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
sow.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
mouth	1
will	1
I	1
judge	1
thee,	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant.	1
Thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
austere	1
man,	1
taking	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
laid	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reaping	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sow:	1
19:23	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
gavest	1
not	1
thou	1
my	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
bank,	1
that	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
required	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury?	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Take	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
pound,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:25	1
(And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
he	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.)	1
	1
19:26	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
19:27	1
But	1
those	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
reign	1
over	1
them,	1
bring	1
hither,	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
went	1
before,	1
ascending	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
19:30	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
at	1
your	1
entering	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
yet	1
never	1
man	1
sat:	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
ask	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
loose	1
him?	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:32	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt,	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
loose	1
ye	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
upon	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
Jesus	1
thereon.	1
	1
19:36	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
they	1
spread	1
their	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh,	1
even	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
and	1
praise	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen;	1
19:38	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
peace	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
multitude	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
rebuke	1
thy	1
disciples.	1
	1
19:40	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
if	1
these	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
the	1
stones	1
would	1
immediately	1
cry	1
out.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
wept	1
over	1
it,	1
19:42	1
Saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
hadst	1
known,	1
even	1
thou,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
day,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
belong	1
unto	1
thy	1
peace!	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:43	1
For	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
trench	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
compass	1
thee	1
round,	1
and	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
19:44	1
And	1
shall	1
lay	1
thee	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
within	1
thee;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
in	1
thee	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another;	1
because	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
visitation.	1
	1
19:45	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
therein,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
bought;	1
19:46	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
19:47	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
him,	1
19:48	1
And	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
days,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
20:2	1
And	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
and	1
answer	1
me:	1
20:4	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
believed	1
ye	1
him	1
not?	1
	1
20:6	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
stone	1
us:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
forth	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard:	1
but	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another	1
servant:	1
and	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
shamefully,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
third:	1
and	1
they	1
wounded	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
20:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
beloved	1
son:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
reverence	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir:	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
inheritance	1
may	1
be	1
ours.	1
	1
20:15	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
killed	1
him.	1
What	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
20:16	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
these	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
to	1
others.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner?	1
	1
20:18	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
that	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
parable	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
spies,	1
which	1
should	1
feign	1
themselves	1
just	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
that	1
so	1
they	1
might	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
sayest	1
and	1
teachest	1
rightly,	1
neither	1
acceptest	1
thou	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
any,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
truly:	1
20:22	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
no?	1
	1
20:23	1
But	1
he	1
perceived	1
their	1
craftiness,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
	1
20:24	1
Shew	1
me	1
a	1
penny.	1
Whose	1
image	1
and	1
superscription	1
hath	1
it?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
God's.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
before	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
his	1
answer,	1
and	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
20:28	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
having	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
without	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
20:29	1
There	1
were	1
therefore	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
children.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
childless.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
took	1
her;	1
and	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
the	1
seven	1
also:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
no	1
children,	1
and	1
died.	1
	1
20:32	1
Last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
20:33	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
she?	1
for	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
marry,	1
and	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:35	1
But	1
they	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:36	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
die	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
equal	1
unto	1
the	1
angels;	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
being	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:37	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
even	1
Moses	1
shewed	1
at	1
the	1
bush,	1
when	1
he	1
calleth	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
20:38	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
for	1
all	1
live	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
20:39	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
answering	1
said,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
say	1
they	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
David's	1
son?	1
20:42	1
And	1
David	1
himself	1
saith	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
20:43	1
Till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
20:44	1
David	1
therefore	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
20:45	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
20:46	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
desire	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
long	1
robes,	1
and	1
love	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
the	1
highest	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts;	1
20:47	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
shew	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
casting	1
their	1
gifts	1
into	1
the	1
treasury.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
also	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow	1
casting	1
in	1
thither	1
two	1
mites.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
21:4	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
of	1
their	1
abundance	1
cast	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
penury	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
that	1
she	1
had.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
as	1
some	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
adorned	1
with	1
goodly	1
stones	1
and	1
gifts,	1
he	1
said,	1
21:6	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
but	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
	1
and	1
what	1
sign	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass?	1
21:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
for	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
draweth	1
near:	1
go	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
21:9	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
commotions,	1
be	1
not	1
terrified:	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
first	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
by	1
and	1
by.	1
	1
21:10	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
21:11	1
And	1
great	1
earthquakes	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences;	1
and	1
fearful	1
sights	1
and	1
great	1
signs	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
21:12	1
But	1
before	1
all	1
these,	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
delivering	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
into	1
prisons,	1
being	1
brought	1
before	1
kings	1
and	1
rulers	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
testimony.	1
	1
21:14	1
Settle	1
it	1
therefore	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
not	1
to	1
meditate	1
before	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer:	1
21:15	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
mouth	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
all	1
your	1
adversaries	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
gainsay	1
nor	1
resist.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
both	1
by	1
parents,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
kinsfolks,	1
and	1
friends;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
they	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:18	1
But	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
perish.	1
	1
21:19	1
In	1
your	1
patience	1
possess	1
ye	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Jerusalem	1
compassed	1
with	1
armies,	1
then	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
desolation	1
thereof	1
is	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:21	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
depart	1
out;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
countries	1
enter	1
thereinto.	1
	1
21:22	1
For	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
vengeance,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:23	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck,	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
distress	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
wrath	1
upon	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stars;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
distress	1
of	1
nations,	1
with	1
perplexity;	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
roaring;	1
21:26	1
Men's	1
hearts	1
failing	1
them	1
for	1
fear,	1
and	1
for	1
looking	1
after	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
coming	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
begin	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
then	1
look	1
up,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads;	1
for	1
your	1
redemption	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
parable;	1
Behold	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees;	1
21:30	1
When	1
they	1
now	1
shoot	1
forth,	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
now	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:31	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:32	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:33	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
your	1
hearts	1
be	1
overcharged	1
with	1
surfeiting,	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
day	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
unawares.	1
	1
21:35	1
For	1
as	1
a	1
snare	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
21:36	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
pray	1
always,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
escape	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
21:38	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
22:1	1
Now	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Passover.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
kill	1
him;	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
22:3	1
Then	1
entered	1
Satan	1
into	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Iscariot,	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
captains,	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
covenanted	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
promised,	1
and	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
22:7	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
the	1
passover	1
must	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
prepare	1
us	1
the	1
passover,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare?	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
there	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
meet	1
you,	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water;	1
follow	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
entereth	1
in.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished:	1
there	1
make	1
ready.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
eat	1
this	1
passover	1
with	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
suffer:	1
22:16	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take	1
this,	1
and	1
divide	1
it	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
22:20	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
cup	1
after	1
supper,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
But,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
truly	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
determined:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
enquire	1
among	1
themselves,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
strife	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
accounted	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them	1
are	1
called	1
benefactors.	1
	1
22:26	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
younger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
chief,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
serve.	1
	1
22:27	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat,	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
serveth?	1
	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat?	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
among	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
serveth.	1
	1
22:28	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
temptations.	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
I	1
appoint	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
appointed	1
unto	1
me;	1
22:30	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
thrones	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Simon,	1
Simon,	1
behold,	1
Satan	1
hath	1
desired	1
to	1
have	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sift	1
you	1
as	1
wheat:	1
22:32	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
prayed	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
thy	1
faith	1
fail	1
not:	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
converted,	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
brethren.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
both	1
into	1
prison,	1
and	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Peter,	1
the	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow	1
this	1
day,	1
before	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
thrice	1
deny	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
me.	1
	1
22:35	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
without	1
purse,	1
and	1
scrip,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
lacked	1
ye	1
any	1
thing?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Nothing.	1
	1
22:36	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
now,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
purse,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
likewise	1
his	1
scrip:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
sword,	1
let	1
him	1
sell	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
buy	1
one.	1
	1
22:37	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
must	1
yet	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
me,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
reckoned	1
among	1
the	1
transgressors:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
me	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
22:38	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
swords.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
enough.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
went,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
to	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
also	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
22:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Pray	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:41	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
them	1
about	1
a	1
stone's	1
cast,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
Father,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
willing,	1
remove	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
my	1
will,	1
but	1
thine,	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:43	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
an	1
angel	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
heaven,	1
strengthening	1
him.	1
	1
22:44	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
he	1
prayed	1
more	1
earnestly:	1
and	1
his	1
sweat	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
great	1
drops	1
of	1
blood	1
falling	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
22:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
prayer,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
sleeping	1
for	1
sorrow,	1
22:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
sleep	1
ye?	1
rise	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold	1
a	1
multitude,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
	1
22:48	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Judas,	1
betrayest	1
thou	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
kiss?	1
	1
22:49	1
When	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
saw	1
what	1
would	1
follow,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
we	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
sword?	1
22:50	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
smote	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
	1
22:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
ye	1
thus	1
far.	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
22:52	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves?	1
	1
22:53	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
ye	1
stretched	1
forth	1
no	1
hands	1
against	1
me:	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
hour,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
22:54	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
house.	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
22:55	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
together,	1
Peter	1
sat	1
down	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
22:56	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
maid	1
beheld	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
earnestly	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:57	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Woman,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
22:58	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
another	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
also	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
22:59	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
one	1
hour	1
after	1
another	1
confidently	1
affirmed,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
fellow	1
also	1
was	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
22:60	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
22:61	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
turned,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
Peter.	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
22:62	1
And	1
Peter	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
22:63	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
held	1
Jesus	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him.	1
	1
22:64	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
blindfolded	1
him,	1
they	1
struck	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy,	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
22:65	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
blasphemously	1
spake	1
they	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:66	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
their	1
council,	1
saying,	1
22:67	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ?	1
tell	1
us.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe:	1
22:68	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
also	1
ask	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
me,	1
nor	1
let	1
me	1
go.	1
	1
22:69	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:70	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
all,	1
Art	1
thou	1
then	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
22:71	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witness?	1
for	1
we	1
ourselves	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
arose,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
found	1
this	1
fellow	1
perverting	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
forbidding	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
Christ	1
a	1
King.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
23:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
fierce,	1
saying,	1
He	1
stirreth	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
teaching	1
throughout	1
all	1
Jewry,	1
beginning	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
23:6	1
When	1
Pilate	1
heard	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
belonged	1
unto	1
Herod's	1
jurisdiction,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Herod,	1
who	1
himself	1
also	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
season,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
some	1
miracle	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
23:9	1
Then	1
he	1
questioned	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
many	1
words;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
nothing.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
stood	1
and	1
vehemently	1
accused	1
him.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
Herod	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
nought,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
gorgeous	1
robe,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
Pilate	1
and	1
Herod	1
were	1
made	1
friends	1
together:	1
for	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
enmity	1
between	1
themselves.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
23:14	1
Said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
man	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
perverteth	1
the	1
people:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
having	1
examined	1
him	1
before	1
you,	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man	1
touching	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
accuse	1
him:	1
23:15	1
No,	1
nor	1
yet	1
Herod:	1
for	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
release	1
him.	1
	1
23:17	1
(For	1
of	1
necessity	1
he	1
must	1
release	1
one	1
unto	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
feast.)	1
23:18	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
saying,	1
Away	1
with	1
this	1
man,	1
and	1
release	1
unto	1
us	1
Barabbas:	1
23:19	1
(Who	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
sedition	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
for	1
murder,	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.)	1
	1
23:20	1
Pilate	1
therefore,	1
willing	1
to	1
release	1
Jesus,	1
spake	1
again	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
they	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
instant	1
with	1
loud	1
voices,	1
requiring	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
prevailed.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
sentence	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
they	1
required.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
him	1
that	1
for	1
sedition	1
and	1
murder	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
desired;	1
but	1
he	1
delivered	1
Jesus	1
to	1
their	1
will.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
they	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
one	1
Simon,	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
on	1
him	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bear	1
it	1
after	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:27	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
women,	1
which	1
also	1
bewailed	1
and	1
lamented	1
him.	1
	1
23:28	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turning	1
unto	1
them	1
said,	1
Daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
weep	1
not	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
weep	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
children.	1
	1
23:29	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
barren,	1
and	1
the	1
wombs	1
that	1
never	1
bare,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
never	1
gave	1
suck.	1
	1
23:30	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Cover	1
us.	1
	1
23:31	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
tree,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
dry?	1
	1
23:32	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
two	1
other,	1
malefactors,	1
led	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Calvary,	1
there	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
malefactors,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
23:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Father,	1
forgive	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
do.	1
And	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
23:35	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
beholding.	1
And	1
the	1
rulers	1
also	1
with	1
them	1
derided	1
him,	1
saying,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
let	1
him	1
save	1
himself,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
Christ,	1
the	1
chosen	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:36	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
also	1
mocked	1
him,	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
offering	1
him	1
vinegar,	1
23:37	1
And	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
	1
23:38	1
And	1
a	1
superscription	1
also	1
was	1
written	1
over	1
him	1
in	1
letters	1
of	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin,	1
and	1
Hebrew,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
23:39	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
malefactors	1
which	1
were	1
hanged	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
Christ,	1
save	1
thyself	1
and	1
us.	1
	1
23:40	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
answering	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Dost	1
not	1
thou	1
fear	1
God,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condemnation?	1
	1
23:41	1
And	1
we	1
indeed	1
justly;	1
for	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
due	1
reward	1
of	1
our	1
deeds:	1
but	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done	1
nothing	1
amiss.	1
	1
23:42	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
remember	1
me	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
into	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
23:43	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
To	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
paradise.	1
	1
23:44	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
23:45	1
And	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
23:46	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
said,	1
Father,	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
I	1
commend	1
my	1
spirit:	1
and	1
having	1
said	1
thus,	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
23:47	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
he	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Certainly	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
righteous	1
man.	1
	1
23:48	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
that	1
sight,	1
beholding	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
done,	1
smote	1
their	1
breasts,	1
and	1
returned.	1
	1
23:49	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
followed	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
beholding	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
23:50	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
a	1
counsellor;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
just:	1
23:51	1
(The	1
same	1
had	1
not	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
counsel	1
and	1
deed	1
of	1
them;)	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:52	1
This	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:53	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
was	1
hewn	1
in	1
stone,	1
wherein	1
never	1
man	1
before	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:54	1
And	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath	1
drew	1
on.	1
	1
23:55	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
also,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
after,	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
how	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:56	1
And	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
prepared	1
spices	1
and	1
ointments;	1
and	1
rested	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
24:1	1
Now	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
bringing	1
the	1
spices	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
prepared,	1
and	1
certain	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
stone	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
they	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
perplexed	1
thereabout,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
shining	1
garments:	1
24:5	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
living	1
among	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
24:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
but	1
is	1
risen:	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
24:7	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinful	1
men,	1
and	1
be	1
crucified,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
they	1
remembered	1
his	1
words,	1
24:9	1
And	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
24:10	1
It	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Joanna,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
other	1
women	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
which	1
told	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
their	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
idle	1
tales,	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
24:12	1
Then	1
arose	1
Peter,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
and	1
stooping	1
down,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
laid	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
departed,	1
wondering	1
in	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
24:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
village	1
called	1
Emmaus,	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
about	1
threescore	1
furlongs.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
they	1
talked	1
together	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
happened.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
communed	1
together	1
and	1
reasoned,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:16	1
But	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
holden	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
communications	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
ye	1
walk,	1
and	1
are	1
sad?	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Cleopas,	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
only	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
there	1
in	1
these	1
days?	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
things?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Concerning	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
mighty	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
word	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
24:20	1
And	1
how	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
our	1
rulers	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
condemned	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
have	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
24:21	1
But	1
we	1
trusted	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
he	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
redeemed	1
Israel:	1
and	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
since	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
24:22	1
Yea,	1
and	1
certain	1
women	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
company	1
made	1
us	1
astonished,	1
which	1
were	1
early	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
24:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
not	1
his	1
body,	1
they	1
came,	1
saying,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
angels,	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
even	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
said:	1
but	1
him	1
they	1
saw	1
not.	1
	1
24:25	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
fools,	1
and	1
slow	1
of	1
heart	1
to	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
spoken:	1
24:26	1
Ought	1
not	1
Christ	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
glory?	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
beginning	1
at	1
Moses	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
he	1
expounded	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
himself.	1
	1
24:28	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
village,	1
whither	1
they	1
went:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
further.	1
	1
24:29	1
But	1
they	1
constrained	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Abide	1
with	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
toward	1
evening,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
far	1
spent.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
vanished	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Did	1
not	1
our	1
heart	1
burn	1
within	1
us,	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
opened	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
scriptures?	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
eleven	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
24:34	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
risen	1
indeed,	1
and	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
Simon.	1
	1
24:35	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
24:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
thus	1
spake,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
terrified	1
and	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
spirit.	1
	1
24:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
troubled?	1
and	1
why	1
do	1
thoughts	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
24:39	1
Behold	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
feet,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
myself:	1
handle	1
me,	1
and	1
see;	1
for	1
a	1
spirit	1
hath	1
not	1
flesh	1
and	1
bones,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
have.	1
	1
24:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
shewed	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
24:41	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
yet	1
believed	1
not	1
for	1
joy,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
here	1
any	1
meat?	1
	1
24:42	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
broiled	1
fish,	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
honeycomb.	1
	1
24:43	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
24:44	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
psalms,	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
24:45	1
Then	1
opened	1
he	1
their	1
understanding,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
understand	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
24:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
behoved	1
Christ	1
to	1
suffer,	1
and	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
24:47	1
And	1
that	1
repentance	1
and	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
beginning	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
24:48	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
24:49	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
upon	1
you:	1
but	1
tarry	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
until	1
ye	1
be	1
endued	1
with	1
power	1
from	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
24:50	1
And	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
24:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
parted	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
up	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
24:52	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
great	1
joy:	1
24:53	1
And	1
were	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
praising	1
and	1
blessing	1
God.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
God.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
same	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:3	1
All	1
things	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
without	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
made	1
that	1
was	1
made.	1
	1
1:4	1
In	1
him	1
was	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
shineth	1
in	1
darkness;	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
comprehended	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
sent	1
from	1
God,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
John.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
for	1
a	1
witness,	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
Light,	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
1:8	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Light,	1
but	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
that	1
Light.	1
	1
1:9	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
Light,	1
which	1
lighteth	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:10	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:11	1
He	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
received	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
received	1
him,	1
to	1
them	1
gave	1
he	1
power	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name:	1
1:13	1
Which	1
were	1
born,	1
not	1
of	1
blood,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
made	1
flesh,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
among	1
us,	1
(and	1
we	1
beheld	1
his	1
glory,	1
the	1
glory	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father,)	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
John	1
bare	1
witness	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
This	1
was	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spake,	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
of	1
his	1
fulness	1
have	1
all	1
we	1
received,	1
and	1
grace	1
for	1
grace.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
Moses,	1
but	1
grace	1
and	1
truth	1
came	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:18	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
John,	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
sent	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
he	1
confessed,	1
and	1
denied	1
not;	1
but	1
confessed,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
then?	1
Art	1
thou	1
Elias?	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
prophet?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
No.	1
	1
1:22	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sent	1
us.	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
thyself?	1
	1
1:23	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Make	1
straight	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
said	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
baptizest	1
thou	1
then,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
that	1
Christ,	1
nor	1
Elias,	1
neither	1
that	1
prophet?	1
	1
1:26	1
John	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
baptize	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
there	1
standeth	1
one	1
among	1
you,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not;	1
1:27	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
who	1
coming	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoe's	1
latchet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:28	1
These	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
Bethabara	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
where	1
John	1
was	1
baptizing.	1
	1
1:29	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
John	1
seeth	1
Jesus	1
coming	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:30	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
said,	1
After	1
me	1
cometh	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
Israel,	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
baptizing	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
John	1
bare	1
record,	1
saying,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending	1
from	1
heaven	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
it	1
abode	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
baptize	1
with	1
water,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Upon	1
whom	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending,	1
and	1
remaining	1
on	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
baptizeth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
bare	1
record	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:35	1
Again	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
after	1
John	1
stood,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples;	1
1:36	1
And	1
looking	1
upon	1
Jesus	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
disciples	1
heard	1
him	1
speak,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:38	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
turned,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
following,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
seek	1
ye?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
(which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Master,)	1
where	1
dwellest	1
thou?	1
	1
1:39	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
They	1
came	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
he	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
tenth	1
hour.	1
	1
1:40	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
which	1
heard	1
John	1
speak,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
was	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:41	1
He	1
first	1
findeth	1
his	1
own	1
brother	1
Simon,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
Messias,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Simon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jona:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
Cephas,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
A	1
stone.	1
	1
1:43	1
The	1
day	1
following	1
Jesus	1
would	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
findeth	1
Philip,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
1:44	1
Now	1
Philip	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Peter.	1
	1
1:45	1
Philip	1
findeth	1
Nathanael,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
of	1
whom	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
write,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Nathanael	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Can	1
there	1
any	1
good	1
thing	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
1:47	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
Nathanael	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
of	1
him,	1
Behold	1
an	1
Israelite	1
indeed,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
guile!	1
	1
1:48	1
Nathanael	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
knowest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
that	1
Philip	1
called	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee.	1
	1
1:49	1
Nathanael	1
answered	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:50	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
believest	1
thou?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
things	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
1:51	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
heaven	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending	1
upon	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
marriage	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
was	1
there:	1
2:2	1
And	1
both	1
Jesus	1
was	1
called,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
wanted	1
wine,	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
wine.	1
	1
2:4	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1
mine	1
hour	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
2:5	1
His	1
mother	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
servants,	1
Whatsoever	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
you,	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
set	1
there	1
six	1
waterpots	1
of	1
stone,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
containing	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
firkins	1
apiece.	1
	1
2:7	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fill	1
the	1
waterpots	1
with	1
water.	1
And	1
they	1
filled	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
brim.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Draw	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
bear	1
unto	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
And	1
they	1
bare	1
it.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
had	1
tasted	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
wine,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
whence	1
it	1
was:	1
(but	1
the	1
servants	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
water	1
knew;)	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
called	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
2:10	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Every	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
doth	1
set	1
forth	1
good	1
wine;	1
and	1
when	1
men	1
have	1
well	1
drunk,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
worse:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
good	1
wine	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:11	1
This	1
beginning	1
of	1
miracles	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
manifested	1
forth	1
his	1
glory;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
2:12	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
there	1
not	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
those	1
that	1
sold	1
oxen	1
and	1
sheep	1
and	1
doves,	1
and	1
the	1
changers	1
of	1
money	1
sitting:	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
scourge	1
of	1
small	1
cords,	1
he	1
drove	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
oxen;	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
changers'	1
money,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables;	1
2:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
Take	1
these	1
things	1
hence;	1
make	1
not	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
merchandise.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
hath	1
eaten	1
me	1
up.	1
	1
2:18	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
unto	1
us,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:19	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Destroy	1
this	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Forty	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
was	1
this	1
temple	1
in	1
building,	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
rear	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
three	1
days?	1
	1
2:21	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
his	1
body.	1
	1
2:22	1
When	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
the	1
scripture,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
2:23	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
passover,	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
Jesus	1
did	1
not	1
commit	1
himself	1
unto	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
men,	1
2:25	1
And	1
needed	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
testify	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
named	1
Nicodemus,	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
3:2	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
teacher	1
come	1
from	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
these	1
miracles	1
that	1
thou	1
doest,	1
except	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
again,	1
he	1
cannot	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
old?	1
can	1
he	1
enter	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
into	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
be	1
born?	1
	1
3:5	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
he	1
cannot	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:6	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
flesh;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:7	1
Marvel	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
born	1
again.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
wind	1
bloweth	1
where	1
it	1
listeth,	1
and	1
thou	1
hearest	1
the	1
sound	1
thereof,	1
but	1
canst	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
cometh,	1
and	1
whither	1
it	1
goeth:	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:9	1
Nicodemus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
3:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
master	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
3:11	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
We	1
speak	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
know,	1
and	1
testify	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen;	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
our	1
witness.	1
	1
3:12	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
earthly	1
things,	1
and	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe,	1
if	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
as	1
Moses	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
serpent	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
even	1
so	1
must	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
lifted	1
up:	1
3:15	1
That	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
God	1
sent	1
not	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
condemn	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:18	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
condemned:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
is	1
condemned	1
already,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
condemnation,	1
that	1
light	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
men	1
loved	1
darkness	1
rather	1
than	1
light,	1
because	1
their	1
deeds	1
were	1
evil.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hateth	1
the	1
light,	1
neither	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
his	1
deeds	1
should	1
be	1
reproved.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
truth	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
his	1
deeds	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
wrought	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
tarried	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
John	1
also	1
was	1
baptizing	1
in	1
Aenon	1
near	1
to	1
Salim,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
water	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:24	1
For	1
John	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
3:25	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
question	1
between	1
some	1
of	1
John's	1
disciples	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
about	1
purifying.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
barest	1
witness,	1
behold,	1
the	1
same	1
baptizeth,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
3:27	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
can	1
receive	1
nothing,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:28	1
Ye	1
yourselves	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
bride	1
is	1
the	1
bridegroom:	1
but	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
which	1
standeth	1
and	1
heareth	1
him,	1
rejoiceth	1
greatly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom's	1
voice:	1
this	1
my	1
joy	1
therefore	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:30	1
He	1
must	1
increase,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
decrease.	1
	1
3:31	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
above	1
all:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
earthly,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
heaven	1
is	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
and	1
heard,	1
that	1
he	1
testifieth;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
receiveth	1
his	1
testimony.	1
	1
3:33	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
received	1
his	1
testimony	1
hath	1
set	1
to	1
his	1
seal	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
3:34	1
For	1
he	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
speaketh	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
giveth	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
measure	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:35	1
The	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:36	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
life;	1
but	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
When	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
made	1
and	1
baptized	1
more	1
disciples	1
than	1
John,	1
4:2	1
(Though	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
baptized	1
not,	1
but	1
his	1
disciples,)	1
4:3	1
He	1
left	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
he	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
through	1
Samaria.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Sychar,	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
ground	1
that	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Joseph.	1
	1
4:6	1
Now	1
Jacob's	1
well	1
was	1
there.	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
being	1
wearied	1
with	1
his	1
journey,	1
sat	1
thus	1
on	1
the	1
well:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour.	1
	1
4:7	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
to	1
draw	1
water:	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
4:8	1
(For	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
buy	1
meat.)	1
	1
4:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
askest	1
drink	1
of	1
me,	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria?	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
no	1
dealings	1
with	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
4:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
knewest	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink;	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
have	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
draw	1
with,	1
and	1
the	1
well	1
is	1
deep:	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
living	1
water?	1
4:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
gave	1
us	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
drank	1
thereof	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
his	1
cattle?	1
	1
4:13	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
this	1
water	1
shall	1
thirst	1
again:	1
4:14	1
But	1
whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst;	1
but	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
springing	1
up	1
into	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
4:15	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
water,	1
that	1
I	1
thirst	1
not,	1
neither	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
draw.	1
	1
4:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go,	1
call	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
4:17	1
The	1
woman	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband.	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband:	1
4:18	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
five	1
husbands;	1
and	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
now	1
hast	1
is	1
not	1
thy	1
husband:	1
in	1
that	1
saidst	1
thou	1
truly.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
4:20	1
Our	1
fathers	1
worshipped	1
in	1
this	1
mountain;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
4:21	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
mountain,	1
nor	1
yet	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
worship	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
4:22	1
Ye	1
worship	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what:	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
worship:	1
for	1
salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
true	1
worshippers	1
shall	1
worship	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth:	1
for	1
the	1
Father	1
seeketh	1
such	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
4:24	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
worship	1
him	1
must	1
worship	1
him	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
4:25	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Messias	1
cometh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ:	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
4:26	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
that	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
upon	1
this	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
woman:	1
yet	1
no	1
man	1
said,	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
or,	1
Why	1
talkest	1
thou	1
with	1
her?	1
	1
4:28	1
The	1
woman	1
then	1
left	1
her	1
waterpot,	1
and	1
went	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
4:29	1
Come,	1
see	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
Christ?	1
	1
4:30	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:31	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
his	1
disciples	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
eat.	1
	1
4:32	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
meat	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
of.	1
	1
4:33	1
Therefore	1
said	1
the	1
disciples	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Hath	1
any	1
man	1
brought	1
him	1
ought	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
4:34	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
meat	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
4:35	1
Say	1
not	1
ye,	1
There	1
are	1
yet	1
four	1
months,	1
and	1
then	1
cometh	1
harvest?	1
behold,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
fields;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
white	1
already	1
to	1
harvest.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
receiveth	1
wages,	1
and	1
gathereth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal:	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
may	1
rejoice	1
together.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
herein	1
is	1
that	1
saying	1
true,	1
One	1
soweth,	1
and	1
another	1
reapeth.	1
	1
4:38	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
reap	1
that	1
whereon	1
ye	1
bestowed	1
no	1
labour:	1
other	1
men	1
laboured,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
labours.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
which	1
testified,	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did.	1
	1
4:40	1
So	1
when	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
tarry	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
he	1
abode	1
there	1
two	1
days.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
believed	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
word;	1
4:42	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Now	1
we	1
believe,	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
saying:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:43	1
Now	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:44	1
For	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
testified,	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
hath	1
no	1
honour	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:45	1
Then	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
the	1
Galilaeans	1
received	1
him,	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
for	1
they	1
also	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
4:46	1
So	1
Jesus	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
where	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
water	1
wine.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
nobleman,	1
whose	1
son	1
was	1
sick	1
at	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
4:47	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
4:48	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Except	1
ye	1
see	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
4:49	1
The	1
nobleman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
come	1
down	1
ere	1
my	1
child	1
die.	1
	1
4:50	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
believed	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
4:51	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
down,	1
his	1
servants	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:52	1
Then	1
enquired	1
he	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
amend.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
seventh	1
hour	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
him.	1
	1
4:53	1
So	1
the	1
father	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth:	1
and	1
himself	1
believed,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
house.	1
	1
4:54	1
This	1
is	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
After	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
5:2	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
sheep	1
market	1
a	1
pool,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Bethesda,	1
having	1
five	1
porches.	1
	1
5:3	1
In	1
these	1
lay	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
impotent	1
folk,	1
of	1
blind,	1
halt,	1
withered,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
moving	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
an	1
angel	1
went	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
season	1
into	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
water:	1
whosoever	1
then	1
first	1
after	1
the	1
troubling	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
stepped	1
in	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
disease	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
there,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
infirmity	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
5:6	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
him	1
lie,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
made	1
whole?	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
impotent	1
man	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man,	1
when	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
troubled,	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
pool:	1
but	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
coming,	1
another	1
steppeth	1
down	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
made	1
whole,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
walked:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
cured,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
carry	1
thy	1
bed.	1
	1
5:11	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
whole,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:12	1
Then	1
asked	1
they	1
him,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
healed	1
wist	1
not	1
who	1
it	1
was:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
had	1
conveyed	1
himself	1
away,	1
a	1
multitude	1
being	1
in	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
5:14	1
Afterward	1
Jesus	1
findeth	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
made	1
whole:	1
sin	1
no	1
more,	1
lest	1
a	1
worse	1
thing	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
The	1
man	1
departed,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
whole.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
therefore	1
did	1
the	1
Jews	1
persecute	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
My	1
Father	1
worketh	1
hitherto,	1
and	1
I	1
work.	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
but	1
said	1
also	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
his	1
Father,	1
making	1
himself	1
equal	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
5:19	1
Then	1
answered	1
Jesus	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
Son	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
himself,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
Father	1
do:	1
for	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
he	1
doeth,	1
these	1
also	1
doeth	1
the	1
Son	1
likewise.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
himself	1
doeth:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
quickeneth	1
them;	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
Son	1
quickeneth	1
whom	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
judgeth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
hath	1
committed	1
all	1
judgment	1
unto	1
the	1
Son:	1
5:23	1
That	1
all	1
men	1
should	1
honour	1
the	1
Son,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
honour	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
He	1
that	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
5:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
condemnation;	1
but	1
is	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
5:25	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
have	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
5:27	1
And	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
authority	1
to	1
execute	1
judgment	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
5:28	1
Marvel	1
not	1
at	1
this:	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
graves	1
shall	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
5:29	1
And	1
shall	1
come	1
forth;	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
good,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
evil,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
damnation.	1
	1
5:30	1
I	1
can	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
do	1
nothing:	1
as	1
I	1
hear,	1
I	1
judge:	1
and	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
just;	1
because	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:31	1
If	1
I	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
my	1
witness	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
5:32	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
witness	1
which	1
he	1
witnesseth	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
5:33	1
Ye	1
sent	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
testimony	1
from	1
man:	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
5:35	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
burning	1
and	1
a	1
shining	1
light:	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
willing	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
light.	1
	1
5:36	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
greater	1
witness	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
John:	1
for	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
finish,	1
the	1
same	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
the	1
Father	1
himself,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
Ye	1
have	1
neither	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
nor	1
seen	1
his	1
shape.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
his	1
word	1
abiding	1
in	1
you:	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent,	1
him	1
ye	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
5:39	1
Search	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
ye	1
think	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
testify	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life.	1
	1
5:41	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
honour	1
from	1
men.	1
	1
5:42	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
5:43	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
me	1
not:	1
if	1
another	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
him	1
ye	1
will	1
receive.	1
	1
5:44	1
How	1
can	1
ye	1
believe,	1
which	1
receive	1
honour	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
seek	1
not	1
the	1
honour	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
5:45	1
Do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
accuse	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Father:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
accuseth	1
you,	1
even	1
Moses,	1
in	1
whom	1
ye	1
trust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
had	1
ye	1
believed	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
believed	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
wrote	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:47	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
his	1
writings,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe	1
my	1
words?	1
	1
6:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
diseased.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
passover,	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
nigh.	1
	1
6:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Whence	1
shall	1
we	1
buy	1
bread,	1
that	1
these	1
may	1
eat?	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
prove	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
himself	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
	1
6:7	1
Philip	1
answered	1
him,	1
Two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
take	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
6:8	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
6:9	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lad	1
here,	1
which	1
hath	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
small	1
fishes:	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
so	1
many?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Make	1
the	1
men	1
sit	1
down.	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
So	1
the	1
men	1
sat	1
down,	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
took	1
the	1
loaves;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
distributed	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
set	1
down;	1
and	1
likewise	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
6:12	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Gather	1
up	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remain,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
lost.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
they	1
gathered	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
filled	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
with	1
the	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
which	1
remained	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
eaten.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
those	1
men,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
that	1
prophet	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
king,	1
he	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
himself	1
alone.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
6:17	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
toward	1
Capernaum.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
dark,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
arose	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
that	1
blew.	1
	1
6:19	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
rowed	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
furlongs,	1
they	1
see	1
Jesus	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:20	1
But	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
they	1
willingly	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
day	1
following,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
boat	1
there,	1
save	1
that	1
one	1
whereinto	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
entered,	1
and	1
that	1
Jesus	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
boat,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
alone;	1
6:23	1
(Howbeit	1
there	1
came	1
other	1
boats	1
from	1
Tiberias	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
given	1
thanks:)	1
6:24	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
saw	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
neither	1
his	1
disciples,	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
shipping,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
seeking	1
for	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
when	1
camest	1
thou	1
hither?	1
	1
6:26	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
not	1
because	1
ye	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:27	1
Labour	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
which	1
perisheth,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
meat	1
which	1
endureth	1
unto	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
him	1
hath	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
sealed.	1
	1
6:28	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
6:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent.	1
	1
6:30	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
then,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
believe	1
thee?	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
work?	1
	1
6:31	1
Our	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
gave	1
them	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Moses	1
gave	1
you	1
not	1
that	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven;	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
giveth	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:33	1
For	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
giveth	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:34	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
evermore	1
give	1
us	1
this	1
bread.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
hunger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst.	1
	1
6:36	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
seen	1
me,	1
and	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
6:37	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
giveth	1
me	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
6:38	1
For	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Father's	1
will	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
nothing,	1
but	1
should	1
raise	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
seeth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him,	1
may	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:41	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
murmured	1
at	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
whose	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
we	1
know?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven?	1
	1
6:43	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Murmur	1
not	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
6:44	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
except	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
draw	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:45	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
taught	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
Every	1
man	1
therefore	1
that	1
hath	1
heard,	1
and	1
hath	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
cometh	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
6:46	1
Not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
6:47	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:48	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
bread	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:49	1
Your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
are	1
dead.	1
	1
6:50	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
and	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
6:51	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
living	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
this	1
bread,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
is	1
my	1
flesh,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:52	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
strove	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
How	1
can	1
this	1
man	1
give	1
us	1
his	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:53	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
drink	1
his	1
blood,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
6:54	1
Whoso	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:55	1
For	1
my	1
flesh	1
is	1
meat	1
indeed,	1
and	1
my	1
blood	1
is	1
drink	1
indeed.	1
	1
6:56	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:57	1
As	1
the	1
living	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
Father:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
me,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
6:58	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna,	1
and	1
are	1
dead:	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
this	1
bread	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:59	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
6:60	1
Many	1
therefore	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
this,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
hard	1
saying;	1
who	1
can	1
hear	1
it?	1
	1
6:61	1
When	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
murmured	1
at	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Doth	1
this	1
offend	1
you?	1
	1
6:62	1
What	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
ascend	1
up	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
before?	1
	1
6:63	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
quickeneth;	1
the	1
flesh	1
profiteth	1
nothing:	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
they	1
are	1
spirit,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
life.	1
	1
6:64	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
not.	1
For	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
and	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
6:65	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
6:66	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
back,	1
and	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:67	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
twelve,	1
Will	1
ye	1
also	1
go	1
away?	1
	1
6:68	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
to	1
whom	1
shall	1
we	1
go?	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:69	1
And	1
we	1
believe	1
and	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
6:70	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
chosen	1
you	1
twelve,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
6:71	1
He	1
spake	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon:	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
7:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
Galilee:	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
Jewry,	1
because	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
7:2	1
Now	1
the	1
Jew's	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles	1
was	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
7:3	1
His	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Depart	1
hence,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
that	1
thy	1
disciples	1
also	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
openly.	1
If	1
thou	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
neither	1
did	1
his	1
brethren	1
believe	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come:	1
but	1
your	1
time	1
is	1
alway	1
ready.	1
	1
7:7	1
The	1
world	1
cannot	1
hate	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
it	1
hateth,	1
because	1
I	1
testify	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
thereof	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
7:8	1
Go	1
ye	1
up	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
up	1
yet	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
for	1
my	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
full	1
come.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
abode	1
still	1
in	1
Galilee.	1
	1
7:10	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
gone	1
up,	1
then	1
went	1
he	1
also	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
openly,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
7:11	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
feast,	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
7:12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
murmuring	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
him:	1
for	1
some	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man:	1
others	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
7:13	1
Howbeit	1
no	1
man	1
spake	1
openly	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
7:14	1
Now	1
about	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
knoweth	1
this	1
man	1
letters,	1
having	1
never	1
learned?	1
	1
7:16	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
doctrine	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
his	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
myself.	1
	1
7:18	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
of	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
his	1
own	1
glory:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
his	1
glory	1
that	1
sent	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:19	1
Did	1
not	1
Moses	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
keepeth	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
Why	1
go	1
ye	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me?	1
	1
7:20	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil:	1
who	1
goeth	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
thee?	1
	1
7:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
one	1
work,	1
and	1
ye	1
all	1
marvel.	1
	1
7:22	1
Moses	1
therefore	1
gave	1
unto	1
you	1
circumcision;	1
(not	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
Moses,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
fathers;)	1
and	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
circumcise	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
7:23	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
receive	1
circumcision,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
broken;	1
are	1
ye	1
angry	1
at	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
man	1
every	1
whit	1
whole	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
7:24	1
Judge	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
appearance,	1
but	1
judge	1
righteous	1
judgment.	1
	1
7:25	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he,	1
whom	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
kill?	1
	1
7:26	1
But,	1
lo,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
boldly,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
nothing	1
unto	1
him.	1
Do	1
the	1
rulers	1
know	1
indeed	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Christ?	1
7:27	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
man	1
whence	1
he	1
is:	1
but	1
when	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
7:28	1
Then	1
cried	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
as	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
both	1
know	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:30	1
Then	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
more	1
miracles	1
than	1
these	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done?	1
7:32	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
such	1
things	1
concerning	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
sent	1
officers	1
to	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:34	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
7:35	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Whither	1
will	1
he	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him?	1
will	1
he	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
dispersed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
teach	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
7:36	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
saying	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come?	1
	1
7:37	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
thirst,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
7:38	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
said,	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly	1
shall	1
flow	1
rivers	1
of	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
7:39	1
(But	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
should	1
receive:	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
given;	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
glorified.)	1
	1
7:40	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying,	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Prophet.	1
	1
7:41	1
Others	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
Christ.	1
But	1
some	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Christ	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
7:42	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
scripture	1
said,	1
That	1
Christ	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
where	1
David	1
was?	1
	1
7:43	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
7:45	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
brought	1
him?	1
	1
7:46	1
The	1
officers	1
answered,	1
Never	1
man	1
spake	1
like	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
7:47	1
Then	1
answered	1
them	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
deceived?	1
	1
7:48	1
Have	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
believed	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
7:49	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
cursed.	1
	1
7:50	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
(he	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
them,)	1
7:51	1
Doth	1
our	1
law	1
judge	1
any	1
man,	1
before	1
it	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
doeth?	1
	1
7:52	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
Search,	1
and	1
look:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee	1
ariseth	1
no	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:53	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:1	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
8:4	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act.	1
	1
8:5	1
Now	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
commanded	1
us,	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
be	1
stoned:	1
but	1
what	1
sayest	1
thou?	1
	1
8:6	1
This	1
they	1
said,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
8:7	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
continued	1
asking	1
him,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
without	1
sin	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
first	1
cast	1
a	1
stone	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
heard	1
it,	1
being	1
convicted	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
conscience,	1
went	1
out	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
last:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
saw	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
woman,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
where	1
are	1
those	1
thine	1
accusers?	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
condemned	1
thee?	1
	1
8:11	1
She	1
said,	1
No	1
man,	1
Lord.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
thee:	1
go,	1
and	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
me	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
but	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
bearest	1
record	1
of	1
thyself;	1
thy	1
record	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
8:14	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
of	1
myself,	1
yet	1
my	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go;	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
tell	1
whence	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
8:15	1
Ye	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
I	1
judge	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
I	1
judge,	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
that	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
two	1
men	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
8:18	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
Father?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Ye	1
neither	1
know	1
me,	1
nor	1
my	1
Father:	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
8:20	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
treasury,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Will	1
he	1
kill	1
himself?	1
because	1
he	1
saith,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
from	1
beneath;	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
above:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
world;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
8:24	1
I	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
8:25	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Even	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
8:26	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true;	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:27	1
They	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
8:28	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
taught	1
me,	1
I	1
speak	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
me	1
alone;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
always	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
him.	1
	1
8:30	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
those	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
my	1
word,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
my	1
disciples	1
indeed;	1
8:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free.	1
	1
8:33	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
were	1
never	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
free?	1
	1
8:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:35	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
abideth	1
ever.	1
	1
8:36	1
If	1
the	1
Son	1
therefore	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
indeed.	1
	1
8:37	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
Abraham's	1
seed;	1
but	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
word	1
hath	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:38	1
I	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
8:39	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham	1
is	1
our	1
father.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
Abraham's	1
children,	1
ye	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
God:	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:41	1
Ye	1
do	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
father.	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
born	1
of	1
fornication;	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
Father,	1
even	1
God.	1
	1
8:42	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
God	1
were	1
your	1
Father,	1
ye	1
would	1
love	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
God;	1
neither	1
came	1
I	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:43	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
understand	1
my	1
speech?	1
even	1
because	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hear	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
8:44	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
ye	1
will	1
do.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
abode	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
truth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
speaketh	1
a	1
lie,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
of	1
his	1
own:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
ye	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:46	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
convinceth	1
me	1
of	1
sin?	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
me?	1
	1
8:47	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
God's	1
words:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
hear	1
them	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:48	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
we	1
not	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Samaritan,	1
and	1
hast	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
8:49	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
devil;	1
but	1
I	1
honour	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
dishonour	1
me.	1
	1
8:50	1
And	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
glory:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
seeketh	1
and	1
judgeth.	1
	1
8:51	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
death.	1
	1
8:52	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
Abraham	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
and	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
taste	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
8:53	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
is	1
dead?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
dead:	1
whom	1
makest	1
thou	1
thyself?	1
	1
8:54	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
If	1
I	1
honour	1
myself,	1
my	1
honour	1
is	1
nothing:	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
that	1
honoureth	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
God:	1
8:55	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
like	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
saying.	1
	1
8:56	1
Your	1
father	1
Abraham	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
day:	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
8:57	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
yet	1
fifty	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
Abraham?	1
	1
8:58	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Before	1
Abraham	1
was,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
8:59	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
up	1
stones	1
to	1
cast	1
at	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
hid	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
blind	1
from	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
who	1
did	1
sin,	1
this	1
man,	1
or	1
his	1
parents,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
	1
9:3	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
sinned,	1
nor	1
his	1
parents:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:4	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
day:	1
the	1
night	1
cometh,	1
when	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
work.	1
	1
9:5	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
9:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
made	1
clay	1
of	1
the	1
spittle,	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
clay,	1
9:7	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
wash	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
(which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
Sent.)	1
He	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
therefore,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
came	1
seeing.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
neighbours	1
therefore,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
before	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
blind,	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
and	1
begged?	1
	1
9:9	1
Some	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
he:	1
others	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
9:10	1
Therefore	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
were	1
thine	1
eyes	1
opened?	1
	1
9:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Jesus	1
made	1
clay,	1
and	1
anointed	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
and	1
wash:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
I	1
received	1
sight.	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
9:13	1
They	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
him	1
that	1
aforetime	1
was	1
blind.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
when	1
Jesus	1
made	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:15	1
Then	1
again	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
put	1
clay	1
upon	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
washed,	1
and	1
do	1
see.	1
	1
9:16	1
Therefore	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
keepeth	1
not	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
Others	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner	1
do	1
such	1
miracles?	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
again,	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
He	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
blind,	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
until	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
ye	1
say	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
how	1
then	1
doth	1
he	1
now	1
see?	1
	1
9:20	1
His	1
parents	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind:	1
9:21	1
But	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
now	1
seeth,	1
we	1
know	1
not;	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
we	1
know	1
not:	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:22	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
agreed	1
already,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
did	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
9:23	1
Therefore	1
said	1
his	1
parents,	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:24	1
Then	1
again	1
called	1
they	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
blind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
God	1
the	1
praise:	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
9:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sinner	1
or	1
no,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
know,	1
that,	1
whereas	1
I	1
was	1
blind,	1
now	1
I	1
see.	1
	1
9:26	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him	1
again,	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
to	1
thee?	1
how	1
opened	1
he	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
	1
9:27	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,	1
and	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
wherefore	1
would	1
ye	1
hear	1
it	1
again?	1
will	1
ye	1
also	1
be	1
his	1
disciples?	1
	1
9:28	1
Then	1
they	1
reviled	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
his	1
disciple;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
Moses'	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:29	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
fellow,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
9:30	1
The	1
man	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
herein	1
is	1
a	1
marvellous	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:31	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
sinners:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
doeth	1
his	1
will,	1
him	1
he	1
heareth.	1
	1
9:32	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
heard	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
blind.	1
	1
9:33	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
9:34	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wast	1
altogether	1
born	1
in	1
sins,	1
and	1
dost	1
thou	1
teach	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
9:35	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
9:36	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
he,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
believe	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
both	1
seen	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
talketh	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
For	1
judgment	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
not	1
might	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
blind.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Are	1
we	1
blind	1
also?	1
	1
9:41	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
blind,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
see;	1
therefore	1
your	1
sin	1
remaineth.	1
	1
10:1	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
entereth	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sheepfold,	1
but	1
climbeth	1
up	1
some	1
other	1
way,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
10:2	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:3	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
porter	1
openeth;	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
hear	1
his	1
voice:	1
and	1
he	1
calleth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
putteth	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
follow	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
a	1
stranger	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
follow,	1
but	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
strangers.	1
	1
10:6	1
This	1
parable	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
were	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
again,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:8	1
All	1
that	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me	1
are	1
thieves	1
and	1
robbers:	1
but	1
the	1
sheep	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:9	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door:	1
by	1
me	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
enter	1
in,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out,	1
and	1
find	1
pasture.	1
	1
10:10	1
The	1
thief	1
cometh	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
to	1
steal,	1
and	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
abundantly.	1
	1
10:11	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd:	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
giveth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
whose	1
own	1
the	1
sheep	1
are	1
not,	1
seeth	1
the	1
wolf	1
coming,	1
and	1
leaveth	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
fleeth:	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
catcheth	1
them,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:13	1
The	1
hireling	1
fleeth,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
careth	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:14	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
am	1
known	1
of	1
mine.	1
	1
10:15	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
know	1
I	1
the	1
Father:	1
and	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
fold:	1
them	1
also	1
I	1
must	1
bring,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold,	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:17	1
Therefore	1
doth	1
my	1
Father	1
love	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
10:18	1
No	1
man	1
taketh	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
This	1
commandment	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
10:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
therefore	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
for	1
these	1
sayings.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
is	1
mad;	1
why	1
hear	1
ye	1
him?	1
	1
10:21	1
Others	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
Can	1
a	1
devil	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
dedication,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
winter.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
10:24	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
Jews	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
dost	1
thou	1
make	1
us	1
to	1
doubt?	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
tell	1
us	1
plainly.	1
	1
10:25	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
not:	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
they	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
sheep,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:27	1
My	1
sheep	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
follow	1
me:	1
10:28	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
perish,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
10:29	1
My	1
Father,	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
me,	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Father's	1
hand.	1
	1
10:30	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
10:31	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
up	1
stones	1
again	1
to	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
10:32	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Many	1
good	1
works	1
have	1
I	1
shewed	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
Father;	1
for	1
which	1
of	1
those	1
works	1
do	1
ye	1
stone	1
me?	1
	1
10:33	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
we	1
stone	1
thee	1
not;	1
but	1
for	1
blasphemy;	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
man,	1
makest	1
thyself	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
I	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
gods?	1
	1
10:35	1
If	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
gods,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
scripture	1
cannot	1
be	1
broken;	1
10:36	1
Say	1
ye	1
of	1
him,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
Thou	1
blasphemest;	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
10:37	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
do,	1
though	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
me,	1
believe	1
the	1
works:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know,	1
and	1
believe,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sought	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand,	1
10:40	1
And	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
John	1
at	1
first	1
baptized;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
abode.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
many	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
John	1
did	1
no	1
miracle:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
John	1
spake	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
true.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
sick,	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
of	1
Bethany,	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
Martha.	1
	1
11:2	1
(It	1
was	1
that	1
Mary	1
which	1
anointed	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair,	1
whose	1
brother	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
sick.)	1
	1
11:3	1
Therefore	1
his	1
sisters	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
11:4	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
sickness	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
glorified	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:5	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
Martha,	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
Lazarus.	1
	1
11:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
he	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
11:7	1
Then	1
after	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea	1
again.	1
	1
11:8	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
late	1
sought	1
to	1
stone	1
thee;	1
and	1
goest	1
thou	1
thither	1
again?	1
	1
11:9	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
twelve	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
he	1
stumbleth	1
not,	1
because	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
stumbleth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
11:11	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Our	1
friend	1
Lazarus	1
sleepeth;	1
but	1
I	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
awake	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
he	1
sleep,	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
11:13	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
taking	1
of	1
rest	1
in	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
plainly,	1
Lazarus	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
ye	1
may	1
believe;	1
nevertheless	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Thomas,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
unto	1
his	1
fellowdisciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
also	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
die	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:17	1
Then	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
four	1
days	1
already.	1
	1
11:18	1
Now	1
Bethany	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
furlongs	1
off:	1
11:19	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
came	1
to	1
Martha	1
and	1
Mary,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
brother.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
Martha,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming,	1
went	1
and	1
met	1
him:	1
but	1
Mary	1
sat	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
11:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Martha	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
11:23	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
Martha	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
11:25	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
in	1
me,	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
dead,	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
live:	1
11:26	1
And	1
whosoever	1
liveth	1
and	1
believeth	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
die.	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this?	1
	1
11:27	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord:	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
she	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
called	1
Mary	1
her	1
sister	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Master	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
calleth	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:29	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that,	1
she	1
arose	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:30	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
where	1
Martha	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
comforted	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Mary,	1
that	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
hastily	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
followed	1
her,	1
saying,	1
She	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
grave	1
to	1
weep	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
Then	1
when	1
Mary	1
was	1
come	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:33	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
her	1
weeping,	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
weeping	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
groaned	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
troubled.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
said,	1
Where	1
have	1
ye	1
laid	1
him?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
11:35	1
Jesus	1
wept.	1
	1
11:36	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
how	1
he	1
loved	1
him!	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
Could	1
not	1
this	1
man,	1
which	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
even	1
this	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
died?	1
	1
11:38	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
again	1
groaning	1
in	1
himself	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
a	1
stone	1
lay	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:39	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Take	1
ye	1
away	1
the	1
stone.	1
Martha,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
dead,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
stinketh:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
dead	1
four	1
days.	1
	1
11:40	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Said	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
believe,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
11:41	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
dead	1
was	1
laid.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me.	1
	1
11:42	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
hearest	1
me	1
always:	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stand	1
by	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
11:43	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thus	1
had	1
spoken,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lazarus,	1
come	1
forth.	1
	1
11:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
came	1
forth,	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
with	1
graveclothes:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
bound	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
napkin.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Loose	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Mary,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
11:46	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
11:47	1
Then	1
gathered	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
do	1
we?	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
doeth	1
many	1
miracles.	1
	1
11:48	1
If	1
we	1
let	1
him	1
thus	1
alone,	1
all	1
men	1
will	1
believe	1
on	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Romans	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
both	1
our	1
place	1
and	1
nation.	1
	1
11:49	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
named	1
Caiaphas,	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
11:50	1
Nor	1
consider	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
11:51	1
And	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
of	1
himself:	1
but	1
being	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
year,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
that	1
Jesus	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
that	1
nation;	1
11:52	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
nation	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
also	1
he	1
should	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
11:53	1
Then	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
they	1
took	1
counsel	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:54	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
among	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
went	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
country	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
there	1
continued	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:55	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand:	1
and	1
many	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
before	1
the	1
passover,	1
to	1
purify	1
themselves.	1
	1
11:56	1
Then	1
sought	1
they	1
for	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
What	1
think	1
ye,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast?	1
	1
11:57	1
Now	1
both	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
commandment,	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
were,	1
he	1
should	1
shew	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
six	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
passover	1
came	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
where	1
Lazarus	1
was,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dead,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:2	1
There	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
supper;	1
and	1
Martha	1
served:	1
but	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
Then	1
took	1
Mary	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard,	1
very	1
costly,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
saith	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
which	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
12:5	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
ointment	1
sold	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor?	1
	1
12:6	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
poor;	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
bare	1
what	1
was	1
put	1
therein.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone:	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
burying	1
hath	1
she	1
kept	1
this.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
ye	1
have	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
12:9	1
Much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
see	1
Lazarus	1
also,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:10	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
Lazarus	1
also	1
to	1
death;	1
12:11	1
Because	1
that	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
believed	1
on	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:12	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
much	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
12:13	1
Took	1
branches	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
Hosanna:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
young	1
ass,	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
12:15	1
Fear	1
not,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh,	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
ass's	1
colt.	1
	1
12:16	1
These	1
things	1
understood	1
not	1
his	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
but	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
glorified,	1
then	1
remembered	1
they	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:17	1
The	1
people	1
therefore	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
Lazarus	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grave,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
bare	1
record.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
met	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
miracle.	1
	1
12:19	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Perceive	1
ye	1
how	1
ye	1
prevail	1
nothing?	1
behold,	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
gone	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
Greeks	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
12:21	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
therefore	1
to	1
Philip,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
desired	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:22	1
Philip	1
cometh	1
and	1
telleth	1
Andrew:	1
and	1
again	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Philip	1
tell	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
come,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
12:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
a	1
corn	1
of	1
wheat	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
die,	1
it	1
abideth	1
alone:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
die,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:25	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
follow	1
me;	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
my	1
servant	1
be:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
my	1
Father	1
honour.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
is	1
my	1
soul	1
troubled;	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
Father,	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
hour:	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
this	1
hour.	1
	1
12:28	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name.	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
glorified	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
glorify	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
12:29	1
The	1
people	1
therefore,	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
thundered:	1
others	1
said,	1
An	1
angel	1
spake	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:30	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
voice	1
came	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes.	1
	1
12:31	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
now	1
shall	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
be	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
I,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
will	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
12:33	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
12:34	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
Christ	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
lifted	1
up?	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Son	1
of	1
man?	1
	1
12:35	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
Walk	1
while	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
darkness	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth.	1
	1
12:36	1
While	1
ye	1
have	1
light,	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
These	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
did	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
12:37	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
many	1
miracles	1
before	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
on	1
him:	1
12:38	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
hath	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
been	1
revealed?	1
	1
12:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
believe,	1
because	1
that	1
Esaias	1
said	1
again,	1
12:40	1
He	1
hath	1
blinded	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
heart;	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
nor	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
12:41	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
Esaias,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
12:42	1
Nevertheless	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
rulers	1
also	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him;	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
him,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
12:43	1
For	1
they	1
loved	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:44	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
believeth	1
not	1
on	1
me,	1
but	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:45	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
seeth	1
me	1
seeth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:46	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
a	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
should	1
not	1
abide	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
believe	1
not,	1
I	1
judge	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
12:48	1
He	1
that	1
rejecteth	1
me,	1
and	1
receiveth	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
hath	1
one	1
that	1
judgeth	1
him:	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
judge	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
12:49	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
sent	1
me,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
commandment,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
speak.	1
	1
12:50	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
commandment	1
is	1
life	1
everlasting:	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
speak	1
therefore,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
before	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
having	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
loved	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
supper	1
being	1
ended,	1
the	1
devil	1
having	1
now	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
to	1
betray	1
him;	1
13:3	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
had	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
God;	1
13:4	1
He	1
riseth	1
from	1
supper,	1
and	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
garments;	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
girded	1
himself.	1
	1
13:5	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
poureth	1
water	1
into	1
a	1
bason,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
disciples'	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
towel	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
girded.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter:	1
and	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
wash	1
my	1
feet?	1
	1
13:7	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
I	1
do	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
hereafter.	1
	1
13:8	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
wash	1
my	1
feet.	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
wash	1
thee	1
not,	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
part	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
13:9	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
not	1
my	1
feet	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
13:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
washed	1
needeth	1
not	1
save	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
but	1
is	1
clean	1
every	1
whit:	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
clean,	1
but	1
not	1
all.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him;	1
therefore	1
said	1
he,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
clean.	1
	1
13:12	1
So	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
again,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
13:13	1
Ye	1
call	1
me	1
Master	1
and	1
Lord:	1
and	1
ye	1
say	1
well;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:14	1
If	1
I	1
then,	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
Master,	1
have	1
washed	1
your	1
feet;	1
ye	1
also	1
ought	1
to	1
wash	1
one	1
another's	1
feet.	1
	1
13:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:16	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord;	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
sent	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
13:17	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
you	1
all:	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
bread	1
with	1
me	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
heel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
13:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
send	1
receiveth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
13:21	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified,	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
13:22	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
looked	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
doubting	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:23	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
leaning	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
bosom	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved.	1
	1
13:24	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:25	1
He	1
then	1
lying	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
breast	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
13:26	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
sop,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
dipped	1
it.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
dipped	1
the	1
sop,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
sop	1
Satan	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
That	1
thou	1
doest,	1
do	1
quickly.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
no	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:29	1
For	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thought,	1
because	1
Judas	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Buy	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
against	1
the	1
feast;	1
or,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
13:30	1
He	1
then	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sop	1
went	1
immediately	1
out:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
night.	1
	1
13:31	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
glorified,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
glorified	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
13:32	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
also	1
glorify	1
him	1
in	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
straightway	1
glorify	1
him.	1
	1
13:33	1
Little	1
children,	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you.	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come;	1
so	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:34	1
A	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
13:35	1
By	1
this	1
shall	1
all	1
men	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
disciples,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
love	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
13:36	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
follow	1
me	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
follow	1
me	1
afterwards.	1
	1
13:37	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
why	1
cannot	1
I	1
follow	1
thee	1
now?	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
13:38	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
denied	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:1	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled:	1
ye	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
believe	1
also	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:2	1
In	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
are	1
many	1
mansions:	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
receive	1
you	1
unto	1
myself;	1
that	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
ye	1
know,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
14:5	1
Thomas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest;	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
14:6	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
no	1
man	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also:	1
and	1
from	1
henceforth	1
ye	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
14:8	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known	1
me,	1
Philip?	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
me	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou	1
then,	1
Shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
14:10	1
Believest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
myself:	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
doeth	1
the	1
works.	1
	1
14:11	1
Believe	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me:	1
or	1
else	1
believe	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
works'	1
sake.	1
	1
14:12	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
also;	1
and	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
14:14	1
If	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
14:15	1
If	1
ye	1
love	1
me,	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
another	1
Comforter,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
abide	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
ever;	1
14:17	1
Even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth;	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
cannot	1
receive,	1
because	1
it	1
seeth	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
him:	1
but	1
ye	1
know	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
you	1
comfortless:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
seeth	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
ye	1
see	1
me:	1
because	1
I	1
live,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
also.	1
	1
14:20	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:21	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
them,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
loveth	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
loved	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
manifest	1
myself	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
14:22	1
Judas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
not	1
Iscariot,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
manifest	1
thyself	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
14:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
love	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
words:	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
our	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:24	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
not	1
keepeth	1
not	1
my	1
sayings:	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
hear	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
the	1
Father's	1
which	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
14:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
being	1
yet	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:26	1
But	1
the	1
Comforter,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
will	1
send	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
bring	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
your	1
remembrance,	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:27	1
Peace	1
I	1
leave	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
peace	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
giveth,	1
give	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
how	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
go	1
away,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you.	1
If	1
ye	1
loved	1
me,	1
ye	1
would	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father:	1
for	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
14:30	1
Hereafter	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
talk	1
much	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
cometh,	1
and	1
hath	1
nothing	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
gave	1
me	1
commandment,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do.	1
Arise,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
hence.	1
	1
15:1	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
true	1
vine,	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
the	1
husbandman.	1
	1
15:2	1
Every	1
branch	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
beareth	1
not	1
fruit	1
he	1
taketh	1
away:	1
and	1
every	1
branch	1
that	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
he	1
purgeth	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
more	1
fruit.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
clean	1
through	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:4	1
Abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
As	1
the	1
branch	1
cannot	1
bear	1
fruit	1
of	1
itself,	1
except	1
it	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
vine;	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
15:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
vine,	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
branches:	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit:	1
for	1
without	1
me	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:6	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
abide	1
not	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
cast	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
branch,	1
and	1
is	1
withered;	1
and	1
men	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
burned.	1
	1
15:7	1
If	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
what	1
ye	1
will,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:8	1
Herein	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
glorified,	1
that	1
ye	1
bear	1
much	1
fruit;	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:9	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
loved	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
loved	1
you:	1
continue	1
ye	1
in	1
my	1
love.	1
	1
15:10	1
If	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
my	1
love;	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
Father's	1
commandments,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
15:11	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
might	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
15:12	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
commandment,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you.	1
	1
15:13	1
Greater	1
love	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
his	1
friends.	1
	1
15:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
not	1
servants;	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
not	1
what	1
his	1
lord	1
doeth:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
you	1
friends;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:16	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
chosen	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you,	1
and	1
ordained	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
fruit	1
should	1
remain:	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:18	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
hated	1
me	1
before	1
it	1
hated	1
you.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
love	1
his	1
own:	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
hateth	1
you.	1
	1
15:20	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me,	1
they	1
will	1
also	1
persecute	1
you;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
saying,	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
yours	1
also.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
15:22	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
cloak	1
for	1
their	1
sin.	1
	1
15:23	1
He	1
that	1
hateth	1
me	1
hateth	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
15:24	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
none	1
other	1
man	1
did,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
they	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
hated	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
this	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
law,	1
They	1
hated	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Comforter	1
is	1
come,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
which	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
shall	1
testify	1
of	1
me:	1
15:27	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
bear	1
witness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
16:1	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
16:2	1
They	1
shall	1
put	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues:	1
yea,	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
killeth	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
doeth	1
God	1
service.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
Father,	1
nor	1
me.	1
	1
16:4	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come,	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:5	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
asketh	1
me,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
sorrow	1
hath	1
filled	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
16:7	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth;	1
It	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
away:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
away,	1
the	1
Comforter	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
depart,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
sin,	1
and	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment:	1
16:9	1
Of	1
sin,	1
because	1
they	1
believe	1
not	1
on	1
me;	1
16:10	1
Of	1
righteousness,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
16:11	1
Of	1
judgment,	1
because	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
judged.	1
	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them	1
now.	1
	1
16:13	1
Howbeit	1
when	1
he,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
into	1
all	1
truth:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
himself;	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
hear,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
speak:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
shall	1
glorify	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:15	1
All	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
are	1
mine:	1
therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:16	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:17	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
themselves,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
us,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me:	1
and,	1
Because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
16:18	1
They	1
said	1
therefore,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
little	1
while?	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
16:19	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
enquire	1
among	1
yourselves	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me?	1
	1
16:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
lament,	1
but	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
but	1
your	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
joy.	1
	1
16:21	1
A	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
travail	1
hath	1
sorrow,	1
because	1
her	1
hour	1
is	1
come:	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
delivered	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
she	1
remembereth	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
anguish,	1
for	1
joy	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
ye	1
now	1
therefore	1
have	1
sorrow:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
and	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
me	1
nothing.	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
Hitherto	1
have	1
ye	1
asked	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
ask,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
16:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs:	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
plainly	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:26	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
you:	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
himself	1
loveth	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:28	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world:	1
again,	1
I	1
leave	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:29	1
His	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
now	1
speakest	1
thou	1
plainly,	1
and	1
speakest	1
no	1
proverb.	1
	1
16:30	1
Now	1
are	1
we	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
needest	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
ask	1
thee:	1
by	1
this	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:31	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
now	1
believe?	1
	1
16:32	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
yea,	1
is	1
now	1
come,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
me	1
alone:	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
because	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:33	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
world	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation:	1
but	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
I	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:1	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
glorify	1
thy	1
Son,	1
that	1
thy	1
Son	1
also	1
may	1
glorify	1
thee:	1
17:2	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
power	1
over	1
all	1
flesh,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
eternal	1
life	1
to	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
eternal,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
thee	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent.	1
	1
17:4	1
I	1
have	1
glorified	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thou	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
was.	1
	1
17:6	1
I	1
have	1
manifested	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
thine	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
17:7	1
Now	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
surely	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
all	1
mine	1
are	1
thine,	1
and	1
thine	1
are	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
glorified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
keep	1
through	1
thine	1
own	1
name	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
are.	1
	1
17:12	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
name:	1
those	1
that	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
kept,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
now	1
come	1
I	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
my	1
joy	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
themselves.	1
	1
17:14	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
thy	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
hated	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:15	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
17:16	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:17	1
Sanctify	1
them	1
through	1
thy	1
truth:	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
17:18	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
I	1
sanctify	1
myself,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
might	1
be	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
17:20	1
Neither	1
pray	1
I	1
for	1
these	1
alone,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
me	1
through	1
their	1
word;	1
17:21	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
one;	1
as	1
thou,	1
Father,	1
art	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
us:	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
one:	1
17:23	1
I	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
one;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
loved	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me.	1
	1
17:24	1
Father,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
they	1
also,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
am;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
behold	1
my	1
glory,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:25	1
O	1
righteous	1
Father,	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
not	1
known	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
thee,	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
will	1
declare	1
it:	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Cedron,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
garden,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
entered,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
knew	1
the	1
place:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
ofttimes	1
resorted	1
thither	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:3	1
Judas	1
then,	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
cometh	1
thither	1
with	1
lanterns	1
and	1
torches	1
and	1
weapons.	1
	1
18:4	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
knowing	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
	1
18:5	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
stood	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:6	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
they	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
asked	1
he	1
them	1
again,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
18:8	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
if	1
therefore	1
ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
let	1
these	1
go	1
their	1
way:	1
18:9	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Of	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
have	1
I	1
lost	1
none.	1
	1
18:10	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
having	1
a	1
sword	1
drew	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
servant,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
The	1
servant's	1
name	1
was	1
Malchus.	1
	1
18:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Put	1
up	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
sheath:	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
drink	1
it?	1
	1
18:12	1
Then	1
the	1
band	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
18:13	1
And	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Annas	1
first;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
Caiaphas,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year.	1
	1
18:14	1
Now	1
Caiaphas	1
was	1
he,	1
which	1
gave	1
counsel	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
followed	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
another	1
disciple:	1
that	1
disciple	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
without.	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
Peter.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
damsel	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
man's	1
disciples?	1
He	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
officers	1
stood	1
there,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cold:	1
and	1
they	1
warmed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
Peter	1
stood	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
	1
18:19	1
The	1
high	1
priest	1
then	1
asked	1
Jesus	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
18:20	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
spake	1
openly	1
to	1
the	1
world;	1
I	1
ever	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
whither	1
the	1
Jews	1
always	1
resort;	1
and	1
in	1
secret	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
18:21	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
me?	1
ask	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
me,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
behold,	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
which	1
stood	1
by	1
struck	1
Jesus	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
so?	1
	1
18:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
evil,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
well,	1
why	1
smitest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
18:24	1
Now	1
Annas	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
bound	1
unto	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
stood	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples?	1
He	1
denied	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:26	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
being	1
his	1
kinsman	1
whose	1
ear	1
Peter	1
cut	1
off,	1
saith,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
him?	1
18:27	1
Peter	1
then	1
denied	1
again:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
led	1
they	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Caiaphas	1
unto	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
judgment:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
early;	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
went	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
defiled;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
eat	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
18:29	1
Pilate	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
accusation	1
bring	1
ye	1
against	1
this	1
man?	1
	1
18:30	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
malefactor,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
judge	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
law.	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
put	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
death:	1
18:32	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
18:33	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall	1
again,	1
and	1
called	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sayest	1
thou	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
thyself,	1
or	1
did	1
others	1
tell	1
it	1
thee	1
of	1
me?	1
	1
18:35	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
Jew?	1
Thine	1
own	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
have	1
delivered	1
thee	1
unto	1
me:	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
18:36	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
My	1
kingdom	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
if	1
my	1
kingdom	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
then	1
would	1
my	1
servants	1
fight,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Jews:	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
my	1
kingdom	1
not	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
18:37	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
king	1
then?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
king.	1
To	1
this	1
end	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
heareth	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
18:38	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
truth?	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
fault	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:39	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
a	1
custom,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
passover:	1
will	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:40	1
Then	1
cried	1
they	1
all	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
this	1
man,	1
but	1
Barabbas.	1
Now	1
Barabbas	1
was	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
19:1	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
scourged	1
him.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
purple	1
robe,	1
19:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
19:4	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:5	1
Then	1
came	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
wearing	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
purple	1
robe.	1
And	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man!	1
	1
19:6	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
therefore	1
and	1
officers	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
crucify	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:8	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
afraid;	1
19:9	1
And	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
But	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Speakest	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
me?	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
crucify	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
release	1
thee?	1
	1
19:11	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
couldest	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
thee	1
from	1
above:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
unto	1
thee	1
hath	1
the	1
greater	1
sin.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
Pilate	1
sought	1
to	1
release	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
Jews	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
go,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
Caesar's	1
friend:	1
whosoever	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
speaketh	1
against	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:13	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
brought	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Pavement,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew,	1
Gabbatha.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
your	1
King!	1
	1
19:15	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
Away	1
with	1
him,	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
I	1
crucify	1
your	1
King?	1
The	1
chief	1
priests	1
answered,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
but	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
delivered	1
he	1
him	1
therefore	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
bearing	1
his	1
cross	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
Golgotha:	1
19:18	1
Where	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
with	1
him,	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
one,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
Pilate	1
wrote	1
a	1
title,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
cross.	1
And	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
JESUS	1
OF	1
NAZARETH	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
19:20	1
This	1
title	1
then	1
read	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was	1
crucified	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew,	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin.	1
	1
19:21	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
Write	1
not,	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
19:22	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
I	1
have	1
written.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
Jesus,	1
took	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
made	1
four	1
parts,	1
to	1
every	1
soldier	1
a	1
part;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
coat:	1
now	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
without	1
seam,	1
woven	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
throughout.	1
	1
19:24	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
rend	1
it,	1
but	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
it,	1
whose	1
it	1
shall	1
be:	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
raiment	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
vesture	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
lots.	1
These	1
things	1
therefore	1
the	1
soldiers	1
did.	1
	1
19:25	1
Now	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Jesus	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
Mary	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Cleophas,	1
and	1
Mary	1
Magdalene.	1
	1
19:26	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
disciple	1
standing	1
by,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
Woman,	1
behold	1
thy	1
son!	1
19:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
disciple,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
mother!	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
that	1
disciple	1
took	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
19:28	1
After	1
this,	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
now	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
saith,	1
I	1
thirst.	1
	1
19:29	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
a	1
vessel	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar:	1
and	1
they	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
19:30	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
vinegar,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
finished:	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
19:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
the	1
bodies	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
(for	1
that	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
an	1
high	1
day,)	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
their	1
legs	1
might	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
19:32	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
crucified	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:33	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
already,	1
they	1
brake	1
not	1
his	1
legs:	1
19:34	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
with	1
a	1
spear	1
pierced	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
came	1
there	1
out	1
blood	1
and	1
water.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
bare	1
record,	1
and	1
his	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
true,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
19:36	1
For	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
A	1
bone	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
again	1
another	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
They	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
they	1
pierced.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
being	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
but	1
secretly	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
him	1
leave.	1
He	1
came	1
therefore,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
Nicodemus,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
myrrh	1
and	1
aloes,	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
pound	1
weight.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wound	1
it	1
in	1
linen	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
spices,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
is	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:41	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
garden;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
a	1
new	1
sepulchre,	1
wherein	1
was	1
never	1
man	1
yet	1
laid.	1
	1
19:42	1
There	1
laid	1
they	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews'	1
preparation	1
day;	1
for	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
cometh	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
early,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
dark,	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
stone	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
she	1
runneth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
disciple,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:3	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:4	1
So	1
they	1
ran	1
both	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
disciple	1
did	1
outrun	1
Peter,	1
and	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
he	1
stooping	1
down,	1
and	1
looking	1
in,	1
saw	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lying;	1
yet	1
went	1
he	1
not	1
in.	1
	1
20:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
following	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lie,	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
napkin,	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
not	1
lying	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
but	1
wrapped	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
itself.	1
	1
20:8	1
Then	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
he	1
saw,	1
and	1
believed.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
as	1
yet	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
scripture,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
Mary	1
stood	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
weeping:	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
wept,	1
she	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
20:12	1
And	1
seeth	1
two	1
angels	1
in	1
white	1
sitting,	1
the	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
feet,	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lain.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
she	1
turned	1
herself	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
standing,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
20:15	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
whom	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
She,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
gardener,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
if	1
thou	1
have	1
borne	1
him	1
hence,	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
20:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Mary.	1
She	1
turned	1
herself,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabboni;	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Master.	1
	1
20:17	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Touch	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
ascended	1
to	1
my	1
Father:	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
ascend	1
unto	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
your	1
Father;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:18	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
disciples	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
20:19	1
Then	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
at	1
evening,	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut	1
where	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
assembled	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
he	1
shewed	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
disciples	1
glad,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
send	1
I	1
you.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
breathed	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Receive	1
ye	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
20:23	1
Whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
remit,	1
they	1
are	1
remitted	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
retain,	1
they	1
are	1
retained.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
Thomas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came.	1
	1
20:25	1
The	1
other	1
disciples	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Except	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
side,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
after	1
eight	1
days	1
again	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
within,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
with	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
doors	1
being	1
shut,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
Thomas,	1
Reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
behold	1
my	1
hands;	1
and	1
reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
side:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
faithless,	1
but	1
believing.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Thomas	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
LORD	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
20:29	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thomas,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed:	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
have	1
believed.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
signs	1
truly	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
20:31	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
written,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
that	1
believing	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life	1
through	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
21:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
shewed	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
21:2	1
There	1
were	1
together	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
and	1
Nathanael	1
of	1
Cana	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
21:3	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
a	1
fishing.	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
thee.	1
They	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
immediately;	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
caught	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore:	1
but	1
the	1
disciples	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:5	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
have	1
ye	1
any	1
meat?	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
No.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Cast	1
the	1
net	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find.	1
They	1
cast	1
therefore,	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
that	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Now	1
when	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord,	1
he	1
girt	1
his	1
fisher's	1
coat	1
unto	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
naked,)	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
disciples	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
ship;	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
land,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
cubits,)	1
dragging	1
the	1
net	1
with	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:9	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals	1
there,	1
and	1
fish	1
laid	1
thereon,	1
and	1
bread.	1
	1
21:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
now	1
caught.	1
	1
21:11	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
net	1
to	1
land	1
full	1
of	1
great	1
fishes,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
and	1
three:	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many,	1
yet	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
net	1
broken.	1
	1
21:12	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
dine.	1
And	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
durst	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
21:13	1
Jesus	1
then	1
cometh,	1
and	1
taketh	1
bread,	1
and	1
giveth	1
them,	1
and	1
fish	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:14	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
21:15	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
these?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
lambs.	1
	1
21:16	1
He	1
saith	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:17	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Peter	1
was	1
grieved	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:18	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
young,	1
thou	1
girdest	1
thyself,	1
and	1
walkedst	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest:	1
but	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
old,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hands,	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
gird	1
thee,	1
and	1
carry	1
thee	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not.	1
	1
21:19	1
This	1
spake	1
he,	1
signifying	1
by	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
glorify	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
21:20	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
turning	1
about,	1
seeth	1
the	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
following;	1
which	1
also	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
supper,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
thee?	1
	1
21:21	1
Peter	1
seeing	1
him	1
saith	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
do?	1
	1
21:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
follow	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
21:23	1
Then	1
went	1
this	1
saying	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
that	1
disciple	1
should	1
not	1
die:	1
yet	1
Jesus	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
die;	1
but,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
21:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
disciple	1
which	1
testifieth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
wrote	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
testimony	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
the	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
every	1
one,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
written.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Acts	1
of	1
the	1
Apostles	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
former	1
treatise	1
have	1
I	1
made,	1
O	1
Theophilus,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Jesus	1
began	1
both	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
teach,	1
1:2	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
had	1
given	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen:	1
1:3	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
alive	1
after	1
his	1
passion	1
by	1
many	1
infallible	1
proofs,	1
being	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
1:4	1
And,	1
being	1
assembled	1
together	1
with	1
them,	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
but	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
which,	1
saith	1
he,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
John	1
truly	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
hence.	1
	1
1:6	1
When	1
they	1
therefore	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
they	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
restore	1
again	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
Israel?	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
times	1
or	1
the	1
seasons,	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
power,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
me	1
both	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things,	1
while	1
they	1
beheld,	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up;	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
received	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
looked	1
stedfastly	1
toward	1
heaven	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
white	1
apparel;	1
1:11	1
Which	1
also	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
why	1
stand	1
ye	1
gazing	1
up	1
into	1
heaven?	1
this	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
you	1
into	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
so	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
go	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
returned	1
they	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
Olivet,	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
sabbath	1
day's	1
journey.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
upper	1
room,	1
where	1
abode	1
both	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
Zelotes,	1
and	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
1:14	1
These	1
all	1
continued	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication,	1
with	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
Peter	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
(the	1
number	1
of	1
names	1
together	1
were	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty,)	1
1:16	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
this	1
scripture	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
David	1
spake	1
before	1
concerning	1
Judas,	1
which	1
was	1
guide	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
took	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
had	1
obtained	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
this	1
man	1
purchased	1
a	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
falling	1
headlong,	1
he	1
burst	1
asunder	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bowels	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
dwellers	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
insomuch	1
as	1
that	1
field	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
tongue,	1
Aceldama,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
Let	1
his	1
habitation	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
and	1
his	1
bishoprick	1
let	1
another	1
take.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
companied	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
us,	1
1:22	1
Beginning	1
from	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
unto	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
us,	1
must	1
one	1
be	1
ordained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
with	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
they	1
appointed	1
two,	1
Joseph	1
called	1
Barsabas,	1
who	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Justus,	1
and	1
Matthias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
shew	1
whether	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
1:25	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
from	1
which	1
Judas	1
by	1
transgression	1
fell,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
forth	1
their	1
lots;	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Matthias;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
eleven	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost	1
was	1
fully	1
come,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
from	1
heaven	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
rushing	1
mighty	1
wind,	1
and	1
it	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
cloven	1
tongues	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
sat	1
upon	1
each	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
other	1
tongues,	1
as	1
the	1
Spirit	1
gave	1
them	1
utterance.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Jews,	1
devout	1
men,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
nation	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:6	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
noised	1
abroad,	1
the	1
multitude	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
confounded,	1
because	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
and	1
marvelled,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
which	1
speak	1
Galilaeans?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
how	1
hear	1
we	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
tongue,	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
born?	1
	1
2:9	1
Parthians,	1
and	1
Medes,	1
and	1
Elamites,	1
and	1
the	1
dwellers	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
and	1
in	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Cappadocia,	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
and	1
Asia,	1
2:10	1
Phrygia,	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Libya	1
about	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
strangers	1
of	1
Rome,	1
Jews	1
and	1
proselytes,	1
2:11	1
Cretes	1
and	1
Arabians,	1
we	1
do	1
hear	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
our	1
tongues	1
the	1
wonderful	1
works	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
doubt,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
this?	1
	1
2:13	1
Others	1
mocking	1
said,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
new	1
wine.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
Peter,	1
standing	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
eleven,	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
be	1
this	1
known	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
words:	1
2:15	1
For	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
drunken,	1
as	1
ye	1
suppose,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Joel;	1
2:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days,	1
saith	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions,	1
and	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams:	1
2:18	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
servants	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
handmaidens	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath;	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
vapour	1
of	1
smoke:	1
2:20	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
notable	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
come:	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:22	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
these	1
words;	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
a	1
man	1
approved	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs,	1
which	1
God	1
did	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
also	1
know:	1
2:23	1
Him,	1
being	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
determinate	1
counsel	1
and	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
taken,	1
and	1
by	1
wicked	1
hands	1
have	1
crucified	1
and	1
slain:	1
2:24	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
up,	1
having	1
loosed	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death:	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
holden	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
David	1
speaketh	1
concerning	1
him,	1
I	1
foresaw	1
the	1
Lord	1
always	1
before	1
my	1
face,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
did	1
my	1
heart	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
was	1
glad;	1
moreover	1
also	1
my	1
flesh	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
hope:	1
2:27	1
Because	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:28	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
life;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
with	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
2:29	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
let	1
me	1
freely	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
patriarch	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
both	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
and	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:30	1
Therefore	1
being	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
he	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
Christ	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne;	1
2:31	1
He	1
seeing	1
this	1
before	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
his	1
flesh	1
did	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
God	1
raised	1
up,	1
whereof	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
2:33	1
Therefore	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
exalted,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
forth	1
this,	1
which	1
ye	1
now	1
see	1
and	1
hear.	1
	1
2:34	1
For	1
David	1
is	1
not	1
ascended	1
into	1
the	1
heavens:	1
but	1
he	1
saith	1
himself,	1
The	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
2:35	1
Until	1
I	1
make	1
thy	1
foes	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
2:36	1
Therefore	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
know	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
crucified,	1
both	1
Lord	1
and	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:37	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
pricked	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
2:38	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Repent,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:39	1
For	1
the	1
promise	1
is	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
testify	1
and	1
exhort,	1
saying,	1
Save	1
yourselves	1
from	1
this	1
untoward	1
generation.	1
	1
2:41	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
gladly	1
received	1
his	1
word	1
were	1
baptized:	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
were	1
added	1
unto	1
them	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
souls.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
they	1
continued	1
stedfastly	1
in	1
the	1
apostles'	1
doctrine	1
and	1
fellowship,	1
and	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
prayers.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
every	1
soul:	1
and	1
many	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
together,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common;	1
2:45	1
And	1
sold	1
their	1
possessions	1
and	1
goods,	1
and	1
parted	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
they,	1
continuing	1
daily	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
breaking	1
bread	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
meat	1
with	1
gladness	1
and	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
2:47	1
Praising	1
God,	1
and	1
having	1
favour	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
daily	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
went	1
up	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
prayer,	1
being	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
lame	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb	1
was	1
carried,	1
whom	1
they	1
laid	1
daily	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Beautiful,	1
to	1
ask	1
alms	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
seeing	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
asked	1
an	1
alms.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Peter,	1
fastening	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
John,	1
said,	1
Look	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
them,	1
expecting	1
to	1
receive	1
something	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Silver	1
and	1
gold	1
have	1
I	1
none;	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
give	1
I	1
thee:	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up:	1
and	1
immediately	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
ankle	1
bones	1
received	1
strength.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
leaping	1
up	1
stood,	1
and	1
walked,	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
walking,	1
and	1
leaping,	1
and	1
praising	1
God.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
and	1
praising	1
God:	1
3:10	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
which	1
sat	1
for	1
alms	1
at	1
the	1
Beautiful	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
held	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Solomon's,	1
greatly	1
wondering.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
marvel	1
ye	1
at	1
this?	1
or	1
why	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
earnestly	1
on	1
us,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
power	1
or	1
holiness	1
we	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
walk?	1
3:13	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
hath	1
glorified	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus;	1
whom	1
ye	1
delivered	1
up,	1
and	1
denied	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
ye	1
denied	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
and	1
the	1
Just,	1
and	1
desired	1
a	1
murderer	1
to	1
be	1
granted	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:15	1
And	1
killed	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
life,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
whereof	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
hath	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
strong,	1
whom	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know:	1
yea,	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
him	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
this	1
perfect	1
soundness	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
through	1
ignorance	1
ye	1
did	1
it,	1
as	1
did	1
also	1
your	1
rulers.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
those	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
before	1
had	1
shewed	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets,	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
he	1
hath	1
so	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:19	1
Repent	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
that	1
your	1
sins	1
may	1
be	1
blotted	1
out,	1
when	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
refreshing	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
before	1
was	1
preached	1
unto	1
you:	1
3:21	1
Whom	1
the	1
heaven	1
must	1
receive	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
restitution	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began.	1
	1
3:22	1
For	1
Moses	1
truly	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
soul,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
prophet,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:24	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
from	1
Samuel	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
follow	1
after,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
spoken,	1
have	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
	1
3:25	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
God	1
made	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
saying	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:26	1
Unto	1
you	1
first	1
God,	1
having	1
raised	1
up	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
you,	1
in	1
turning	1
away	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
iniquities.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
grieved	1
that	1
they	1
taught	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
preached	1
through	1
Jesus	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
hold	1
unto	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
eventide.	1
	1
4:4	1
Howbeit	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
believed;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
4:6	1
And	1
Annas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
Caiaphas,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
they	1
asked,	1
By	1
what	1
power,	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
name,	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this?	1
	1
4:8	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
4:9	1
If	1
we	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
examined	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
deed	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
impotent	1
man,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
whole;	1
4:10	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
ye	1
crucified,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
by	1
him	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
stand	1
here	1
before	1
you	1
whole.	1
	1
4:11	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
of	1
you	1
builders,	1
which	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
4:12	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
salvation	1
in	1
any	1
other:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
name	1
under	1
heaven	1
given	1
among	1
men,	1
whereby	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
4:13	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
unlearned	1
and	1
ignorant	1
men,	1
they	1
marvelled;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
beholding	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
standing	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
they	1
conferred	1
among	1
themselves,	1
4:16	1
Saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
these	1
men?	1
for	1
that	1
indeed	1
a	1
notable	1
miracle	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
them	1
is	1
manifest	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
spread	1
no	1
further	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
let	1
us	1
straitly	1
threaten	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
henceforth	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all	1
nor	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
unto	1
God,	1
judge	1
ye.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
we	1
cannot	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
4:21	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
further	1
threatened	1
them,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
finding	1
nothing	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
punish	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
glorified	1
God	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
above	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
on	1
whom	1
this	1
miracle	1
of	1
healing	1
was	1
shewed.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
being	1
let	1
go,	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
company,	1
and	1
reported	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
God,	1
which	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is:	1
4:25	1
Who	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
hast	1
said,	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
heathen	1
rage,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
vain	1
things?	1
	1
4:26	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
against	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
anointed,	1
both	1
Herod,	1
and	1
Pontius	1
Pilate,	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
4:28	1
For	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
hand	1
and	1
thy	1
counsel	1
determined	1
before	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
now,	1
Lord,	1
behold	1
their	1
threatenings:	1
and	1
grant	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness	1
they	1
may	1
speak	1
thy	1
word,	1
4:30	1
By	1
stretching	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
heal;	1
and	1
that	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
shaken	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
together;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
boldness.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
heart	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
soul:	1
neither	1
said	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
was	1
his	1
own;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
gave	1
the	1
apostles	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
great	1
grace	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
4:34	1
Neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
lacked:	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
possessors	1
of	1
lands	1
or	1
houses	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
sold,	1
4:35	1
And	1
laid	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet:	1
and	1
distribution	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
Joses,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
apostles	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Barnabas,	1
(which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
consolation,)	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
4:37	1
Having	1
land,	1
sold	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias,	1
with	1
Sapphira	1
his	1
wife,	1
sold	1
a	1
possession,	1
5:2	1
And	1
kept	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price,	1
his	1
wife	1
also	1
being	1
privy	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
certain	1
part,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Ananias,	1
why	1
hath	1
Satan	1
filled	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
5:4	1
Whiles	1
it	1
remained,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
thine	1
own?	1
and	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
sold,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
power?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
conceived	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
thine	1
heart?	1
	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
lied	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Ananias	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
arose,	1
wound	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
after,	1
when	1
his	1
wife,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
unto	1
her,	1
Tell	1
me	1
whether	1
ye	1
sold	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
so	1
much?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Yea,	1
for	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
agreed	1
together	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
behold,	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
buried	1
thy	1
husband	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
out.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
fell	1
she	1
down	1
straightway	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
dead,	1
and,	1
carrying	1
her	1
forth,	1
buried	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
upon	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
were	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
(and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
durst	1
no	1
man	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
magnified	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
believers	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
multitudes	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women.)	1
	1
5:15	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
sick	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
beds	1
and	1
couches,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Peter	1
passing	1
by	1
might	1
overshadow	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
came	1
also	1
a	1
multitude	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
bringing	1
sick	1
folks,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed	1
every	1
one.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,)	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
indignation,	1
5:18	1
And	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
prison.	1
	1
5:19	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
night	1
opened	1
the	1
prison	1
doors,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
said,	1
5:20	1
Go,	1
stand	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
taught.	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
council	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
brought.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
officers	1
came,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
told,	1
5:23	1
Saying,	1
The	1
prison	1
truly	1
found	1
we	1
shut	1
with	1
all	1
safety,	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
standing	1
without	1
before	1
the	1
doors:	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
opened,	1
we	1
found	1
no	1
man	1
within.	1
	1
5:24	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
doubted	1
of	1
them	1
whereunto	1
this	1
would	1
grow.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
came	1
one	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
ye	1
put	1
in	1
prison	1
are	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
teaching	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
5:26	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
without	1
violence:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
stoned.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them,	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
council:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
them,	1
5:28	1
Saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
straitly	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
teach	1
in	1
this	1
name?	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
have	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
your	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
intend	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
man's	1
blood	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
apostles	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
obey	1
God	1
rather	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
5:30	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
5:31	1
Him	1
hath	1
God	1
exalted	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Prince	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
for	1
to	1
give	1
repentance	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
5:33	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
5:34	1
Then	1
stood	1
there	1
up	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
named	1
Gamaliel,	1
a	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
had	1
in	1
reputation	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
apostles	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
space;	1
5:35	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves	1
what	1
ye	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
touching	1
these	1
men.	1
	1
5:36	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
rose	1
up	1
Theudas,	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
somebody;	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
about	1
four	1
hundred,	1
joined	1
themselves:	1
who	1
was	1
slain;	1
and	1
all,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
scattered,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:37	1
After	1
this	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
Judas	1
of	1
Galilee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
taxing,	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
much	1
people	1
after	1
him:	1
he	1
also	1
perished;	1
and	1
all,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
dispersed.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Refrain	1
from	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
alone:	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
counsel	1
or	1
this	1
work	1
be	1
of	1
men,	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
5:39	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
overthrow	1
it;	1
lest	1
haply	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
agreed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
beaten	1
them,	1
they	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
worthy	1
to	1
suffer	1
shame	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
house,	1
they	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
preach	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
was	1
multiplied,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
Grecians	1
against	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
because	1
their	1
widows	1
were	1
neglected	1
in	1
the	1
daily	1
ministration.	1
	1
6:2	1
Then	1
the	1
twelve	1
called	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
tables.	1
	1
6:3	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
look	1
ye	1
out	1
among	1
you	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
honest	1
report,	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
this	1
business.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
ourselves	1
continually	1
to	1
prayer,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
chose	1
Stephen,	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Prochorus,	1
and	1
Nicanor,	1
and	1
Timon,	1
and	1
Parmenas,	1
and	1
Nicolas	1
a	1
proselyte	1
of	1
Antioch:	1
6:6	1
Whom	1
they	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
apostles:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
increased;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
greatly;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
Stephen,	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
power,	1
did	1
great	1
wonders	1
and	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Libertines,	1
and	1
Cyrenians,	1
and	1
Alexandrians,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
disputing	1
with	1
Stephen.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
they	1
suborned	1
men,	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
council,	1
6:13	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
this	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
law:	1
6:14	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
shall	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
change	1
the	1
customs	1
which	1
Moses	1
delivered	1
us.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
looking	1
stedfastly	1
on	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
angel.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
Are	1
these	1
things	1
so?	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hearken;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
glory	1
appeared	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
before	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran,	1
7:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldaeans,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran:	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
removed	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
now	1
dwell.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
none	1
inheritance	1
in	1
it,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on:	1
yet	1
he	1
promised	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him,	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
That	1
his	1
seed	1
should	1
sojourn	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage,	1
and	1
entreat	1
them	1
evil	1
four	1
hundred	1
years.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bondage	1
will	1
I	1
judge,	1
said	1
God:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
circumcision:	1
and	1
so	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
the	1
eighth	1
day;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
begat	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
begat	1
the	1
twelve	1
patriarchs.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
patriarchs,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
but	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
7:10	1
And	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
afflictions,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
and	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
governor	1
over	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:11	1
Now	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
dearth	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Chanaan,	1
and	1
great	1
affliction:	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
found	1
no	1
sustenance.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
our	1
fathers	1
first.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
Joseph	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
kindred	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
sent	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
father	1
Jacob	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kindred,	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
souls.	1
	1
7:15	1
So	1
Jacob	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
died,	1
he,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
7:16	1
And	1
were	1
carried	1
over	1
into	1
Sychem,	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
for	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Emmor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Sychem.	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
people	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
7:18	1
Till	1
another	1
king	1
arose,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
7:19	1
The	1
same	1
dealt	1
subtilly	1
with	1
our	1
kindred,	1
and	1
evil	1
entreated	1
our	1
fathers,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
their	1
young	1
children,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
which	1
time	1
Moses	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
was	1
exceeding	1
fair,	1
and	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
three	1
months:	1
7:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
nourished	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
son.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
learned	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
deeds.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
seeing	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suffer	1
wrong,	1
he	1
defended	1
him,	1
and	1
avenged	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptian:	1
7:25	1
For	1
he	1
supposed	1
his	1
brethren	1
would	1
have	1
understood	1
how	1
that	1
God	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
would	1
deliver	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
strove,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
one	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren;	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
wrong	1
one	1
to	1
another?	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
his	1
neighbour	1
wrong	1
thrust	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
7:28	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
diddest	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
yesterday?	1
	1
7:29	1
Then	1
fled	1
Moses	1
at	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Madian,	1
where	1
he	1
begat	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
forty	1
years	1
were	1
expired,	1
there	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mount	1
Sina	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
bush.	1
	1
7:31	1
When	1
Moses	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
sight:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
behold	1
it,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
7:32	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Then	1
Moses	1
trembled,	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
behold.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
him,	1
Put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
7:34	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
Moses	1
whom	1
they	1
refused,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge?	1
the	1
same	1
did	1
God	1
send	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
deliverer	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bush.	1
	1
7:36	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
Moses,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear.	1
	1
7:38	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Sina,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
fathers:	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
lively	1
oracles	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
us:	1
7:39	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
not	1
obey,	1
but	1
thrust	1
him	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
7:40	1
Saying	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
which	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:41	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
calf	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
idol,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
7:42	1
Then	1
God	1
turned,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
ye	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
slain	1
beasts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
7:43	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Moloch,	1
and	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god	1
Remphan,	1
figures	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
worship	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
you	1
away	1
beyond	1
Babylon.	1
	1
7:44	1
Our	1
fathers	1
had	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appointed,	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fashion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
7:45	1
Which	1
also	1
our	1
fathers	1
that	1
came	1
after	1
brought	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whom	1
God	1
drave	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David;	1
7:46	1
Who	1
found	1
favour	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
7:47	1
But	1
Solomon	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:48	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
as	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet,	1
7:49	1
Heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
what	1
house	1
will	1
ye	1
build	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord:	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
7:50	1
Hath	1
not	1
my	1
hand	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
7:51	1
Ye	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
ears,	1
ye	1
do	1
always	1
resist	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did,	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:52	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
not	1
your	1
fathers	1
persecuted?	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
which	1
shewed	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Just	1
One;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
the	1
betrayers	1
and	1
murderers:	1
7:53	1
Who	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
it.	1
	1
7:54	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
they	1
gnashed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
7:55	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
looked	1
up	1
stedfastly	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
7:56	1
And	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:57	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
ran	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
7:58	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
witnesses	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
clothes	1
at	1
a	1
young	1
man's	1
feet,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul.	1
	1
7:59	1
And	1
they	1
stoned	1
Stephen,	1
calling	1
upon	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
receive	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
7:60	1
And	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lord,	1
lay	1
not	1
this	1
sin	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
persecution	1
against	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
except	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
devout	1
men	1
carried	1
Stephen	1
to	1
his	1
burial,	1
and	1
made	1
great	1
lamentation	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
8:3	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
made	1
havock	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
entering	1
into	1
every	1
house,	1
and	1
haling	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
committed	1
them	1
to	1
prison.	1
	1
8:4	1
Therefore	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
went	1
every	1
where	1
preaching	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
8:5	1
Then	1
Philip	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
preached	1
Christ	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Philip	1
spake,	1
hearing	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
crying	1
with	1
loud	1
voice,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
many	1
taken	1
with	1
palsies,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
called	1
Simon,	1
which	1
beforetime	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
city	1
used	1
sorcery,	1
and	1
bewitched	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
giving	1
out	1
that	1
himself	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
one:	1
8:10	1
To	1
whom	1
they	1
all	1
gave	1
heed,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
regard,	1
because	1
that	1
of	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
bewitched	1
them	1
with	1
sorceries.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
believed	1
Philip	1
preaching	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
Simon	1
himself	1
believed	1
also:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
Philip,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
beholding	1
the	1
miracles	1
and	1
signs	1
which	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
apostles	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
heard	1
that	1
Samaria	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
Peter	1
and	1
John:	1
8:15	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down,	1
prayed	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
8:16	1
(For	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
none	1
of	1
them:	1
only	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.)	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
laid	1
they	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
when	1
Simon	1
saw	1
that	1
through	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
apostles'	1
hands	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
given,	1
he	1
offered	1
them	1
money,	1
8:19	1
Saying,	1
Give	1
me	1
also	1
this	1
power,	1
that	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
lay	1
hands,	1
he	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:20	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
money	1
perish	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
purchased	1
with	1
money.	1
	1
8:21	1
Thou	1
hast	1
neither	1
part	1
nor	1
lot	1
in	1
this	1
matter:	1
for	1
thy	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
Repent	1
therefore	1
of	1
this	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
pray	1
God,	1
if	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
8:23	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
8:24	1
Then	1
answered	1
Simon,	1
and	1
said,	1
Pray	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
come	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
testified	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
many	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
is	1
desert.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
an	1
eunuch	1
of	1
great	1
authority	1
under	1
Candace	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
treasure,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship,	1
8:28	1
Was	1
returning,	1
and	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
read	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
8:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
join	1
thyself	1
to	1
this	1
chariot.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Philip	1
ran	1
thither	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
read	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
and	1
said,	1
Understandest	1
thou	1
what	1
thou	1
readest?	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I,	1
except	1
some	1
man	1
should	1
guide	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
Philip	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:32	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
which	1
he	1
read	1
was	1
this,	1
He	1
was	1
led	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
dumb	1
before	1
his	1
shearer,	1
so	1
opened	1
he	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
8:33	1
In	1
his	1
humiliation	1
his	1
judgment	1
was	1
taken	1
away:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
eunuch	1
answered	1
Philip,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
whom	1
speaketh	1
the	1
prophet	1
this?	1
of	1
himself,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
man?	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
Philip	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
scripture,	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
him	1
Jesus.	1
	1
8:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch	1
said,	1
See,	1
here	1
is	1
water;	1
what	1
doth	1
hinder	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
baptized?	1
	1
8:37	1
And	1
Philip	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
believest	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
thou	1
mayest.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:38	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
stand	1
still:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
both	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
both	1
Philip	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch;	1
and	1
he	1
baptized	1
him.	1
	1
8:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
caught	1
away	1
Philip,	1
that	1
the	1
eunuch	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
Philip	1
was	1
found	1
at	1
Azotus:	1
and	1
passing	1
through	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Saul,	1
yet	1
breathing	1
out	1
threatenings	1
and	1
slaughter	1
against	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
9:2	1
And	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
Damascus	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
way,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
or	1
women,	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shined	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven:	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest:	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
trembling	1
and	1
astonished	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
him	1
stood	1
speechless,	1
hearing	1
a	1
voice,	1
but	1
seeing	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
without	1
sight,	1
and	1
neither	1
did	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
named	1
Ananias;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
Ananias.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Straight,	1
and	1
enquire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judas	1
for	1
one	1
called	1
Saul,	1
of	1
Tarsus:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prayeth,	1
9:12	1
And	1
hath	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
Ananias	1
answered,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
how	1
much	1
evil	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
thy	1
saints	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
9:14	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
hath	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
to	1
bind	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
vessel	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
name	1
before	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
Ananias	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
said,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
thou	1
camest,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
scales:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
sight	1
forthwith,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
meat,	1
he	1
was	1
strengthened.	1
Then	1
was	1
Saul	1
certain	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
disciples	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
preached	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said;	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
them	1
which	1
called	1
on	1
this	1
name	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
came	1
hither	1
for	1
that	1
intent,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests?	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Saul	1
increased	1
the	1
more	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
confounded	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
proving	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
many	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
kill	1
him:	1
9:24	1
But	1
their	1
laying	1
await	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
Saul.	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
the	1
gates	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
a	1
basket.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
disciples:	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
believed	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disciple.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
preached	1
boldly	1
at	1
Damascus	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
disputed	1
against	1
the	1
Grecians:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
9:30	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
knew,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
Tarsus.	1
	1
9:31	1
Then	1
had	1
the	1
churches	1
rest	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Galilee	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
were	1
edified;	1
and	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
were	1
multiplied.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Peter	1
passed	1
throughout	1
all	1
quarters,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Aeneas,	1
which	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
bed	1
eight	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Aeneas,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
maketh	1
thee	1
whole:	1
arise,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
bed.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
immediately.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda	1
and	1
Saron	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:36	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
Joppa	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
named	1
Tabitha,	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
called	1
Dorcas:	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
works	1
and	1
almsdeeds	1
which	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
died:	1
whom	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
washed,	1
they	1
laid	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
upper	1
chamber.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
Lydda	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Peter	1
was	1
there,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
Then	1
Peter	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
widows	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
coats	1
and	1
garments	1
which	1
Dorcas	1
made,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:40	1
But	1
Peter	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
forth,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed;	1
and	1
turning	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
said,	1
Tabitha,	1
arise.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter,	1
she	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
widows,	1
presented	1
her	1
alive.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
throughout	1
all	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
Joppa	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner.	1
	1
10:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
in	1
Caesarea	1
called	1
Cornelius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
called	1
the	1
Italian	1
band,	1
10:2	1
A	1
devout	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feared	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
gave	1
much	1
alms	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
alway.	1
	1
10:3	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
evidently	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
coming	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cornelius.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
Lord?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
prayers	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
come	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
now	1
send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
one	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter:	1
10:6	1
He	1
lodgeth	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner,	1
whose	1
house	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
Cornelius	1
was	1
departed,	1
he	1
called	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
household	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
devout	1
soldier	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
continually;	1
10:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Joppa.	1
	1
10:9	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
Peter	1
went	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
hungry,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
eaten:	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
made	1
ready,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
10:11	1
And	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descending	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
four	1
corners,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
10:12	1
Wherein	1
were	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
Peter;	1
kill,	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
eaten	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
10:16	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
thrice:	1
and	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
while	1
Peter	1
doubted	1
in	1
himself	1
what	1
this	1
vision	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
should	1
mean,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Cornelius	1
had	1
made	1
enquiry	1
for	1
Simon's	1
house,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate,	1
10:18	1
And	1
called,	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
Simon,	1
which	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Peter,	1
were	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
While	1
Peter	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
vision,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
three	1
men	1
seek	1
thee.	1
	1
10:20	1
Arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
doubting	1
nothing:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
them.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Peter	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
Cornelius;	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
come?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Cornelius	1
the	1
centurion,	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
report	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
warned	1
from	1
God	1
by	1
an	1
holy	1
angel	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
thee	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
words	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
10:23	1
Then	1
called	1
he	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
lodged	1
them.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Peter	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
from	1
Joppa	1
accompanied	1
him.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
Caesarea.	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
waited	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
his	1
kinsmen	1
and	1
near	1
friends.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
coming	1
in,	1
Cornelius	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
Peter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Stand	1
up;	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unlawful	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
nation;	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
any	1
man	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:29	1
Therefore	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
without	1
gainsaying,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
for:	1
I	1
ask	1
therefore	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
said,	1
Four	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
fasting	1
until	1
this	1
hour;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
bright	1
clothing,	1
10:31	1
And	1
said,	1
Cornelius,	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard,	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
had	1
in	1
remembrance	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Send	1
therefore	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
hither	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
he	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
Immediately	1
therefore	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
done	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
here	1
present	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
commanded	1
thee	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Then	1
Peter	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
no	1
respecter	1
of	1
persons:	1
10:35	1
But	1
in	1
every	1
nation	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
him,	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
is	1
accepted	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:36	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
God	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
preaching	1
peace	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
(he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
all:)	1
10:37	1
That	1
word,	1
I	1
say,	1
ye	1
know,	1
which	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
began	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
after	1
the	1
baptism	1
which	1
John	1
preached;	1
10:38	1
How	1
God	1
anointed	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
power:	1
who	1
went	1
about	1
doing	1
good,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
oppressed	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
whom	1
they	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
10:40	1
Him	1
God	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
openly;	1
10:41	1
Not	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
but	1
unto	1
witnesses	1
chosen	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
quick	1
and	1
dead.	1
	1
10:43	1
To	1
him	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
witness,	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
name	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
receive	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:44	1
While	1
Peter	1
yet	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
10:45	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
which	1
believed	1
were	1
astonished,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
with	1
Peter,	1
because	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
10:46	1
For	1
they	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
magnify	1
God.	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
10:47	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
forbid	1
water,	1
that	1
these	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
baptized,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we?	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Then	1
prayed	1
they	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Judaea	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
had	1
also	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
contended	1
with	1
him,	1
11:3	1
Saying,	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
in	1
to	1
men	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
didst	1
eat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
Peter	1
rehearsed	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
expounded	1
it	1
by	1
order	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
11:5	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Joppa	1
praying:	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
vision,	1
A	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descend,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet,	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
four	1
corners;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
me:	1
11:6	1
Upon	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fastened	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
I	1
considered,	1
and	1
saw	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
Peter;	1
slay	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord:	1
for	1
nothing	1
common	1
or	1
unclean	1
hath	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
the	1
voice	1
answered	1
me	1
again	1
from	1
heaven,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
immediately	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
men	1
already	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
sent	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
nothing	1
doubting.	1
Moreover	1
these	1
six	1
brethren	1
accompanied	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
man's	1
house:	1
11:13	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
us	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
stood	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
11:14	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
words,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
on	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
remembered	1
I	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
John	1
indeed	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
11:17	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
like	1
gift	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us,	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
what	1
was	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
withstand	1
God?	1
	1
11:18	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Then	1
hath	1
God	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
granted	1
repentance	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
11:19	1
Now	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
persecution	1
that	1
arose	1
about	1
Stephen	1
travelled	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
Cyprus,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
only.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
Cyprus	1
and	1
Cyrene,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
preaching	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
believed,	1
and	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
tidings	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
Barnabas,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
exhorted	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
with	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
they	1
would	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
of	1
faith:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
departed	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Tarsus,	1
for	1
to	1
seek	1
Saul:	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
taught	1
much	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
called	1
Christians	1
first	1
in	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
came	1
prophets	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
named	1
Agabus,	1
and	1
signified	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
great	1
dearth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
world:	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Claudius	1
Caesar.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability,	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
relief	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Judaea:	1
11:30	1
Which	1
also	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
elders	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
about	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
vex	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
James	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
John	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
further	1
to	1
take	1
Peter	1
also.	1
(Then	1
were	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
apprehended	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
four	1
quaternions	1
of	1
soldiers	1
to	1
keep	1
him;	1
intending	1
after	1
Easter	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
12:5	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
prison:	1
but	1
prayer	1
was	1
made	1
without	1
ceasing	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
Peter	1
was	1
sleeping	1
between	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains:	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
kept	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
12:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
shined	1
in	1
the	1
prison:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
Peter	1
on	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Arise	1
up	1
quickly.	1
And	1
his	1
chains	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
bind	1
on	1
thy	1
sandals.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cast	1
thy	1
garment	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
which	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
angel;	1
but	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
vision.	1
	1
12:10	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
ward,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
iron	1
gate	1
that	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
the	1
city;	1
which	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
through	1
one	1
street;	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Herod,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
considered	1
the	1
thing,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark;	1
where	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
praying.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
to	1
hearken,	1
named	1
Rhoda.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
Peter's	1
voice,	1
she	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
gladness,	1
but	1
ran	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
how	1
Peter	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
mad.	1
But	1
she	1
constantly	1
affirmed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
so.	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
It	1
is	1
his	1
angel.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
continued	1
knocking:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
he,	1
beckoning	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
shew	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
James,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
brethren.	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
another	1
place.	1
	1
12:18	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
what	1
was	1
become	1
of	1
Peter.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
had	1
sought	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
keepers,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
there	1
abode.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Herod	1
was	1
highly	1
displeased	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon:	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
made	1
Blastus	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain	1
their	1
friend,	1
desired	1
peace;	1
because	1
their	1
country	1
was	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
country.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
upon	1
a	1
set	1
day	1
Herod,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
royal	1
apparel,	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
oration	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gave	1
a	1
shout,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
gave	1
not	1
God	1
the	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eaten	1
of	1
worms,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
their	1
ministry,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Antioch	1
certain	1
prophets	1
and	1
teachers;	1
as	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Niger,	1
and	1
Lucius	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
Manaen,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
13:2	1
As	1
they	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
said,	1
Separate	1
me	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
whereunto	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
they	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
13:4	1
So	1
they,	1
being	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
departed	1
unto	1
Seleucia;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
sailed	1
to	1
Cyprus.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
Salamis,	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
John	1
to	1
their	1
minister.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
isle	1
unto	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
sorcerer,	1
a	1
false	1
prophet,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Barjesus:	1
13:7	1
Which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
Sergius	1
Paulus,	1
a	1
prudent	1
man;	1
who	1
called	1
for	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:8	1
But	1
Elymas	1
the	1
sorcerer	1
(for	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
by	1
interpretation)	1
withstood	1
them,	1
seeking	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
deputy	1
from	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
13:9	1
Then	1
Saul,	1
(who	1
also	1
is	1
called	1
Paul,)	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
set	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
subtilty	1
and	1
all	1
mischief,	1
thou	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
thou	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blind,	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
mist	1
and	1
a	1
darkness;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
seeking	1
some	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
13:12	1
Then	1
the	1
deputy,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
believed,	1
being	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:13	1
Now	1
when	1
Paul	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
loosed	1
from	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Perga	1
in	1
Pamphylia:	1
and	1
John	1
departing	1
from	1
them	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Perga,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch	1
in	1
Pisidia,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
sent	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
13:16	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
beckoning	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
said,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
give	1
audience.	1
	1
13:17	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
chose	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
exalted	1
the	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
dwelt	1
as	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
arm	1
brought	1
he	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
suffered	1
he	1
their	1
manners	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
seven	1
nations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chanaan,	1
he	1
divided	1
their	1
land	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
lot.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
judges	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years,	1
until	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
afterward	1
they	1
desired	1
a	1
king:	1
and	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cis,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king;	1
to	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
testimony,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
fulfil	1
all	1
my	1
will.	1
	1
13:23	1
Of	1
this	1
man's	1
seed	1
hath	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise	1
raised	1
unto	1
Israel	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
Jesus:	1
13:24	1
When	1
John	1
had	1
first	1
preached	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
as	1
John	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
course,	1
he	1
said,	1
Whom	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
he.	1
But,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
after	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
loose.	1
	1
13:26	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
among	1
you	1
feareth	1
God,	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
this	1
salvation	1
sent.	1
	1
13:27	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
their	1
rulers,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
are	1
read	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
they	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
them	1
in	1
condemning	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him,	1
yet	1
desired	1
they	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
13:30	1
But	1
God	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
13:31	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
many	1
days	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
we	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
glad	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
13:33	1
God	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
same	1
unto	1
us	1
their	1
children,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
again;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
13:34	1
And	1
as	1
concerning	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
now	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
corruption,	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
13:35	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:36	1
For	1
David,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
his	1
own	1
generation	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
fell	1
on	1
sleep,	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
unto	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
saw	1
corruption:	1
13:37	1
But	1
he,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
again,	1
saw	1
no	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:38	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore,	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
that	1
through	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
13:39	1
And	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
are	1
justified	1
from	1
all	1
things,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
13:40	1
Beware	1
therefore,	1
lest	1
that	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
prophets;	1
13:41	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
despisers,	1
and	1
wonder,	1
and	1
perish:	1
for	1
I	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
believe,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
13:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
besought	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
preached	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:43	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
religious	1
proselytes	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas:	1
who,	1
speaking	1
to	1
them,	1
persuaded	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:44	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath	1
day	1
came	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:45	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
envy,	1
and	1
spake	1
against	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul,	1
contradicting	1
and	1
blaspheming.	1
	1
13:46	1
Then	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
waxed	1
bold,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
first	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
to	1
you:	1
but	1
seeing	1
ye	1
put	1
it	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
judge	1
yourselves	1
unworthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
lo,	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
13:47	1
For	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
us,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
for	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
13:48	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
glorified	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
ordained	1
to	1
eternal	1
life	1
believed.	1
	1
13:49	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region.	1
	1
13:50	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
devout	1
and	1
honourable	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
raised	1
persecution	1
against	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
expelled	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
13:51	1
But	1
they	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Iconium.	1
	1
13:52	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Iconium,	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
so	1
spake,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks	1
believed.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
minds	1
evil	1
affected	1
against	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
14:3	1
Long	1
time	1
therefore	1
abode	1
they	1
speaking	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
which	1
gave	1
testimony	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
and	1
granted	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
divided:	1
and	1
part	1
held	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
assault	1
made	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
with	1
their	1
rulers,	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
despitefully,	1
and	1
to	1
stone	1
them,	1
14:6	1
They	1
were	1
ware	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
fled	1
unto	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Derbe,	1
cities	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
region	1
that	1
lieth	1
round	1
about:	1
14:7	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
at	1
Lystra,	1
impotent	1
in	1
his	1
feet,	1
being	1
a	1
cripple	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
walked:	1
14:9	1
The	1
same	1
heard	1
Paul	1
speak:	1
who	1
stedfastly	1
beholding	1
him,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
faith	1
to	1
be	1
healed,	1
14:10	1
Said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Stand	1
upright	1
on	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
he	1
leaped	1
and	1
walked.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
what	1
Paul	1
had	1
done,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
The	1
gods	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Barnabas,	1
Jupiter;	1
and	1
Paul,	1
Mercurius,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
speaker.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
their	1
city,	1
brought	1
oxen	1
and	1
garlands	1
unto	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:14	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
heard	1
of,	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
crying	1
out,	1
14:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
these	1
things?	1
We	1
also	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
like	1
passions	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
turn	1
from	1
these	1
vanities	1
unto	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
which	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
therein:	1
14:16	1
Who	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
suffered	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
ways.	1
	1
14:17	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
left	1
not	1
himself	1
without	1
witness,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fruitful	1
seasons,	1
filling	1
our	1
hearts	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
sayings	1
scarce	1
restrained	1
they	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
thither	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Iconium,	1
who	1
persuaded	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
having	1
stoned	1
Paul,	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
supposing	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dead.	1
	1
14:20	1
Howbeit,	1
as	1
the	1
disciples	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
departed	1
with	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Derbe.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
had	1
taught	1
many,	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
Lystra,	1
and	1
to	1
Iconium,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
14:22	1
Confirming	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
exhorting	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
through	1
much	1
tribulation	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
ordained	1
them	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
church,	1
and	1
had	1
prayed	1
with	1
fasting,	1
they	1
commended	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
believed.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
throughout	1
Pisidia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Pamphylia.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Perga,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Attalia:	1
14:26	1
And	1
thence	1
sailed	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
church	1
together,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
abode	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
certain	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
taught	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
15:2	1
When	1
therefore	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
had	1
no	1
small	1
dissension	1
and	1
disputation	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
determined	1
that	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
about	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
being	1
brought	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
church,	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
Phenice	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
declaring	1
the	1
conversion	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
great	1
joy	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
were	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
they	1
declared	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
believed,	1
saying,	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
to	1
circumcise	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
came	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
disputing,	1
Peter	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
ago	1
God	1
made	1
choice	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
my	1
mouth	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
believe.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
God,	1
which	1
knoweth	1
the	1
hearts,	1
bare	1
them	1
witness,	1
giving	1
them	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us;	1
15:9	1
And	1
put	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
them,	1
purifying	1
their	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
15:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
God,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
which	1
neither	1
our	1
fathers	1
nor	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
bear?	1
15:11	1
But	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
even	1
as	1
they.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
kept	1
silence,	1
and	1
gave	1
audience	1
to	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
declaring	1
what	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
James	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:14	1
Simeon	1
hath	1
declared	1
how	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
did	1
visit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
to	1
this	1
agree	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
15:16	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
fallen	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
ruins	1
thereof,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
it	1
up:	1
15:17	1
That	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
men	1
might	1
seek	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
upon	1
whom	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
called,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
doeth	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:18	1
Known	1
unto	1
God	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
sentence	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
trouble	1
not	1
them,	1
which	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
turned	1
to	1
God:	1
15:20	1
But	1
that	1
we	1
write	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
abstain	1
from	1
pollutions	1
of	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
blood.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
Moses	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
hath	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
him,	1
being	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:22	1
Then	1
pleased	1
it	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
company	1
to	1
Antioch	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas;	1
namely,	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Barsabas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
chief	1
men	1
among	1
the	1
brethren:	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
wrote	1
letters	1
by	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
The	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
and	1
brethren	1
send	1
greeting	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia.	1
	1
15:24	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
that	1
certain	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us	1
have	1
troubled	1
you	1
with	1
words,	1
subverting	1
your	1
souls,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
no	1
such	1
commandment:	1
15:25	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
being	1
assembled	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
our	1
beloved	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
15:26	1
Men	1
that	1
have	1
hazarded	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:27	1
We	1
have	1
sent	1
therefore	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
who	1
shall	1
also	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
by	1
mouth.	1
	1
15:28	1
For	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
lay	1
upon	1
you	1
no	1
greater	1
burden	1
than	1
these	1
necessary	1
things;	1
15:29	1
That	1
ye	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication:	1
from	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
yourselves,	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
Fare	1
ye	1
well.	1
	1
15:30	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
multitude	1
together,	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle:	1
15:31	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
being	1
prophets	1
also	1
themselves,	1
exhorted	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
many	1
words,	1
and	1
confirmed	1
them.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
tarried	1
there	1
a	1
space,	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
go	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:34	1
Notwithstanding	1
it	1
pleased	1
Silas	1
to	1
abide	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
15:35	1
Paul	1
also	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
continued	1
in	1
Antioch,	1
teaching	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
some	1
days	1
after	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
Barnabas,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
again	1
and	1
visit	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
15:38	1
But	1
Paul	1
thought	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
who	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
from	1
Pamphylia,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
the	1
contention	1
was	1
so	1
sharp	1
between	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
asunder	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other:	1
and	1
so	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
Mark,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Cyprus;	1
15:40	1
And	1
Paul	1
chose	1
Silas,	1
and	1
departed,	1
being	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia,	1
confirming	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
to	1
Derbe	1
and	1
Lystra:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
was	1
there,	1
named	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
and	1
believed;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek:	1
16:2	1
Which	1
was	1
well	1
reported	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Iconium.	1
	1
16:3	1
Him	1
would	1
Paul	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
took	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
those	1
quarters:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities,	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
the	1
decrees	1
for	1
to	1
keep,	1
that	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
churches	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
number	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
throughout	1
Phrygia	1
and	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
and	1
were	1
forbidden	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Asia,	1
16:7	1
After	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Mysia,	1
they	1
assayed	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Bithynia:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
suffered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
passing	1
by	1
Mysia	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Troas.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
There	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
over	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
immediately	1
we	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
assuredly	1
gathering	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
called	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
16:11	1
Therefore	1
loosing	1
from	1
Troas,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
Samothracia,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Neapolis;	1
16:12	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Philippi,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
city	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
a	1
colony:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
abiding	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
river	1
side,	1
where	1
prayer	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
women	1
which	1
resorted	1
thither.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Lydia,	1
a	1
seller	1
of	1
purple,	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Thyatira,	1
which	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
heard	1
us:	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
Lord	1
opened,	1
that	1
she	1
attended	1
unto	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
baptized,	1
and	1
her	1
household,	1
she	1
besought	1
us,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
judged	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
abide	1
there.	1
And	1
she	1
constrained	1
us.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
prayer,	1
a	1
certain	1
damsel	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
divination	1
met	1
us,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
masters	1
much	1
gain	1
by	1
soothsaying:	1
16:17	1
The	1
same	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
us,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
shew	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
this	1
did	1
she	1
many	1
days.	1
But	1
Paul,	1
being	1
grieved,	1
turned	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
spirit,	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
hour.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
masters	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
their	1
gains	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
caught	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
marketplace	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers,	1
16:20	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
magistrates,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men,	1
being	1
Jews,	1
do	1
exceedingly	1
trouble	1
our	1
city,	1
16:21	1
And	1
teach	1
customs,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
receive,	1
neither	1
to	1
observe,	1
being	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rose	1
up	1
together	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
magistrates	1
rent	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
beat	1
them.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
many	1
stripes	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison,	1
charging	1
the	1
jailor	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
safely:	1
16:24	1
Who,	1
having	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
charge,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
prison,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
feet	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
prayed,	1
and	1
sang	1
praises	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
shaken:	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
every	1
one's	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
awaking	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
prison	1
doors	1
open,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
himself,	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
fled.	1
	1
16:28	1
But	1
Paul	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
thyself	1
no	1
harm:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here.	1
	1
16:29	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
16:30	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
what	1
must	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Believe	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
washed	1
their	1
stripes;	1
and	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his,	1
straightway.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
rejoiced,	1
believing	1
in	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
magistrates	1
sent	1
the	1
serjeants,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
those	1
men	1
go.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
told	1
this	1
saying	1
to	1
Paul,	1
The	1
magistrates	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go:	1
now	1
therefore	1
depart,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
16:37	1
But	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
beaten	1
us	1
openly	1
uncondemned,	1
being	1
Romans,	1
and	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
into	1
prison;	1
and	1
now	1
do	1
they	1
thrust	1
us	1
out	1
privily?	1
nay	1
verily;	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
themselves	1
and	1
fetch	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
16:38	1
And	1
the	1
serjeants	1
told	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
magistrates:	1
and	1
they	1
feared,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
desired	1
them	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
16:40	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Lydia:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
brethren,	1
they	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Amphipolis	1
and	1
Apollonia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Thessalonica,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
17:2	1
And	1
Paul,	1
as	1
his	1
manner	1
was,	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
three	1
sabbath	1
days	1
reasoned	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
17:3	1
Opening	1
and	1
alleging,	1
that	1
Christ	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
suffered,	1
and	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
I	1
preach	1
unto	1
you,	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
believed,	1
and	1
consorted	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
devout	1
Greeks	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
women	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:5	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
not,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
took	1
unto	1
them	1
certain	1
lewd	1
fellows	1
of	1
the	1
baser	1
sort,	1
and	1
gathered	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
assaulted	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not,	1
they	1
drew	1
Jason	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
crying,	1
These	1
that	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
world	1
upside	1
down	1
are	1
come	1
hither	1
also;	1
17:7	1
Whom	1
Jason	1
hath	1
received:	1
and	1
these	1
all	1
do	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
king,	1
one	1
Jesus.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
they	1
troubled	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
security	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
brethren	1
immediately	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
by	1
night	1
unto	1
Berea:	1
who	1
coming	1
thither	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
17:11	1
These	1
were	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
those	1
in	1
Thessalonica,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
all	1
readiness	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
daily,	1
whether	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
believed;	1
also	1
of	1
honourable	1
women	1
which	1
were	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
of	1
men,	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:13	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
Thessalonica	1
had	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
Paul	1
at	1
Berea,	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
also,	1
and	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
then	1
immediately	1
the	1
brethren	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
but	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
abode	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
conducted	1
Paul	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Athens:	1
and	1
receiving	1
a	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
for	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
speed,	1
they	1
departed.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
while	1
Paul	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Athens,	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
stirred	1
in	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
city	1
wholly	1
given	1
to	1
idolatry.	1
	1
17:17	1
Therefore	1
disputed	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
devout	1
persons,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
daily	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
met	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:18	1
Then	1
certain	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1
Epicureans,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Stoicks,	1
encountered	1
him.	1
And	1
some	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
this	1
babbler	1
say?	1
other	1
some,	1
He	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
setter	1
forth	1
of	1
strange	1
gods:	1
because	1
he	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Areopagus,	1
saying,	1
May	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine,	1
whereof	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
is?	1
	1
17:20	1
For	1
thou	1
bringest	1
certain	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
our	1
ears:	1
we	1
would	1
know	1
therefore	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean.	1
	1
17:21	1
(For	1
all	1
the	1
Athenians	1
and	1
strangers	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
nothing	1
else,	1
but	1
either	1
to	1
tell,	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
new	1
thing.)	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Mars'	1
hill,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Athens,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
are	1
too	1
superstitious.	1
	1
17:23	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
beheld	1
your	1
devotions,	1
I	1
found	1
an	1
altar	1
with	1
this	1
inscription,	1
TO	1
THE	1
UNKNOWN	1
GOD.	1
Whom	1
therefore	1
ye	1
ignorantly	1
worship,	1
him	1
declare	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:24	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
therein,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
17:25	1
Neither	1
is	1
worshipped	1
with	1
men's	1
hands,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
needed	1
any	1
thing,	1
seeing	1
he	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
breath,	1
and	1
all	1
things;	1
17:26	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
blood	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
determined	1
the	1
times	1
before	1
appointed,	1
and	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
their	1
habitation;	1
17:27	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
Lord,	1
if	1
haply	1
they	1
might	1
feel	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us:	1
17:28	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
live,	1
and	1
move,	1
and	1
have	1
our	1
being;	1
as	1
certain	1
also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
poets	1
have	1
said,	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
also	1
his	1
offspring.	1
	1
17:29	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Godhead	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
gold,	1
or	1
silver,	1
or	1
stone,	1
graven	1
by	1
art	1
and	1
man's	1
device.	1
	1
17:30	1
And	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
this	1
ignorance	1
God	1
winked	1
at;	1
but	1
now	1
commandeth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
to	1
repent:	1
17:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
a	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
righteousness	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
ordained;	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
assurance	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
some	1
mocked:	1
and	1
others	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
hear	1
thee	1
again	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
17:33	1
So	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
17:34	1
Howbeit	1
certain	1
men	1
clave	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
believed:	1
among	1
the	1
which	1
was	1
Dionysius	1
the	1
Areopagite,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
named	1
Damaris,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
Athens,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Corinth;	1
18:2	1
And	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Aquila,	1
born	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
lately	1
come	1
from	1
Italy,	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Priscilla;	1
(because	1
that	1
Claudius	1
had	1
commanded	1
all	1
Jews	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
Rome:)	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
craft,	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
wrought:	1
for	1
by	1
their	1
occupation	1
they	1
were	1
tentmakers.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
reasoned	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
every	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
when	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul	1
was	1
pressed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
blasphemed,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Your	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
heads;	1
I	1
am	1
clean;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
man's	1
house,	1
named	1
Justus,	1
one	1
that	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
whose	1
house	1
joined	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Crispus,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
hearing	1
believed,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
18:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
vision,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
but	1
speak,	1
and	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace:	1
18:10	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
set	1
on	1
thee	1
to	1
hurt	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
he	1
continued	1
there	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
when	1
Gallio	1
was	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
Jews	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
18:13	1
Saying,	1
This	1
fellow	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Gallio	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
wrong	1
or	1
wicked	1
lewdness,	1
O	1
ye	1
Jews,	1
reason	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
with	1
you:	1
18:15	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
names,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
law,	1
look	1
ye	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
he	1
drave	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Greeks	1
took	1
Sosthenes,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
beat	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
And	1
Gallio	1
cared	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
Paul	1
after	1
this	1
tarried	1
there	1
yet	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sailed	1
thence	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila;	1
having	1
shorn	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Cenchrea:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vow.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
there:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
reasoned	1
with	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
18:20	1
When	1
they	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
longer	1
time	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
consented	1
not;	1
18:21	1
But	1
bade	1
them	1
farewell,	1
saying,	1
I	1
must	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
keep	1
this	1
feast	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
God	1
will.	1
And	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
gone	1
up,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
church,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Antioch.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
there,	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Galatia	1
and	1
Phrygia	1
in	1
order,	1
strengthening	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Apollos,	1
born	1
at	1
Alexandria,	1
an	1
eloquent	1
man,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:25	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
instructed	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
being	1
fervent	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
taught	1
diligently	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
knowing	1
only	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
whom	1
when	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
had	1
heard,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
expounded	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
brethren	1
wrote,	1
exhorting	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
receive	1
him:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
helped	1
them	1
much	1
which	1
had	1
believed	1
through	1
grace:	1
18:28	1
For	1
he	1
mightily	1
convinced	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
that	1
publickly,	1
shewing	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
Apollos	1
was	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
Paul	1
having	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
coasts	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus:	1
and	1
finding	1
certain	1
disciples,	1
19:2	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
since	1
ye	1
believed?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
heard	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
what	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Unto	1
John's	1
baptism.	1
	1
19:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
John	1
verily	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance,	1
saying	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
after	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:5	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
came	1
on	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
about	1
twelve.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
spake	1
boldly	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
months,	1
disputing	1
and	1
persuading	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:9	1
But	1
when	1
divers	1
were	1
hardened,	1
and	1
believed	1
not,	1
but	1
spake	1
evil	1
of	1
that	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
separated	1
the	1
disciples,	1
disputing	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
one	1
Tyrannus.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
this	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Asia	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
God	1
wrought	1
special	1
miracles	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Paul:	1
19:12	1
So	1
that	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
handkerchiefs	1
or	1
aprons,	1
and	1
the	1
diseases	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
vagabond	1
Jews,	1
exorcists,	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
evil	1
spirits	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
We	1
adjure	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
Paul	1
preacheth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
Sceva,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
Paul	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
ye?	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaped	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
overcame	1
them,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
naked	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks	1
also	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Ephesus;	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
was	1
magnified.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
many	1
that	1
believed	1
came,	1
and	1
confessed,	1
and	1
shewed	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
19:19	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
used	1
curious	1
arts	1
brought	1
their	1
books	1
together,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
before	1
all	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
counted	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
19:20	1
So	1
mightily	1
grew	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prevailed.	1
	1
19:21	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
ended,	1
Paul	1
purposed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there,	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
see	1
Rome.	1
	1
19:22	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
into	1
Macedonia	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
Timotheus	1
and	1
Erastus;	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
stayed	1
in	1
Asia	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
there	1
arose	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
about	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:24	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Demetrius,	1
a	1
silversmith,	1
which	1
made	1
silver	1
shrines	1
for	1
Diana,	1
brought	1
no	1
small	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
craftsmen;	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
he	1
called	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
workmen	1
of	1
like	1
occupation,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
craft	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
wealth.	1
	1
19:26	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
that	1
not	1
alone	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
but	1
almost	1
throughout	1
all	1
Asia,	1
this	1
Paul	1
hath	1
persuaded	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
much	1
people,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
no	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
with	1
hands:	1
19:27	1
So	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
our	1
craft	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought;	1
but	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana	1
should	1
be	1
despised,	1
and	1
her	1
magnificence	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
whom	1
all	1
Asia	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
worshippeth.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
sayings,	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
wrath,	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
confusion:	1
and	1
having	1
caught	1
Gaius	1
and	1
Aristarchus,	1
men	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul's	1
companions	1
in	1
travel,	1
they	1
rushed	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
disciples	1
suffered	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
Asia,	1
which	1
were	1
his	1
friends,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
adventure	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:32	1
Some	1
therefore	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
some	1
another:	1
for	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
confused:	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
knew	1
not	1
wherefore	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
Alexander	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
the	1
Jews	1
putting	1
him	1
forward.	1
And	1
Alexander	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
defence	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew,	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
cried	1
out,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
townclerk	1
had	1
appeased	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians	1
is	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
Jupiter?	1
	1
19:36	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
cannot	1
be	1
spoken	1
against,	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly.	1
	1
19:37	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
hither	1
these	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
neither	1
robbers	1
of	1
churches,	1
nor	1
yet	1
blasphemers	1
of	1
your	1
goddess.	1
	1
19:38	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
Demetrius,	1
and	1
the	1
craftsmen	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
have	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
any	1
man,	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
deputies:	1
let	1
them	1
implead	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
19:39	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
enquire	1
any	1
thing	1
concerning	1
other	1
matters,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
determined	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
assembly.	1
	1
19:40	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
for	1
this	1
day's	1
uproar,	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
cause	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
concourse.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
dismissed	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
uproar	1
was	1
ceased,	1
Paul	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
those	1
parts,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
much	1
exhortation,	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
Greece,	1
20:3	1
And	1
there	1
abode	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
into	1
Syria,	1
he	1
purposed	1
to	1
return	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
there	1
accompanied	1
him	1
into	1
Asia	1
Sopater	1
of	1
Berea;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians,	1
Aristarchus	1
and	1
Secundus;	1
and	1
Gaius	1
of	1
Derbe,	1
and	1
Timotheus;	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
Tychicus	1
and	1
Trophimus.	1
	1
20:5	1
These	1
going	1
before	1
tarried	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
Troas.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
Philippi	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
Troas	1
in	1
five	1
days;	1
where	1
we	1
abode	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
break	1
bread,	1
Paul	1
preached	1
unto	1
them,	1
ready	1
to	1
depart	1
on	1
the	1
morrow;	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
until	1
midnight.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
window	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man	1
named	1
Eutychus,	1
being	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep:	1
and	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
long	1
preaching,	1
he	1
sunk	1
down	1
with	1
sleep,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
third	1
loft,	1
and	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Paul	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
said,	1
Trouble	1
not	1
yourselves;	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
When	1
he	1
therefore	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
bread,	1
and	1
eaten,	1
and	1
talked	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
even	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day,	1
so	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
alive,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
comforted.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
we	1
went	1
before	1
to	1
ship,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Assos,	1
there	1
intending	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
Paul:	1
for	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
appointed,	1
minding	1
himself	1
to	1
go	1
afoot.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
Assos,	1
we	1
took	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Mitylene.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
over	1
against	1
Chios;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
Samos,	1
and	1
tarried	1
at	1
Trogyllium;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Miletus.	1
	1
20:16	1
For	1
Paul	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
Ephesus,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Asia:	1
for	1
he	1
hasted,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
from	1
Miletus	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Asia,	1
after	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
seasons,	1
20:19	1
Serving	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
humility	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
tears,	1
and	1
temptations,	1
which	1
befell	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
20:20	1
And	1
how	1
I	1
kept	1
back	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
profitable	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
have	1
shewed	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
publickly,	1
and	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
20:21	1
Testifying	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
repentance	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
faith	1
toward	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
go	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
befall	1
me	1
there:	1
20:23	1
Save	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
witnesseth	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
saying	1
that	1
bonds	1
and	1
afflictions	1
abide	1
me.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
move	1
me,	1
neither	1
count	1
I	1
my	1
life	1
dear	1
unto	1
myself,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
finish	1
my	1
course	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
ministry,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
all,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
20:26	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
record	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
pure	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
20:27	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shunned	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:28	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
flock,	1
over	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
overseers,	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purchased	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood.	1
	1
20:29	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
departing	1
shall	1
grievous	1
wolves	1
enter	1
in	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
sparing	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
20:30	1
Also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
shall	1
men	1
arise,	1
speaking	1
perverse	1
things,	1
to	1
draw	1
away	1
disciples	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
20:31	1
Therefore	1
watch,	1
and	1
remember,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
warn	1
every	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
commend	1
you	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
you	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
20:33	1
I	1
have	1
coveted	1
no	1
man's	1
silver,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
apparel.	1
	1
20:34	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know,	1
that	1
these	1
hands	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
my	1
necessities,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:35	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
how	1
that	1
so	1
labouring	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
how	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
blessed	1
to	1
give	1
than	1
to	1
receive.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed	1
with	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
wept	1
sore,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
Paul's	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
20:38	1
Sorrowing	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
accompanied	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
gotten	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
launched,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
unto	1
Coos,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
unto	1
Rhodes,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
Patara:	1
21:2	1
And	1
finding	1
a	1
ship	1
sailing	1
over	1
unto	1
Phenicia,	1
we	1
went	1
aboard,	1
and	1
set	1
forth.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
discovered	1
Cyprus,	1
we	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
sailed	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
landed	1
at	1
Tyre:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
to	1
unlade	1
her	1
burden.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
finding	1
disciples,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
seven	1
days:	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
Paul	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
accomplished	1
those	1
days,	1
we	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
our	1
way;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
brought	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way,	1
with	1
wives	1
and	1
children,	1
till	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
we	1
kneeled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
our	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
we	1
took	1
ship;	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
again.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
our	1
course	1
from	1
Tyre,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Ptolemais,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
Paul's	1
company	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea:	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Philip	1
the	1
evangelist,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven;	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
had	1
four	1
daughters,	1
virgins,	1
which	1
did	1
prophesy.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
a	1
certain	1
prophet,	1
named	1
Agabus.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
us,	1
he	1
took	1
Paul's	1
girdle,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
Jews	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
bind	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
owneth	1
this	1
girdle,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
besought	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:13	1
Then	1
Paul	1
answered,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
mine	1
heart?	1
	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
die	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
we	1
ceased,	1
saying,	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
we	1
took	1
up	1
our	1
carriages,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:16	1
There	1
went	1
with	1
us	1
also	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
Mnason	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
an	1
old	1
disciple,	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
should	1
lodge.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
brethren	1
received	1
us	1
gladly.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
Paul	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
James;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
saluted	1
them,	1
he	1
declared	1
particularly	1
what	1
things	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
his	1
ministry.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest,	1
brother,	1
how	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Jews	1
there	1
are	1
which	1
believe;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
21:21	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
informed	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
teachest	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
forsake	1
Moses,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
circumcise	1
their	1
children,	1
neither	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
customs.	1
	1
21:22	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
therefore?	1
the	1
multitude	1
must	1
needs	1
come	1
together:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
	1
21:23	1
Do	1
therefore	1
this	1
that	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
thee:	1
We	1
have	1
four	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
vow	1
on	1
them;	1
21:24	1
Them	1
take,	1
and	1
purify	1
thyself	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
charges	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
shave	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
those	1
things,	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
informed	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
are	1
nothing;	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
also	1
walkest	1
orderly,	1
and	1
keepest	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
21:25	1
As	1
touching	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
believe,	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
concluded	1
that	1
they	1
observe	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
save	1
only	1
that	1
they	1
keep	1
themselves	1
from	1
things	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication.	1
	1
21:26	1
Then	1
Paul	1
took	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
purifying	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
purification,	1
until	1
that	1
an	1
offering	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
almost	1
ended,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Asia,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
stirred	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
21:28	1
Crying	1
out,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
help:	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
teacheth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
this	1
place:	1
and	1
further	1
brought	1
Greeks	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
hath	1
polluted	1
this	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
21:29	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
Trophimus	1
an	1
Ephesian,	1
whom	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
temple.)	1
21:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut.	1
	1
21:31	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
tidings	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
band,	1
that	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
uproar.	1
	1
21:32	1
Who	1
immediately	1
took	1
soldiers	1
and	1
centurions,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
they	1
left	1
beating	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
21:33	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains;	1
and	1
demanded	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
some	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
some	1
another,	1
among	1
the	1
multitude:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
tumult,	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:36	1
For	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
after,	1
crying,	1
Away	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
Who	1
said,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
speak	1
Greek?	1
	1
21:38	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
that	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
madest	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
leddest	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
murderers?	1
	1
21:39	1
But	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
no	1
mean	1
city:	1
and,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
licence,	1
Paul	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
silence,	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
saying,	1
22:1	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hear	1
ye	1
my	1
defence	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
now	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
22:2	1
(And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
more	1
silence:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,)	1
22:3	1
I	1
am	1
verily	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew,	1
born	1
in	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
yet	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Gamaliel,	1
and	1
taught	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
perfect	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
zealous	1
toward	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
I	1
persecuted	1
this	1
way	1
unto	1
the	1
death,	1
binding	1
and	1
delivering	1
into	1
prisons	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
22:5	1
As	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
doth	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
elders:	1
from	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
received	1
letters	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
punished.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Damascus	1
about	1
noon,	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shone	1
from	1
heaven	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
round	1
about	1
me.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
indeed	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid;	1
but	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
LORD?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Damascus;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
light,	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
one	1
Ananias,	1
a	1
devout	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
22:13	1
Came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
I	1
looked	1
up	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
know	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
Just	1
One,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
his	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
now	1
why	1
tarriest	1
thou?	1
arise,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
wash	1
away	1
thy	1
sins,	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
while	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
trance;	1
22:18	1
And	1
saw	1
him	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
thy	1
testimony	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
imprisoned	1
and	1
beat	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
on	1
thee:	1
22:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
martyr	1
Stephen	1
was	1
shed,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Depart:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
far	1
hence	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
audience	1
unto	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Away	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
live.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
threw	1
dust	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
22:24	1
The	1
chief	1
captain	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
bade	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
scourging;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
so	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
thongs,	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
scourge	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
uncondemned?	1
	1
22:26	1
When	1
the	1
centurion	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
thou	1
doest:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
22:27	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
art	1
thou	1
a	1
Roman?	1
He	1
said,	1
Yea.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
answered,	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
sum	1
obtained	1
I	1
this	1
freedom.	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
free	1
born.	1
	1
22:29	1
Then	1
straightway	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
examined	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
also	1
was	1
afraid,	1
after	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
bound	1
him.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
certainty	1
wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
loosed	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
bands,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
council	1
to	1
appear,	1
and	1
brought	1
Paul	1
down,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Paul,	1
earnestly	1
beholding	1
the	1
council,	1
said,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
Ananias	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee,	1
thou	1
whited	1
wall:	1
for	1
sittest	1
thou	1
to	1
judge	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
commandest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said,	1
Revilest	1
thou	1
God's	1
high	1
priest?	1
	1
23:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
wist	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
were	1
Sadducees,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Pharisees,	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Pharisee:	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
and	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
dissension	1
between	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees:	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
was	1
divided.	1
	1
23:8	1
For	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
neither	1
angel,	1
nor	1
spirit:	1
but	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
confess	1
both.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
cry:	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees'	1
part	1
arose,	1
and	1
strove,	1
saying,	1
We	1
find	1
no	1
evil	1
in	1
this	1
man:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
spirit	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
dissension,	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
Paul	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
pulled	1
in	1
pieces	1
of	1
them,	1
commanded	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
the	1
night	1
following	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
Paul:	1
for	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
testified	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
must	1
thou	1
bear	1
witness	1
also	1
at	1
Rome.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
banded	1
together,	1
and	1
bound	1
themselves	1
under	1
a	1
curse,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
conspiracy.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
curse,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
eat	1
nothing	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
slain	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
council	1
signify	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
that	1
he	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
morrow,	1
as	1
though	1
ye	1
would	1
enquire	1
something	1
more	1
perfectly	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
we,	1
or	1
ever	1
he	1
come	1
near,	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
when	1
Paul's	1
sister's	1
son	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
told	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
Paul	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
centurions	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
23:18	1
So	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
and	1
said,	1
Paul	1
the	1
prisoner	1
called	1
me	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
prayed	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
thee,	1
who	1
hath	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
aside	1
privately,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
tell	1
me?	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
Jews	1
have	1
agreed	1
to	1
desire	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
bring	1
down	1
Paul	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
the	1
council,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
enquire	1
somewhat	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
yield	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
men,	1
which	1
have	1
bound	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
him:	1
and	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
ready,	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
promise	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
23:22	1
So	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
then	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
depart,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
centurions,	1
saying,	1
Make	1
ready	1
two	1
hundred	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
horsemen	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten,	1
and	1
spearmen	1
two	1
hundred,	1
at	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night;	1
23:24	1
And	1
provide	1
them	1
beasts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
set	1
Paul	1
on,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
safe	1
unto	1
Felix	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
23:26	1
Claudius	1
Lysias	1
unto	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
governor	1
Felix	1
sendeth	1
greeting.	1
	1
23:27	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
of	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
I	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
rescued	1
him,	1
having	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
they	1
accused	1
him,	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
their	1
council:	1
23:29	1
Whom	1
I	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
of	1
questions	1
of	1
their	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
laid	1
to	1
his	1
charge	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
sent	1
straightway	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
his	1
accusers	1
also	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
thee	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
against	1
him.	1
Farewell.	1
	1
23:31	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them,	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
Antipatris.	1
	1
23:32	1
On	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
horsemen	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
castle:	1
23:33	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle	1
to	1
the	1
governor,	1
presented	1
Paul	1
also	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
what	1
province	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Cilicia;	1
23:35	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
thee,	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
thine	1
accusers	1
are	1
also	1
come.	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
Herod's	1
judgment	1
hall.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
after	1
five	1
days	1
Ananias	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
descended	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
orator	1
named	1
Tertullus,	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
governor	1
against	1
Paul.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
forth,	1
Tertullus	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Seeing	1
that	1
by	1
thee	1
we	1
enjoy	1
great	1
quietness,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
are	1
done	1
unto	1
this	1
nation	1
by	1
thy	1
providence,	1
24:3	1
We	1
accept	1
it	1
always,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places,	1
most	1
noble	1
Felix,	1
with	1
all	1
thankfulness.	1
	1
24:4	1
Notwithstanding,	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
further	1
tedious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
hear	1
us	1
of	1
thy	1
clemency	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
pestilent	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
mover	1
of	1
sedition	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
throughout	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
ringleader	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarenes:	1
24:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
gone	1
about	1
to	1
profane	1
the	1
temple:	1
whom	1
we	1
took,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
law.	1
	1
24:7	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
Lysias	1
came	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
24:8	1
Commanding	1
his	1
accusers	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
by	1
examining	1
of	1
whom	1
thyself	1
mayest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
whereof	1
we	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
assented,	1
saying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
24:10	1
Then	1
Paul,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
speak,	1
answered,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
judge	1
unto	1
this	1
nation,	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
more	1
cheerfully	1
answer	1
for	1
myself:	1
24:11	1
Because	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
understand,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
yet	1
but	1
twelve	1
days	1
since	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
neither	1
found	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
disputing	1
with	1
any	1
man,	1
neither	1
raising	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
city:	1
24:13	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
prove	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
they	1
now	1
accuse	1
me.	1
	1
24:14	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
confess	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
heresy,	1
so	1
worship	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
believing	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets:	1
24:15	1
And	1
have	1
hope	1
toward	1
God,	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
also	1
allow,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
unjust.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
herein	1
do	1
I	1
exercise	1
myself,	1
to	1
have	1
always	1
a	1
conscience	1
void	1
to	1
offence	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
24:17	1
Now	1
after	1
many	1
years	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
bring	1
alms	1
to	1
my	1
nation,	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
24:18	1
Whereupon	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Asia	1
found	1
me	1
purified	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
neither	1
with	1
multitude,	1
nor	1
with	1
tumult.	1
	1
24:19	1
Who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
object,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
ought	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
24:20	1
Or	1
else	1
let	1
these	1
same	1
here	1
say,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
found	1
any	1
evil	1
doing	1
in	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
council,	1
24:21	1
Except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
voice,	1
that	1
I	1
cried	1
standing	1
among	1
them,	1
Touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
by	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
when	1
Felix	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
having	1
more	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
deferred	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Lysias	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
I	1
will	1
know	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
your	1
matter.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
a	1
centurion	1
to	1
keep	1
Paul,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
liberty,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
forbid	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
minister	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days,	1
when	1
Felix	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Drusilla,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
Paul,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
reasoned	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
temperance,	1
and	1
judgment	1
to	1
come,	1
Felix	1
trembled,	1
and	1
answered,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way	1
for	1
this	1
time;	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
convenient	1
season,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
24:26	1
He	1
hoped	1
also	1
that	1
money	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
Paul,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
loose	1
him:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
oftener,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:27	1
But	1
after	1
two	1
years	1
Porcius	1
Festus	1
came	1
into	1
Felix'	1
room:	1
and	1
Felix,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
left	1
Paul	1
bound.	1
	1
25:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Festus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
province,	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
ascended	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
25:2	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
him	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
25:3	1
And	1
desired	1
favour	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
laying	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
25:4	1
But	1
Festus	1
answered,	1
that	1
Paul	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
depart	1
shortly	1
thither.	1
	1
25:5	1
Let	1
them	1
therefore,	1
said	1
he,	1
which	1
among	1
you	1
are	1
able,	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
accuse	1
this	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wickedness	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tarried	1
among	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
days,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
Caesarea;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
commanded	1
Paul	1
to	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
laid	1
many	1
and	1
grievous	1
complaints	1
against	1
Paul,	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
prove.	1
	1
25:8	1
While	1
he	1
answered	1
for	1
himself,	1
Neither	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
neither	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
nor	1
yet	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
Festus,	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
answered	1
Paul,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
25:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
Caesar's	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
where	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
judged:	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
wrong,	1
as	1
thou	1
very	1
well	1
knowest.	1
	1
25:11	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
an	1
offender,	1
or	1
have	1
committed	1
any	1
thing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
whereof	1
these	1
accuse	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
deliver	1
me	1
unto	1
them.	1
I	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:12	1
Then	1
Festus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
with	1
the	1
council,	1
answered,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar?	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days	1
king	1
Agrippa	1
and	1
Bernice	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
salute	1
Festus.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
Festus	1
declared	1
Paul's	1
cause	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
bonds	1
by	1
Felix:	1
25:15	1
About	1
whom,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
me,	1
desiring	1
to	1
have	1
judgment	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:16	1
To	1
whom	1
I	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Romans	1
to	1
deliver	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
die,	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
accused	1
have	1
the	1
accusers	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
have	1
licence	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
himself	1
concerning	1
the	1
crime	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:17	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
hither,	1
without	1
any	1
delay	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:18	1
Against	1
whom	1
when	1
the	1
accusers	1
stood	1
up,	1
they	1
brought	1
none	1
accusation	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
I	1
supposed:	1
25:19	1
But	1
had	1
certain	1
questions	1
against	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
superstition,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
whom	1
Paul	1
affirmed	1
to	1
be	1
alive.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
doubted	1
of	1
such	1
manner	1
of	1
questions,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
matters.	1
	1
25:21	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
till	1
I	1
might	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:22	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
I	1
would	1
also	1
hear	1
the	1
man	1
myself.	1
To	1
morrow,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
Agrippa	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
with	1
great	1
pomp,	1
and	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
hearing,	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
principal	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
at	1
Festus'	1
commandment	1
Paul	1
was	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
Festus	1
said,	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
here	1
present	1
with	1
us,	1
ye	1
see	1
this	1
man,	1
about	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
me,	1
both	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
also	1
here,	1
crying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
any	1
longer.	1
	1
25:25	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
appealed	1
to	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
him.	1
	1
25:26	1
Of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
specially	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
that,	1
after	1
examination	1
had,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
write.	1
	1
25:27	1
For	1
it	1
seemeth	1
to	1
me	1
unreasonable	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
not	1
withal	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
crimes	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
26:1	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Thou	1
art	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
answered	1
for	1
himself:	1
26:2	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
happy,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
because	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
thee	1
touching	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
26:3	1
Especially	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
expert	1
in	1
all	1
customs	1
and	1
questions	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Jews:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
patiently.	1
	1
26:4	1
My	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
my	1
youth,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
mine	1
own	1
nation	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
Jews;	1
26:5	1
Which	1
knew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
testify,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
straitest	1
sect	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
I	1
lived	1
a	1
Pharisee.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
am	1
judged	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers:	1
26:7	1
Unto	1
which	1
promise	1
our	1
twelve	1
tribes,	1
instantly	1
serving	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
hope	1
to	1
come.	1
For	1
which	1
hope's	1
sake,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
26:8	1
Why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
incredible	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
raise	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
26:9	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
many	1
things	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:10	1
Which	1
thing	1
I	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
did	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
prison,	1
having	1
received	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
voice	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
punished	1
them	1
oft	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
compelled	1
them	1
to	1
blaspheme;	1
and	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
mad	1
against	1
them,	1
I	1
persecuted	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
strange	1
cities.	1
	1
26:12	1
Whereupon	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
commission	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:13	1
At	1
midday,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven,	1
above	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
shining	1
round	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
26:16	1
But	1
rise,	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
purpose,	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
minister	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
thee;	1
26:17	1
Delivering	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
unto	1
whom	1
now	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
26:18	1
To	1
open	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
darkness	1
to	1
light,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
inheritance	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
26:19	1
Whereupon,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
disobedient	1
unto	1
the	1
heavenly	1
vision:	1
26:20	1
But	1
shewed	1
first	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
works	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance.	1
	1
26:21	1
For	1
these	1
causes	1
the	1
Jews	1
caught	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
Having	1
therefore	1
obtained	1
help	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
continue	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
witnessing	1
both	1
to	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
saying	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
Moses	1
did	1
say	1
should	1
come:	1
26:23	1
That	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
should	1
shew	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
thus	1
spake	1
for	1
himself,	1
Festus	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Paul,	1
thou	1
art	1
beside	1
thyself;	1
much	1
learning	1
doth	1
make	1
thee	1
mad.	1
	1
26:25	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mad,	1
most	1
noble	1
Festus;	1
but	1
speak	1
forth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness.	1
	1
26:26	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
knoweth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
before	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
speak	1
freely:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
hidden	1
from	1
him;	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
	1
26:27	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
believest	1
thou	1
the	1
prophets?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
believest.	1
	1
26:28	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Almost	1
thou	1
persuadest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
thou,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
were	1
both	1
almost,	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
except	1
these	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
them:	1
26:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
aside,	1
they	1
talked	1
between	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
doeth	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Agrippa	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
This	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
at	1
liberty,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sail	1
into	1
Italy,	1
they	1
delivered	1
Paul	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
prisoners	1
unto	1
one	1
named	1
Julius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
Augustus'	1
band.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Adramyttium,	1
we	1
launched,	1
meaning	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Asia;	1
one	1
Aristarchus,	1
a	1
Macedonian	1
of	1
Thessalonica,	1
being	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
touched	1
at	1
Sidon.	1
And	1
Julius	1
courteously	1
entreated	1
Paul,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
liberty	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
refresh	1
himself.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
launched	1
from	1
thence,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Cyprus,	1
because	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
contrary.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Myra,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Lycia.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
centurion	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria	1
sailing	1
into	1
Italy;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
therein.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
slowly	1
many	1
days,	1
and	1
scarce	1
were	1
come	1
over	1
against	1
Cnidus,	1
the	1
wind	1
not	1
suffering	1
us,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Crete,	1
over	1
against	1
Salmone;	1
27:8	1
And,	1
hardly	1
passing	1
it,	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
fair	1
havens;	1
nigh	1
whereunto	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lasea.	1
	1
27:9	1
Now	1
when	1
much	1
time	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
when	1
sailing	1
was	1
now	1
dangerous,	1
because	1
the	1
fast	1
was	1
now	1
already	1
past,	1
Paul	1
admonished	1
them,	1
27:10	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sirs,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
voyage	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
hurt	1
and	1
much	1
damage,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
lading	1
and	1
ship,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
	1
27:11	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
centurion	1
believed	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
more	1
than	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
haven	1
was	1
not	1
commodious	1
to	1
winter	1
in,	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
advised	1
to	1
depart	1
thence	1
also,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
attain	1
to	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
winter;	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
Crete,	1
and	1
lieth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
west	1
and	1
north	1
west.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew	1
softly,	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
their	1
purpose,	1
loosing	1
thence,	1
they	1
sailed	1
close	1
by	1
Crete.	1
	1
27:14	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
there	1
arose	1
against	1
it	1
a	1
tempestuous	1
wind,	1
called	1
Euroclydon.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
caught,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
we	1
let	1
her	1
drive.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
running	1
under	1
a	1
certain	1
island	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Clauda,	1
we	1
had	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
boat:	1
27:17	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
used	1
helps,	1
undergirding	1
the	1
ship;	1
and,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
quicksands,	1
strake	1
sail,	1
and	1
so	1
were	1
driven.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
we	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
tossed	1
with	1
a	1
tempest,	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship;	1
27:19	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
we	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
the	1
tackling	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
when	1
neither	1
sun	1
nor	1
stars	1
in	1
many	1
days	1
appeared,	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
tempest	1
lay	1
on	1
us,	1
all	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
was	1
then	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
after	1
long	1
abstinence	1
Paul	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
loosed	1
from	1
Crete,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
this	1
harm	1
and	1
loss.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
loss	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
life	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:23	1
For	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
me	1
this	1
night	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
serve,	1
27:24	1
Saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Paul;	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Caesar:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sail	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
27:25	1
Wherefore,	1
sirs,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
God,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me.	1
	1
27:26	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
island.	1
	1
27:27	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
night	1
was	1
come,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
Adria,	1
about	1
midnight	1
the	1
shipmen	1
deemed	1
that	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
some	1
country;	1
27:28	1
And	1
sounded,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
twenty	1
fathoms:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
further,	1
they	1
sounded	1
again,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifteen	1
fathoms.	1
	1
27:29	1
Then	1
fearing	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
upon	1
rocks,	1
they	1
cast	1
four	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
shipmen	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
boat	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
under	1
colour	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
cast	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foreship,	1
27:31	1
Paul	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
centurion	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
Except	1
these	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
27:32	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
fall	1
off.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
coming	1
on,	1
Paul	1
besought	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
take	1
meat,	1
saying,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
tarried	1
and	1
continued	1
fasting,	1
having	1
taken	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:34	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
meat:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
health:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
it,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
27:36	1
Then	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
some	1
meat.	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
two	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
sixteen	1
souls.	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
enough,	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
certain	1
creek	1
with	1
a	1
shore,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
minded,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
to	1
thrust	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:40	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
anchors,	1
they	1
committed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
loosed	1
the	1
rudder	1
bands,	1
and	1
hoised	1
up	1
the	1
mainsail	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
made	1
toward	1
shore.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
seas	1
met,	1
they	1
ran	1
the	1
ship	1
aground;	1
and	1
the	1
forepart	1
stuck	1
fast,	1
and	1
remained	1
unmoveable,	1
but	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
was	1
broken	1
with	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
waves.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
counsel	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
swim	1
out,	1
and	1
escape.	1
	1
27:43	1
But	1
the	1
centurion,	1
willing	1
to	1
save	1
Paul,	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
purpose;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
could	1
swim	1
should	1
cast	1
themselves	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
land:	1
27:44	1
And	1
the	1
rest,	1
some	1
on	1
boards,	1
and	1
some	1
on	1
broken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
escaped	1
all	1
safe	1
to	1
land.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
escaped,	1
then	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
was	1
called	1
Melita.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
the	1
barbarous	1
people	1
shewed	1
us	1
no	1
little	1
kindness:	1
for	1
they	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
received	1
us	1
every	1
one,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
rain,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cold.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
viper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
barbarians	1
saw	1
the	1
venomous	1
beast	1
hang	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
No	1
doubt	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
murderer,	1
whom,	1
though	1
he	1
hath	1
escaped	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
vengeance	1
suffereth	1
not	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
beast	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
28:6	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
looked	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
swollen,	1
or	1
fallen	1
down	1
dead	1
suddenly:	1
but	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
a	1
great	1
while,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
harm	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god.	1
	1
28:7	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
quarters	1
were	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Publius;	1
who	1
received	1
us,	1
and	1
lodged	1
us	1
three	1
days	1
courteously.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Publius	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
bloody	1
flux:	1
to	1
whom	1
Paul	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
28:9	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
others	1
also,	1
which	1
had	1
diseases	1
in	1
the	1
island,	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
healed:	1
28:10	1
Who	1
also	1
honoured	1
us	1
with	1
many	1
honours;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
departed,	1
they	1
laded	1
us	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
necessary.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
months	1
we	1
departed	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria,	1
which	1
had	1
wintered	1
in	1
the	1
isle,	1
whose	1
sign	1
was	1
Castor	1
and	1
Pollux.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
landing	1
at	1
Syracuse,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
we	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Rhegium:	1
and	1
after	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Puteoli:	1
28:14	1
Where	1
we	1
found	1
brethren,	1
and	1
were	1
desired	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
toward	1
Rome.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Appii	1
forum,	1
and	1
The	1
three	1
taverns:	1
whom	1
when	1
Paul	1
saw,	1
he	1
thanked	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
courage.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Rome,	1
the	1
centurion	1
delivered	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard:	1
but	1
Paul	1
was	1
suffered	1
to	1
dwell	1
by	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
soldier	1
that	1
kept	1
him.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
Paul	1
called	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
together:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
customs	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
yet	1
was	1
I	1
delivered	1
prisoner	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Romans.	1
	1
28:18	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
examined	1
me,	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
28:19	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
spake	1
against	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ought	1
to	1
accuse	1
my	1
nation	1
of.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
with	1
this	1
chain.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
neither	1
received	1
letters	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
came	1
shewed	1
or	1
spake	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
28:22	1
But	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
thinkest:	1
for	1
as	1
concerning	1
this	1
sect,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
spoken	1
against.	1
	1
28:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
him	1
a	1
day,	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
lodging;	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
expounded	1
and	1
testified	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
persuading	1
them	1
concerning	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
evening.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
some	1
believed	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken,	1
and	1
some	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
28:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
agreed	1
not	1
among	1
themselves,	1
they	1
departed,	1
after	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
spoken	1
one	1
word,	1
Well	1
spake	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers,	1
28:26	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive:	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
have	1
they	1
closed;	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
28:28	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
28:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Jews	1
departed,	1
and	1
had	1
great	1
reasoning	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
28:30	1
And	1
Paul	1
dwelt	1
two	1
whole	1
years	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hired	1
house,	1
and	1
received	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
28:31	1
Preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
teaching	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
with	1
all	1
confidence,	1
no	1
man	1
forbidding	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Romans	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle,	1
separated	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
1:2	1
(Which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
afore	1
by	1
his	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,)	1
1:3	1
Concerning	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
1:4	1
And	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
power,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
holiness,	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:5	1
By	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
grace	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
for	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
for	1
his	1
name:	1
1:6	1
Among	1
whom	1
are	1
ye	1
also	1
the	1
called	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
To	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Rome,	1
beloved	1
of	1
God,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints:	1
Grace	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
First,	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:10	1
Making	1
request,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
now	1
at	1
length	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
prosperous	1
journey	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
impart	1
unto	1
you	1
some	1
spiritual	1
gift,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
established;	1
1:12	1
That	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
comforted	1
together	1
with	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
faith	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
oftentimes	1
I	1
purposed	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
(but	1
was	1
let	1
hitherto,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
fruit	1
among	1
you	1
also,	1
even	1
as	1
among	1
other	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
am	1
debtor	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Barbarians;	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unwise.	1
	1
1:15	1
So,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
me	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Rome	1
also.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
salvation	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth;	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greek.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
therein	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
revealed	1
from	1
faith	1
to	1
faith:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
against	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
unrighteousness	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
hold	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
unrighteousness;	1
1:19	1
Because	1
that	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
known	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
manifest	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
it	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
invisible	1
things	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
clearly	1
seen,	1
being	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
even	1
his	1
eternal	1
power	1
and	1
Godhead;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
excuse:	1
1:21	1
Because	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
God,	1
they	1
glorified	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
God,	1
neither	1
were	1
thankful;	1
but	1
became	1
vain	1
in	1
their	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
their	1
foolish	1
heart	1
was	1
darkened.	1
	1
1:22	1
Professing	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
wise,	1
they	1
became	1
fools,	1
1:23	1
And	1
changed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
uncorruptible	1
God	1
into	1
an	1
image	1
made	1
like	1
to	1
corruptible	1
man,	1
and	1
to	1
birds,	1
and	1
fourfooted	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things.	1
	1
1:24	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
to	1
dishonour	1
their	1
own	1
bodies	1
between	1
themselves:	1
1:25	1
Who	1
changed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
creature	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Creator,	1
who	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
vile	1
affections:	1
for	1
even	1
their	1
women	1
did	1
change	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
into	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
against	1
nature:	1
1:27	1
And	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
men,	1
leaving	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
burned	1
in	1
their	1
lust	1
one	1
toward	1
another;	1
men	1
with	1
men	1
working	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
recompence	1
of	1
their	1
error	1
which	1
was	1
meet.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
retain	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
knowledge,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
reprobate	1
mind,	1
to	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient;	1
1:29	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
unrighteousness,	1
fornication,	1
wickedness,	1
covetousness,	1
maliciousness;	1
full	1
of	1
envy,	1
murder,	1
debate,	1
deceit,	1
malignity;	1
whisperers,	1
1:30	1
Backbiters,	1
haters	1
of	1
God,	1
despiteful,	1
proud,	1
boasters,	1
inventors	1
of	1
evil	1
things,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
1:31	1
Without	1
understanding,	1
covenantbreakers,	1
without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
implacable,	1
unmerciful:	1
1:32	1
Who	1
knowing	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
inexcusable,	1
O	1
man,	1
whosoever	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
judgest:	1
for	1
wherein	1
thou	1
judgest	1
another,	1
thou	1
condemnest	1
thyself;	1
for	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
doest	1
the	1
same	1
things.	1
	1
2:2	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
truth	1
against	1
them	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
this,	1
O	1
man,	1
that	1
judgest	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
doest	1
the	1
same,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
2:4	1
Or	1
despisest	1
thou	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
forbearance	1
and	1
longsuffering;	1
not	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
to	1
repentance?	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
after	1
thy	1
hardness	1
and	1
impenitent	1
heart	1
treasurest	1
up	1
unto	1
thyself	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
will	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
deeds:	1
2:7	1
To	1
them	1
who	1
by	1
patient	1
continuance	1
in	1
well	1
doing	1
seek	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
immortality,	1
eternal	1
life:	1
2:8	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
contentious,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
obey	1
unrighteousness,	1
indignation	1
and	1
wrath,	1
2:9	1
Tribulation	1
and	1
anguish,	1
upon	1
every	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil,	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentile;	1
2:10	1
But	1
glory,	1
honour,	1
and	1
peace,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
worketh	1
good,	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentile:	1
2:11	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
without	1
law	1
shall	1
also	1
perish	1
without	1
law:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
2:13	1
(For	1
not	1
the	1
hearers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
just	1
before	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
things	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
these,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
are	1
a	1
law	1
unto	1
themselves:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
shew	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
their	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
witness,	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
accusing	1
or	1
else	1
excusing	1
one	1
another;)	1
2:16	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
God	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:17	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
restest	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
God,	1
2:18	1
And	1
knowest	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
approvest	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
more	1
excellent,	1
being	1
instructed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
2:19	1
And	1
art	1
confident	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
art	1
a	1
guide	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
2:20	1
An	1
instructor	1
of	1
the	1
foolish,	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
babes,	1
which	1
hast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:21	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
which	1
teachest	1
another,	1
teachest	1
thou	1
not	1
thyself?	1
thou	1
that	1
preachest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
steal,	1
dost	1
thou	1
steal?	1
	1
2:22	1
Thou	1
that	1
sayest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
adultery?	1
thou	1
that	1
abhorrest	1
idols,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
sacrilege?	1
	1
2:23	1
Thou	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
through	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
dishonourest	1
thou	1
God?	1
	1
2:24	1
For	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
blasphemed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
circumcision	1
verily	1
profiteth,	1
if	1
thou	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breaker	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
thy	1
circumcision	1
is	1
made	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
if	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
keep	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
shall	1
not	1
his	1
uncircumcision	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
circumcision?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
uncircumcision	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
nature,	1
if	1
it	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law,	1
judge	1
thee,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
circumcision	1
dost	1
transgress	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
2:28	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
outwardly;	1
neither	1
is	1
that	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
is	1
outward	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
2:29	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
inwardly;	1
and	1
circumcision	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
What	1
advantage	1
then	1
hath	1
the	1
Jew?	1
or	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
circumcision?	1
	1
3:2	1
Much	1
every	1
way:	1
chiefly,	1
because	1
that	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
committed	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
what	1
if	1
some	1
did	1
not	1
believe?	1
shall	1
their	1
unbelief	1
make	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
effect?	1
	1
3:4	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
let	1
God	1
be	1
true,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
liar;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
thy	1
sayings,	1
and	1
mightest	1
overcome	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
judged.	1
	1
3:5	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
unrighteousness	1
commend	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say?	1
Is	1
God	1
unrighteous	1
who	1
taketh	1
vengeance?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
man)	1
3:6	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
then	1
how	1
shall	1
God	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
more	1
abounded	1
through	1
my	1
lie	1
unto	1
his	1
glory;	1
why	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
also	1
judged	1
as	1
a	1
sinner?	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
not	1
rather,	1
(as	1
we	1
be	1
slanderously	1
reported,	1
and	1
as	1
some	1
affirm	1
that	1
we	1
say,)	1
Let	1
us	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
good	1
may	1
come?	1
whose	1
damnation	1
is	1
just.	1
	1
3:9	1
What	1
then?	1
are	1
we	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
No,	1
in	1
no	1
wise:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
proved	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
under	1
sin;	1
3:10	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
righteous,	1
no,	1
not	1
one:	1
3:11	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
understandeth,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
seeketh	1
after	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
they	1
are	1
together	1
become	1
unprofitable;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
3:13	1
Their	1
throat	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre;	1
with	1
their	1
tongues	1
they	1
have	1
used	1
deceit;	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
asps	1
is	1
under	1
their	1
lips:	1
3:14	1
Whose	1
mouth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
cursing	1
and	1
bitterness:	1
3:15	1
Their	1
feet	1
are	1
swift	1
to	1
shed	1
blood:	1
3:16	1
Destruction	1
and	1
misery	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
ways:	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
known:	1
3:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
3:19	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
the	1
law	1
saith,	1
it	1
saith	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law:	1
that	1
every	1
mouth	1
may	1
be	1
stopped,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
become	1
guilty	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Therefore	1
by	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
manifested,	1
being	1
witnessed	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
3:22	1
Even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
all	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference:	1
3:23	1
For	1
all	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God;	1
3:24	1
Being	1
justified	1
freely	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
3:25	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
propitiation	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
that	1
are	1
past,	1
through	1
the	1
forbearance	1
of	1
God;	1
3:26	1
To	1
declare,	1
I	1
say,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
just,	1
and	1
the	1
justifier	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
believeth	1
in	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
Where	1
is	1
boasting	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
excluded.	1
By	1
what	1
law?	1
of	1
works?	1
Nay:	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
3:28	1
Therefore	1
we	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
faith	1
without	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:29	1
Is	1
he	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only?	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
Yes,	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also:	1
3:30	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
which	1
shall	1
justify	1
the	1
circumcision	1
by	1
faith,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:31	1
Do	1
we	1
then	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
law	1
through	1
faith?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
we	1
establish	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
4:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then	1
that	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
found?	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
if	1
Abraham	1
were	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
to	1
glory;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:4	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
is	1
the	1
reward	1
not	1
reckoned	1
of	1
grace,	1
but	1
of	1
debt.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
not,	1
but	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
justifieth	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
his	1
faith	1
is	1
counted	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:6	1
Even	1
as	1
David	1
also	1
describeth	1
the	1
blessedness	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
whom	1
God	1
imputeth	1
righteousness	1
without	1
works,	1
4:7	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
whose	1
iniquities	1
are	1
forgiven,	1
and	1
whose	1
sins	1
are	1
covered.	1
	1
4:8	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
impute	1
sin.	1
	1
4:9	1
Cometh	1
this	1
blessedness	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
also?	1
for	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
faith	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Abraham	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:10	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
reckoned?	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
or	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
Not	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
but	1
in	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
circumcision,	1
a	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
being	1
uncircumcised:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
circumcised;	1
that	1
righteousness	1
might	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
them	1
also:	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
circumcision	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
that	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
being	1
yet	1
uncircumcised.	1
	1
4:13	1
For	1
the	1
promise,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
seed,	1
through	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
be	1
heirs,	1
faith	1
is	1
made	1
void,	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect:	1
4:15	1
Because	1
the	1
law	1
worketh	1
wrath:	1
for	1
where	1
no	1
law	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
transgression.	1
	1
4:16	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
faith,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
grace;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
promise	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
seed;	1
not	1
to	1
that	1
only	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Abraham;	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
us	1
all,	1
4:17	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,)	1
before	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
believed,	1
even	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
calleth	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were.	1
	1
4:18	1
Who	1
against	1
hope	1
believed	1
in	1
hope,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
being	1
not	1
weak	1
in	1
faith,	1
he	1
considered	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
now	1
dead,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
neither	1
yet	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
Sarah's	1
womb:	1
4:20	1
He	1
staggered	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
unbelief;	1
but	1
was	1
strong	1
in	1
faith,	1
giving	1
glory	1
to	1
God;	1
4:21	1
And	1
being	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
promised,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
perform.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:23	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
written	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
alone,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him;	1
4:24	1
But	1
for	1
us	1
also,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed,	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
4:25	1
Who	1
was	1
delivered	1
for	1
our	1
offences,	1
and	1
was	1
raised	1
again	1
for	1
our	1
justification.	1
	1
5:1	1
Therefore	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
faith,	1
we	1
have	1
peace	1
with	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
5:2	1
By	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
faith	1
into	1
this	1
grace	1
wherein	1
we	1
stand,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
glory	1
in	1
tribulations	1
also:	1
knowing	1
that	1
tribulation	1
worketh	1
patience;	1
5:4	1
And	1
patience,	1
experience;	1
and	1
experience,	1
hope:	1
5:5	1
And	1
hope	1
maketh	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
because	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
shed	1
abroad	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
without	1
strength,	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
scarcely	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
will	1
one	1
die:	1
yet	1
peradventure	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
some	1
would	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
God	1
commendeth	1
his	1
love	1
toward	1
us,	1
in	1
that,	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
sinners,	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:9	1
Much	1
more	1
then,	1
being	1
now	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
blood,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
wrath	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
if,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
enemies,	1
we	1
were	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
much	1
more,	1
being	1
reconciled,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
also	1
joy	1
in	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
received	1
the	1
atonement.	1
	1
5:12	1
Wherefore,	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
death	1
by	1
sin;	1
and	1
so	1
death	1
passed	1
upon	1
all	1
men,	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
have	1
sinned:	1
5:13	1
(For	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
sin	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:14	1
Nevertheless	1
death	1
reigned	1
from	1
Adam	1
to	1
Moses,	1
even	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
sinned	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Adam's	1
transgression,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
offence,	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
free	1
gift.	1
For	1
if	1
through	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
many	1
be	1
dead,	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
gift	1
by	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
one	1
man,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
abounded	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
that	1
sinned,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
condemnation,	1
but	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
is	1
of	1
many	1
offences	1
unto	1
justification.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
if	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
offence	1
death	1
reigned	1
by	1
one;	1
much	1
more	1
they	1
which	1
receive	1
abundance	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
life	1
by	1
one,	1
Jesus	1
Christ.)	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
judgment	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
condemnation;	1
even	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
one	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
justification	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:19	1
For	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
disobedience	1
many	1
were	1
made	1
sinners,	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
one	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
made	1
righteous.	1
	1
5:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
law	1
entered,	1
that	1
the	1
offence	1
might	1
abound.	1
But	1
where	1
sin	1
abounded,	1
grace	1
did	1
much	1
more	1
abound:	1
5:21	1
That	1
as	1
sin	1
hath	1
reigned	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
so	1
might	1
grace	1
reign	1
through	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Shall	1
we	1
continue	1
in	1
sin,	1
that	1
grace	1
may	1
abound?	1
	1
6:2	1
God	1
forbid.	1
How	1
shall	1
we,	1
that	1
are	1
dead	1
to	1
sin,	1
live	1
any	1
longer	1
therein?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
his	1
death?	1
	1
6:4	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
buried	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
baptism	1
into	1
death:	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
by	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
also	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
planted	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection:	1
6:6	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
serve	1
sin.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
dead	1
is	1
freed	1
from	1
sin.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ,	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
6:9	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Christ	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dieth	1
no	1
more;	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
more	1
dominion	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
died	1
unto	1
sin	1
once:	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
liveth,	1
he	1
liveth	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
Likewise	1
reckon	1
ye	1
also	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
dead	1
indeed	1
unto	1
sin,	1
but	1
alive	1
unto	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:12	1
Let	1
not	1
sin	1
therefore	1
reign	1
in	1
your	1
mortal	1
body,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
obey	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:13	1
Neither	1
yield	1
ye	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
unto	1
sin:	1
but	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
God,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
alive	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
sin	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace.	1
	1
6:15	1
What	1
then?	1
shall	1
we	1
sin,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
servants	1
to	1
obey,	1
his	1
servants	1
ye	1
are	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
obey;	1
whether	1
of	1
sin	1
unto	1
death,	1
or	1
of	1
obedience	1
unto	1
righteousness?	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
God	1
be	1
thanked,	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
obeyed	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
Being	1
then	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
ye	1
became	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:19	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
infirmity	1
of	1
your	1
flesh:	1
for	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
yielded	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
to	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
iniquity;	1
even	1
so	1
now	1
yield	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
when	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
ye	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:21	1
What	1
fruit	1
had	1
ye	1
then	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
are	1
now	1
ashamed?	1
	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
6:22	1
But	1
now	1
being	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
and	1
become	1
servants	1
to	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
your	1
fruit	1
unto	1
holiness,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:1	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
(for	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
the	1
law,)	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
hath	1
dominion	1
over	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth?	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
So	1
then	1
if,	1
while	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth,	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
adulteress:	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
law;	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
adulteress,	1
though	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
7:4	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
become	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
sins,	1
which	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
being	1
dead	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
held;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
oldness	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
7:7	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
Nay,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
sin,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
lust,	1
except	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet.	1
	1
7:8	1
But	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
wrought	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
concupiscence.	1
For	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
once:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
commandment	1
came,	1
sin	1
revived,	1
and	1
I	1
died.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
commandment,	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
to	1
life,	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
slew	1
me.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment	1
holy,	1
and	1
just,	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
7:13	1
Was	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
made	1
death	1
unto	1
me?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
But	1
sin,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
appear	1
sin,	1
working	1
death	1
in	1
me	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
that	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
might	1
become	1
exceeding	1
sinful.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
spiritual:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
carnal,	1
sold	1
under	1
sin.	1
	1
7:15	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
allow	1
not:	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
would,	1
that	1
do	1
I	1
not;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
hate,	1
that	1
do	1
I.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
then	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
I	1
consent	1
unto	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
7:17	1
Now	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
(that	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
flesh,)	1
dwelleth	1
no	1
good	1
thing:	1
for	1
to	1
will	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
how	1
to	1
perform	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
I	1
find	1
not.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
that	1
I	1
do.	1
	1
7:20	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
find	1
then	1
a	1
law,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
good,	1
evil	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
the	1
inward	1
man:	1
7:23	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
another	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
members,	1
warring	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
bringing	1
me	1
into	1
captivity	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
members.	1
	1
7:24	1
O	1
wretched	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
death?	1
	1
7:25	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
So	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
I	1
myself	1
serve	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:1	1
There	1
is	1
therefore	1
now	1
no	1
condemnation	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:2	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
do,	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
weak	1
through	1
the	1
flesh,	1
God	1
sending	1
his	1
own	1
Son	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
sinful	1
flesh,	1
and	1
for	1
sin,	1
condemned	1
sin	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
8:4	1
That	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
us,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
do	1
mind	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
to	1
be	1
carnally	1
minded	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
spiritually	1
minded	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:7	1
Because	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
is	1
enmity	1
against	1
God:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
indeed	1
can	1
be.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
cannot	1
please	1
God.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwell	1
in	1
you.	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
because	1
of	1
sin;	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dwell	1
in	1
you,	1
he	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
also	1
quicken	1
your	1
mortal	1
bodies	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:12	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
debtors,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
do	1
mortify	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:15	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
bondage	1
again	1
to	1
fear;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
adoption,	1
whereby	1
we	1
cry,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
beareth	1
witness	1
with	1
our	1
spirit,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
8:17	1
And	1
if	1
children,	1
then	1
heirs;	1
heirs	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
joint-heirs	1
with	1
Christ;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
suffer	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
also	1
glorified	1
together.	1
	1
8:18	1
For	1
I	1
reckon	1
that	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
are	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
8:19	1
For	1
the	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:20	1
For	1
the	1
creature	1
was	1
made	1
subject	1
to	1
vanity,	1
not	1
willingly,	1
but	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
subjected	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
hope,	1
8:21	1
Because	1
the	1
creature	1
itself	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
corruption	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
groaneth	1
and	1
travaileth	1
in	1
pain	1
together	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
they,	1
but	1
ourselves	1
also,	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
we	1
ourselves	1
groan	1
within	1
ourselves,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
adoption,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
8:24	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
hope:	1
but	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
is	1
not	1
hope:	1
for	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
seeth,	1
why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
hope	1
for?	1
	1
8:25	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
hope	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
not,	1
then	1
do	1
we	1
with	1
patience	1
wait	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
8:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
Spirit	1
also	1
helpeth	1
our	1
infirmities:	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
pray	1
for	1
as	1
we	1
ought:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
groanings	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
uttered.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
searcheth	1
the	1
hearts	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
because	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
saints	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
work	1
together	1
for	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
God,	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
called	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
purpose.	1
	1
8:29	1
For	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
foreknow,	1
he	1
also	1
did	1
predestinate	1
to	1
be	1
conformed	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
firstborn	1
among	1
many	1
brethren.	1
	1
8:30	1
Moreover	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
predestinate,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
called:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
called,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
justified:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
justified,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
glorified.	1
	1
8:31	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
then	1
say	1
to	1
these	1
things?	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
8:32	1
He	1
that	1
spared	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
Son,	1
but	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
freely	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
things?	1
	1
8:33	1
Who	1
shall	1
lay	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
God's	1
elect?	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
justifieth.	1
	1
8:34	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth?	1
It	1
is	1
Christ	1
that	1
died,	1
yea	1
rather,	1
that	1
is	1
risen	1
again,	1
who	1
is	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
8:35	1
Who	1
shall	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
tribulation,	1
or	1
distress,	1
or	1
persecution,	1
or	1
famine,	1
or	1
nakedness,	1
or	1
peril,	1
or	1
sword?	1
	1
8:36	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
thy	1
sake	1
we	1
are	1
killed	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
we	1
are	1
accounted	1
as	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
8:37	1
Nay,	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
we	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
conquerors	1
through	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
8:38	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
that	1
neither	1
death,	1
nor	1
life,	1
nor	1
angels,	1
nor	1
principalities,	1
nor	1
powers,	1
nor	1
things	1
present,	1
nor	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
8:39	1
Nor	1
height,	1
nor	1
depth,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
creature,	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
I	1
lie	1
not,	1
my	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
me	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
9:2	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
heaviness	1
and	1
continual	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
9:3	1
For	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
that	1
myself	1
were	1
accursed	1
from	1
Christ	1
for	1
my	1
brethren,	1
my	1
kinsmen	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:4	1
Who	1
are	1
Israelites;	1
to	1
whom	1
pertaineth	1
the	1
adoption,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
covenants,	1
and	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
promises;	1
9:5	1
Whose	1
are	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
as	1
concerning	1
the	1
flesh	1
Christ	1
came,	1
who	1
is	1
over	1
all,	1
God	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
9:6	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
none	1
effect.	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:7	1
Neither,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
children:	1
but,	1
In	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
9:8	1
That	1
is,	1
They	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
are	1
counted	1
for	1
the	1
seed.	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
promise,	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
this;	1
but	1
when	1
Rebecca	1
also	1
had	1
conceived	1
by	1
one,	1
even	1
by	1
our	1
father	1
Isaac;	1
9:11	1
(For	1
the	1
children	1
being	1
not	1
yet	1
born,	1
neither	1
having	1
done	1
any	1
good	1
or	1
evil,	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
election	1
might	1
stand,	1
not	1
of	1
works,	1
but	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth;)	1
9:12	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Jacob	1
have	1
I	1
loved,	1
but	1
Esau	1
have	1
I	1
hated.	1
	1
9:14	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
there	1
unrighteousness	1
with	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
willeth,	1
nor	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
runneth,	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Even	1
for	1
this	1
same	1
purpose	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
he	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
he	1
hardeneth.	1
	1
9:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then	1
unto	1
me,	1
Why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
find	1
fault?	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
resisted	1
his	1
will?	1
	1
9:20	1
Nay	1
but,	1
O	1
man,	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
repliest	1
against	1
God?	1
Shall	1
the	1
thing	1
formed	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
formed	1
it,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
me	1
thus?	1
	1
9:21	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
potter	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
clay,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
lump	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
and	1
another	1
unto	1
dishonour?	1
	1
9:22	1
What	1
if	1
God,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
power	1
known,	1
endured	1
with	1
much	1
longsuffering	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
wrath	1
fitted	1
to	1
destruction:	1
9:23	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
on	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
mercy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
afore	1
prepared	1
unto	1
glory,	1
9:24	1
Even	1
us,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
called,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
9:25	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
Osee,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
them	1
my	1
people,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
her	1
beloved,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
beloved.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
9:27	1
Esaias	1
also	1
crieth	1
concerning	1
Israel,	1
Though	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
a	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
9:28	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
finish	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
short	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
because	1
a	1
short	1
work	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
Esaias	1
said	1
before,	1
Except	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Sabaoth	1
had	1
left	1
us	1
a	1
seed,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
Sodoma,	1
and	1
been	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
Gomorrha.	1
	1
9:30	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
followed	1
not	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
attained	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
Israel,	1
which	1
followed	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
hath	1
not	1
attained	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
9:32	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
they	1
sought	1
it	1
not	1
by	1
faith,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
For	1
they	1
stumbled	1
at	1
that	1
stumblingstone;	1
9:33	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
stumblingstone	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
offence:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:1	1
Brethren,	1
my	1
heart's	1
desire	1
and	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
Israel	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
them	1
record	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
zeal	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
they	1
being	1
ignorant	1
of	1
God's	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
going	1
about	1
to	1
establish	1
their	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
not	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
righteousness	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
10:5	1
For	1
Moses	1
describeth	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
doeth	1
those	1
things	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith	1
speaketh	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
Say	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
Christ	1
down	1
from	1
above:)	1
10:7	1
Or,	1
Who	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
deep?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
Christ	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.)	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
it?	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
nigh	1
thee,	1
even	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
heart:	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
faith,	1
which	1
we	1
preach;	1
10:9	1
That	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
confess	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shalt	1
believe	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
heart	1
man	1
believeth	1
unto	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mouth	1
confession	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:11	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
the	1
Greek:	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
Lord	1
over	1
all	1
is	1
rich	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:14	1
How	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
believed?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
hear	1
without	1
a	1
preacher?	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
preach,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
sent?	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
How	1
beautiful	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
bring	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
things!	1
	1
10:16	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
obeyed	1
the	1
gospel.	1
For	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
	1
10:17	1
So	1
then	1
faith	1
cometh	1
by	1
hearing,	1
and	1
hearing	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:18	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
heard?	1
Yes	1
verily,	1
their	1
sound	1
went	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Did	1
not	1
Israel	1
know?	1
First	1
Moses	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
provoke	1
you	1
to	1
jealousy	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
people,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
foolish	1
nation	1
I	1
will	1
anger	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
Esaias	1
is	1
very	1
bold,	1
and	1
saith,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not;	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
to	1
Israel	1
he	1
saith,	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
forth	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
a	1
disobedient	1
and	1
gainsaying	1
people.	1
	1
11:1	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Hath	1
God	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
11:2	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people	1
which	1
he	1
foreknew.	1
Wot	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
of	1
Elias?	1
how	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
to	1
God	1
against	1
Israel	1
saying,	1
11:3	1
Lord,	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
digged	1
down	1
thine	1
altars;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
to	1
myself	1
seven	1
thousand	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:5	1
Even	1
so	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
also	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remnant	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
grace.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
if	1
by	1
grace,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
works:	1
otherwise	1
grace	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
works,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace:	1
otherwise	1
work	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
work.	1
	1
11:7	1
What	1
then?	1
Israel	1
hath	1
not	1
obtained	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeketh	1
for;	1
but	1
the	1
election	1
hath	1
obtained	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
blinded.	1
	1
11:8	1
(According	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
slumber,	1
eyes	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
ears	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear;)	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
David	1
saith,	1
Let	1
their	1
table	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
a	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
unto	1
them:	1
11:10	1
Let	1
their	1
eyes	1
be	1
darkened,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
their	1
back	1
alway.	1
	1
11:11	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Have	1
they	1
stumbled	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
but	1
rather	1
through	1
their	1
fall	1
salvation	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
for	1
to	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
	1
11:12	1
Now	1
if	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
diminishing	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
their	1
fulness?	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
I	1
magnify	1
mine	1
office:	1
11:14	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
may	1
provoke	1
to	1
emulation	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
might	1
save	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
casting	1
away	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
reconciling	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
them	1
be,	1
but	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
11:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
firstfruit	1
be	1
holy,	1
the	1
lump	1
is	1
also	1
holy:	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
root	1
be	1
holy,	1
so	1
are	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
be	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
wild	1
olive	1
tree,	1
wert	1
graffed	1
in	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
partakest	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree;	1
11:18	1
Boast	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
branches.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
boast,	1
thou	1
bearest	1
not	1
the	1
root,	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
thee.	1
	1
11:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then,	1
The	1
branches	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
graffed	1
in.	1
	1
11:20	1
Well;	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou	1
standest	1
by	1
faith.	1
Be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
but	1
fear:	1
11:21	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
also	1
spare	1
not	1
thee.	1
	1
11:22	1
Behold	1
therefore	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
severity	1
of	1
God:	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
fell,	1
severity;	1
but	1
toward	1
thee,	1
goodness,	1
if	1
thou	1
continue	1
in	1
his	1
goodness:	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
they	1
also,	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
not	1
still	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
shall	1
be	1
graffed	1
in:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
graff	1
them	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
wild	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
wert	1
graffed	1
contrary	1
to	1
nature	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
olive	1
tree:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
these,	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
be	1
graffed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
olive	1
tree?	1
	1
11:25	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
mystery,	1
lest	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits;	1
that	1
blindness	1
in	1
part	1
is	1
happened	1
to	1
Israel,	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
so	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Sion	1
the	1
Deliverer,	1
and	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
ungodliness	1
from	1
Jacob:	1
11:27	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
unto	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
11:28	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
gospel,	1
they	1
are	1
enemies	1
for	1
your	1
sakes:	1
but	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
election,	1
they	1
are	1
beloved	1
for	1
the	1
father's	1
sakes.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
the	1
gifts	1
and	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
without	1
repentance.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
have	1
not	1
believed	1
God,	1
yet	1
have	1
now	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
through	1
their	1
unbelief:	1
11:31	1
Even	1
so	1
have	1
these	1
also	1
now	1
not	1
believed,	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
mercy	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
11:32	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
concluded	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
all.	1
	1
11:33	1
O	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
riches	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
how	1
unsearchable	1
are	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
past	1
finding	1
out!	1
	1
11:34	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
his	1
counsellor?	1
	1
11:35	1
Or	1
who	1
hath	1
first	1
given	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
him	1
again?	1
	1
11:36	1
For	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
are	1
all	1
things:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
12:1	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
present	1
your	1
bodies	1
a	1
living	1
sacrifice,	1
holy,	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
reasonable	1
service.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
conformed	1
to	1
this	1
world:	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
transformed	1
by	1
the	1
renewing	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prove	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
good,	1
and	1
acceptable,	1
and	1
perfect,	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
I	1
say,	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
himself	1
more	1
highly	1
than	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
soberly,	1
according	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
12:4	1
For	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
members	1
in	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
members	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
office:	1
12:5	1
So	1
we,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
then	1
gifts	1
differing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
us,	1
whether	1
prophecy,	1
let	1
us	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
faith;	1
12:7	1
Or	1
ministry,	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
on	1
our	1
ministering:	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
teacheth,	1
on	1
teaching;	1
12:8	1
Or	1
he	1
that	1
exhorteth,	1
on	1
exhortation:	1
he	1
that	1
giveth,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
simplicity;	1
he	1
that	1
ruleth,	1
with	1
diligence;	1
he	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy,	1
with	1
cheerfulness.	1
	1
12:9	1
Let	1
love	1
be	1
without	1
dissimulation.	1
Abhor	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil;	1
cleave	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
12:10	1
Be	1
kindly	1
affectioned	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
brotherly	1
love;	1
in	1
honour	1
preferring	1
one	1
another;	1
12:11	1
Not	1
slothful	1
in	1
business;	1
fervent	1
in	1
spirit;	1
serving	1
the	1
Lord;	1
12:12	1
Rejoicing	1
in	1
hope;	1
patient	1
in	1
tribulation;	1
continuing	1
instant	1
in	1
prayer;	1
12:13	1
Distributing	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saints;	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality.	1
	1
12:14	1
Bless	1
them	1
which	1
persecute	1
you:	1
bless,	1
and	1
curse	1
not.	1
	1
12:15	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
weep	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
weep.	1
	1
12:16	1
Be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
one	1
toward	1
another.	1
Mind	1
not	1
high	1
things,	1
but	1
condescend	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
estate.	1
Be	1
not	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits.	1
	1
12:17	1
Recompense	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
evil	1
for	1
evil.	1
Provide	1
things	1
honest	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:18	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
lieth	1
in	1
you,	1
live	1
peaceably	1
with	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:19	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
avenge	1
not	1
yourselves,	1
but	1
rather	1
give	1
place	1
unto	1
wrath:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
mine;	1
I	1
will	1
repay,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:20	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thine	1
enemy	1
hunger,	1
feed	1
him;	1
if	1
he	1
thirst,	1
give	1
him	1
drink:	1
for	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heap	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
12:21	1
Be	1
not	1
overcome	1
of	1
evil,	1
but	1
overcome	1
evil	1
with	1
good.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
every	1
soul	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
the	1
higher	1
powers.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
but	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
be	1
are	1
ordained	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:2	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
resisteth	1
the	1
power,	1
resisteth	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
resist	1
shall	1
receive	1
to	1
themselves	1
damnation.	1
	1
13:3	1
For	1
rulers	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
good	1
works,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
power?	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
13:4	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
good.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
be	1
afraid;	1
for	1
he	1
beareth	1
not	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
a	1
revenger	1
to	1
execute	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil.	1
	1
13:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
subject,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
wrath,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
13:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
pay	1
ye	1
tribute	1
also:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
God's	1
ministers,	1
attending	1
continually	1
upon	1
this	1
very	1
thing.	1
	1
13:7	1
Render	1
therefore	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
dues:	1
tribute	1
to	1
whom	1
tribute	1
is	1
due;	1
custom	1
to	1
whom	1
custom;	1
fear	1
to	1
whom	1
fear;	1
honour	1
to	1
whom	1
honour.	1
	1
13:8	1
Owe	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
thing,	1
but	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
another	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
commandment,	1
it	1
is	1
briefly	1
comprehended	1
in	1
this	1
saying,	1
namely,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
13:10	1
Love	1
worketh	1
no	1
ill	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
therefore	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
that,	1
knowing	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
awake	1
out	1
of	1
sleep:	1
for	1
now	1
is	1
our	1
salvation	1
nearer	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
believed.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
night	1
is	1
far	1
spent,	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
let	1
us	1
therefore	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
walk	1
honestly,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day;	1
not	1
in	1
rioting	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
not	1
in	1
chambering	1
and	1
wantonness,	1
not	1
in	1
strife	1
and	1
envying.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
put	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
not	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
14:1	1
Him	1
that	1
is	1
weak	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
receive	1
ye,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
doubtful	1
disputations.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
one	1
believeth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
all	1
things:	1
another,	1
who	1
is	1
weak,	1
eateth	1
herbs.	1
	1
14:3	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
despise	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
not;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
him	1
which	1
eateth	1
not	1
judge	1
him	1
that	1
eateth:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
14:4	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another	1
man's	1
servant?	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
he	1
standeth	1
or	1
falleth.	1
Yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holden	1
up:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
stand.	1
	1
14:5	1
One	1
man	1
esteemeth	1
one	1
day	1
above	1
another:	1
another	1
esteemeth	1
every	1
day	1
alike.	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
that	1
regardeth	1
the	1
day,	1
regardeth	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
day,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
regard	1
it.	1
He	1
that	1
eateth,	1
eateth	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
not,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
eateth	1
not,	1
and	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
liveth	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
dieth	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
live,	1
we	1
live	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whether	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
die	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
whether	1
we	1
live	1
therefore,	1
or	1
die,	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
Lord's.	1
	1
14:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
Christ	1
both	1
died,	1
and	1
rose,	1
and	1
revived,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
Lord	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
living.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
brother?	1
or	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
thy	1
brother?	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
confess	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:12	1
So	1
then	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:13	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
therefore	1
judge	1
one	1
another	1
any	1
more:	1
but	1
judge	1
this	1
rather,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
or	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
his	1
brother's	1
way.	1
	1
14:14	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
unclean	1
of	1
itself:	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
esteemeth	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
unclean,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
14:15	1
But	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
grieved	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
now	1
walkest	1
thou	1
not	1
charitably.	1
Destroy	1
not	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died.	1
	1
14:16	1
Let	1
not	1
then	1
your	1
good	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of:	1
14:17	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
meat	1
and	1
drink;	1
but	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:18	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
serveth	1
Christ	1
is	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
approved	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:19	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
make	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
things	1
wherewith	1
one	1
may	1
edify	1
another.	1
	1
14:20	1
For	1
meat	1
destroy	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God.	1
All	1
things	1
indeed	1
are	1
pure;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evil	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
who	1
eateth	1
with	1
offence.	1
	1
14:21	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
neither	1
to	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
whereby	1
thy	1
brother	1
stumbleth,	1
or	1
is	1
offended,	1
or	1
is	1
made	1
weak.	1
	1
14:22	1
Hast	1
thou	1
faith?	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
thyself	1
before	1
God.	1
Happy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth	1
not	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
alloweth.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
doubteth	1
is	1
damned	1
if	1
he	1
eat,	1
because	1
he	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
15:1	1
We	1
then	1
that	1
are	1
strong	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
infirmities	1
of	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
please	1
ourselves.	1
	1
15:2	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
please	1
his	1
neighbour	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
to	1
edification.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
pleased	1
not	1
himself;	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
reproaches	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
reproached	1
thee	1
fell	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
aforetime	1
were	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
learning,	1
that	1
we	1
through	1
patience	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures	1
might	1
have	1
hope.	1
	1
15:5	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
consolation	1
grant	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
likeminded	1
one	1
toward	1
another	1
according	1
to	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
15:6	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
and	1
one	1
mouth	1
glorify	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:7	1
Wherefore	1
receive	1
ye	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
received	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:8	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
a	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
promises	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers:	1
15:9	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
mercy;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
sing	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith,	1
Rejoice,	1
ye	1
Gentiles,	1
with	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
again,	1
Praise	1
the	1
Lord,	1
all	1
ye	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
laud	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
again,	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
15:13	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hope	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
believing,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
hope,	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
persuaded	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
goodness,	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
admonish	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:15	1
Nevertheless,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
as	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
mind,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
God,	1
15:16	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
ministering	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
offering	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
be	1
acceptable,	1
being	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
whereof	1
I	1
may	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
pertain	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
15:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Christ	1
hath	1
not	1
wrought	1
by	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
obedient,	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
15:19	1
Through	1
mighty	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God;	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Illyricum,	1
I	1
have	1
fully	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:20	1
Yea,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
strived	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
not	1
where	1
Christ	1
was	1
named,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
upon	1
another	1
man's	1
foundation:	1
15:21	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
spoken	1
of,	1
they	1
shall	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
hindered	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
now	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
place	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
15:24	1
Whensoever	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
journey	1
into	1
Spain,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
thitherward	1
by	1
you,	1
if	1
first	1
I	1
be	1
somewhat	1
filled	1
with	1
your	1
company.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
15:26	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
certain	1
contribution	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:27	1
It	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
verily;	1
and	1
their	1
debtors	1
they	1
are.	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
their	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
their	1
duty	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
carnal	1
things.	1
	1
15:28	1
When	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
this,	1
and	1
have	1
sealed	1
to	1
them	1
this	1
fruit,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Spain.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:30	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
strive	1
together	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
prayers	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
me;	1
15:31	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1

the	1
saints;	1
15:32	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
joy	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
may	1
with	1
you	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
15:33	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:1	1
I	1
commend	1
unto	1
you	1
Phebe	1
our	1

is	1
a	1

which	1
is	1

16:2	1
That	1

and	1
that	1
ye	1
assist	1
her	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
business	1
she	1

you:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
succourer	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
of	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
16:3	1
Greet	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila	1
my	1

Jesus:	1

Who	1

for	1
my	1
life	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
own	1
necks:	1
unto	1
whom	1
not	1
only	1
I	1
give	1
thanks,	1
but	1

the	1
churches	1

	1

much	1
labour	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
16:7	1
Salute	1

and	1
Junia,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
and	1
my	1
fellow-prisoners,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
note	1
among	1
the	1
apostles,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
Christ	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
16:8	1
Greet	1
Amplias	1
my	1
beloved	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:9	1
Salute	1
Urbane,	1
our	1

and	1
Stachys	1
my	1

	1
16:11	1
Salute	1

all	1
the	1

them.	1
	1
16:16	1
Salute	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Christ	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:17	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
cause	1
divisions	1
and	1
offences	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
learned;	1
and	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
serve	1
not	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
belly;	1
and	1
by	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
fair	1
speeches	1
deceive	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
16:19	1
For	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
come	1
abroad	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
behalf:	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
wise	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
simple	1
concerning	1
evil.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
bruise	1
Satan	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
shortly.	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:21	1
Timotheus	1
my	1
workfellow,	1
and	1
Lucius,	1
and	1
Jason,	1
and	1
Sosipater,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:22	1
I	1
Tertius,	1
who	1
wrote	1
this	1
epistle,	1
salute	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:23	1
Gaius	1
mine	1
host,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
saluteth	1
you.	1
Erastus	1
the	1
chamberlain	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Quartus	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
16:24	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:25	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
stablish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
was	1
kept	1
secret	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
16:26	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
faith:	1
16:27	1
To	1
God	1
only	1
wise,	1
be	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1

	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
through	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Sosthenes	1
our	1
brother,	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
both	1
their's	1
and	1
our's:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
behalf,	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:5	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
ye	1
are	1
enriched	1
by	1
him,	1
in	1
all	1
utterance,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Christ	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
you:	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
behind	1
in	1
no	1
gift;	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Who	1
shall	1
also	1
confirm	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
speak	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
perfectly	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
judgment.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
declared	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
by	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Chloe,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
contentions	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
1:12	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Cephas;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
Is	1
Christ	1
divided?	1
was	1
Paul	1
crucified	1
for	1
you?	1
or	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Paul?	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
baptized	1
none	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
Crispus	1
and	1
Gaius;	1
1:15	1
Lest	1
any	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
baptized	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
name.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
baptized	1
also	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Stephanas:	1
besides,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
I	1
baptized	1
any	1
other.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
Christ	1
sent	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
baptize,	1
but	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel:	1
not	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
words,	1
lest	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
perish	1
foolishness;	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
nothing	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
prudent.	1
	1
1:20	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
wise?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
disputer	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
hath	1
not	1
God	1
made	1
foolish	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
after	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
wisdom	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
it	1
pleased	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
preaching	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
1:22	1
For	1
the	1
Jews	1
require	1
a	1
sign,	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks	1
seek	1
after	1
wisdom:	1
1:23	1
But	1
we	1
preach	1
Christ	1
crucified,	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Greeks	1
foolishness;	1
1:24	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
called,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks,	1
Christ	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
Because	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
wiser	1
than	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
ye	1
see	1
your	1
calling,	1
brethren,	1
how	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
wise	1
men	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
not	1
many	1
mighty,	1
not	1
many	1
noble,	1
are	1
called:	1
1:27	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
wise;	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
weak	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
mighty;	1
1:28	1
And	1
base	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
despised,	1
hath	1
God	1
chosen,	1
yea,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
nought	1
things	1
that	1
are:	1
1:29	1
That	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
us	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sanctification,	1
and	1
redemption:	1
1:31	1
That,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
came	1
not	1
with	1
excellency	1
of	1
speech	1
or	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
declaring	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
I	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
among	1
you,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
him	1
crucified.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
weakness,	1
and	1
in	1
fear,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
my	1
speech	1
and	1
my	1
preaching	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
enticing	1
words	1
of	1
man's	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
in	1
demonstration	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
of	1
power:	1
2:5	1
That	1
your	1
faith	1
should	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:6	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
speak	1
wisdom	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
perfect:	1
yet	1
not	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
speak	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
mystery,	1
even	1
the	1
hidden	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
God	1
ordained	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
our	1
glory:	1
2:8	1
Which	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
knew:	1
for	1
had	1
they	1
known	1
it,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Eye	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
nor	1
ear	1
heard,	1
neither	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
searcheth	1
all	1
things,	1
yea,	1
the	1
deep	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
what	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
save	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him?	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
we	1
have	1
received,	1
not	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
freely	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:13	1
Which	1
things	1
also	1
we	1
speak,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
teacheth,	1
but	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
teacheth;	1
comparing	1
spiritual	1
things	1
with	1
spiritual.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
receiveth	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
foolishness	1
unto	1
him:	1
neither	1
can	1
he	1
know	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
spiritually	1
discerned.	1
	1
2:15	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
spiritual	1
judgeth	1
all	1
things,	1
yet	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
instruct	1
him?	1
	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
as	1
unto	1
carnal,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
babes	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:2	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
meat:	1
for	1
hitherto	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it,	1
neither	1
yet	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
able.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
carnal:	1
for	1
whereas	1
there	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
envying,	1
and	1
strife,	1
and	1
divisions,	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal,	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
men?	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
while	1
one	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
another,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal?	1
	1
3:5	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
Paul,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Apollos,	1
but	1
ministers	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
believed,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
to	1
every	1
man?	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
planted,	1
Apollos	1
watered;	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:7	1
So	1
then	1
neither	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
any	1
thing,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
watereth;	1
but	1
God	1
that	1
giveth	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watereth	1
are	1
one:	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
his	1
own	1
reward	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
labour.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
labourers	1
together	1
with	1
God:	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
husbandry,	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
building.	1
	1
3:10	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
wise	1
masterbuilder,	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
another	1
buildeth	1
thereon.	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
take	1
heed	1
how	1
he	1
buildeth	1
thereupon.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
other	1
foundation	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
lay	1
than	1
that	1
is	1
laid,	1
which	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
build	1
upon	1
this	1
foundation	1
gold,	1
silver,	1
precious	1
stones,	1
wood,	1
hay,	1
stubble;	1
3:13	1
Every	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
by	1
fire;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
try	1
every	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
3:14	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
abide	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
thereupon,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
reward.	1
	1
3:15	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
burned,	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
loss:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
yet	1
so	1
as	1
by	1
fire.	1
	1
3:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you?	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
defile	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
him	1
shall	1
God	1
destroy;	1
for	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
holy,	1
which	1
temple	1
ye	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
himself.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
let	1
him	1
become	1
a	1
fool,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
wise.	1
	1
3:19	1
For	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
foolishness	1
with	1
God.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
taketh	1
the	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
craftiness.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
3:21	1
Therefore	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
men.	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:22	1
Whether	1
Paul,	1
or	1
Apollos,	1
or	1
Cephas,	1
or	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
life,	1
or	1
death,	1
or	1
things	1
present,	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
all	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:23	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
Christ's;	1
and	1
Christ	1
is	1
God's.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
account	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:2	1
Moreover	1
it	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
stewards,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
faithful.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
you,	1
or	1
of	1
man's	1
judgment:	1
yea,	1
I	1
judge	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
self.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
by	1
myself;	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
hereby	1
justified:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
judgeth	1
me	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
judge	1
nothing	1
before	1
the	1
time,	1
until	1
the	1
Lord	1
come,	1
who	1
both	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
manifest	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
hearts:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
these	1
things,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
figure	1
transferred	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
Apollos	1
for	1
your	1
sakes;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
learn	1
in	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
men	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
puffed	1
up	1
for	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
who	1
maketh	1
thee	1
to	1
differ	1
from	1
another?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
receive?	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
didst	1
receive	1
it,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
glory,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
received	1
it?	1
	1
4:8	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
full,	1
now	1
ye	1
are	1
rich,	1
ye	1
have	1
reigned	1
as	1
kings	1
without	1
us:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
did	1
reign,	1
that	1
we	1
also	1
might	1
reign	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:9	1
For	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
last,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
a	1
spectacle	1
unto	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to	1
angels,	1
and	1
to	1
men.	1
	1
4:10	1
We	1
are	1
fools	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
Christ;	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
strong;	1
ye	1
are	1
honourable,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
despised.	1
	1
4:11	1
Even	1
unto	1
this	1
present	1
hour	1
we	1
both	1
hunger,	1
and	1
thirst,	1
and	1
are	1
naked,	1
and	1
are	1
buffeted,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
dwellingplace;	1
4:12	1
And	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands:	1
being	1
reviled,	1
we	1
bless;	1
being	1
persecuted,	1
we	1
suffer	1
it:	1
4:13	1
Being	1
defamed,	1
we	1
intreat:	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
as	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
offscouring	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
write	1
not	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
shame	1
you,	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
beloved	1
sons	1
I	1
warn	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
though	1
ye	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
instructers	1
in	1
Christ,	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
many	1
fathers:	1
for	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
4:16	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
Timotheus,	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
son,	1
and	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
remembrance	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
as	1
I	1
teach	1
every	1
where	1
in	1
every	1
church.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
some	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
shortly,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
and	1
will	1
know,	1
not	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
but	1
in	1
power.	1
	1
4:21	1
What	1
will	1
ye?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
or	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness?	1
	1
5:1	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
commonly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
fornication	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
such	1
fornication	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
named	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
his	1
father's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
rather	1
mourned,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
deed	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
verily,	1
as	1
absent	1
in	1
body,	1
but	1
present	1
in	1
spirit,	1
have	1
judged	1
already,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
so	1
done	1
this	1
deed,	1
5:4	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit,	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:5	1
To	1
deliver	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
unto	1
Satan	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
may	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:6	1
Your	1
glorying	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump?	1
	1
5:7	1
Purge	1
out	1
therefore	1
the	1
old	1
leaven,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
lump,	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
unleavened.	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
our	1
passover	1
is	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
us:	1
5:8	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
with	1
old	1
leaven,	1
neither	1
with	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
wickedness;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
of	1
sincerity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
5:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
epistle	1
not	1
to	1
company	1
with	1
fornicators:	1
5:10	1
Yet	1
not	1
altogether	1
with	1
the	1
fornicators	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
covetous,	1
or	1
extortioners,	1
or	1
with	1
idolaters;	1
for	1
then	1
must	1
ye	1
needs	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
brother	1
be	1
a	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
covetous,	1
or	1
an	1
idolater,	1
or	1
a	1
railer,	1
or	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
or	1
an	1
extortioner;	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
no	1
not	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
without?	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
judge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
within?	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
God	1
judgeth.	1
Therefore	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves	1
that	1
wicked	1
person.	1
	1
6:1	1
Dare	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
another,	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
before	1
the	1
unjust,	1
and	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
saints?	1
	1
6:2	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
you,	1
are	1
ye	1
unworthy	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
smallest	1
matters?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
judge	1
angels?	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
this	1
life?	1
6:4	1
If	1
then	1
ye	1
have	1
judgments	1
of	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
this	1
life,	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
judge	1
who	1
are	1
least	1
esteemed	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
6:5	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
Is	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
among	1
you?	1
no,	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
between	1
his	1
brethren?	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
brother	1
goeth	1
to	1
law	1
with	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
utterly	1
a	1
fault	1
among	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
take	1
wrong?	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
defrauded?	1
	1
6:8	1
Nay,	1
ye	1
do	1
wrong,	1
and	1
defraud,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
brethren.	1
	1
6:9	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
neither	1
fornicators,	1
nor	1
idolaters,	1
nor	1
adulterers,	1
nor	1
effeminate,	1
nor	1
abusers	1
of	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
6:10	1
Nor	1
thieves,	1
nor	1
covetous,	1
nor	1
drunkards,	1
nor	1
revilers,	1
nor	1
extortioners,	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
such	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
washed,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
sanctified,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
under	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any.	1
	1
6:13	1
Meats	1
for	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
the	1
belly	1
for	1
meats:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
destroy	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
them.	1
Now	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
fornication,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
both	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
will	1
also	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
6:15	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
bodies	1
are	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
an	1
harlot?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
an	1
harlot	1
is	1
one	1
body?	1
	1
for	1
two,	1
saith	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
one	1
spirit.	1
	1
6:18	1
Flee	1
fornication.	1
Every	1
sin	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
fornication	1
sinneth	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
6:19	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price:	1
therefore	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
spirit,	1
which	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
wrote	1
unto	1
me:	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
7:2	1
Nevertheless,	1
to	1
avoid	1
fornication,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
woman	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
Let	1
the	1
husband	1
render	1
unto	1
the	1
wife	1
due	1
benevolence:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
husband.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
wife	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
husband:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
husband	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
wife.	1
	1
7:5	1
Defraud	1
ye	1
not	1
one	1
the	1
other,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
consent	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
give	1
yourselves	1
to	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer;	1
and	1
come	1
together	1
again,	1
that	1
Satan	1
tempt	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
incontinency.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
by	1
permission,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
commandment.	1
	1
7:7	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
myself.	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
his	1
proper	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
one	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
say	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
unmarried	1
and	1
widows,	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
even	1
as	1
I.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
contain,	1
let	1
them	1
marry:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
marry	1
than	1
to	1
burn.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
married	1
I	1
command,	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wife	1
depart	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
7:11	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
depart,	1
let	1
her	1
remain	1
unmarried	1
or	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
husband	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
speak	1
I,	1
not	1
the	1
Lord:	1
If	1
any	1
brother	1
hath	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
her,	1
let	1
her	1
not	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
husband	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
wife	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
husband:	1
else	1
were	1
your	1
children	1
unclean;	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
holy.	1
	1
7:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
depart,	1
let	1
him	1
depart.	1
A	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
sister	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
bondage	1
in	1
such	1
cases:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
peace.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
what	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
wife,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
husband?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
man,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
every	1
man,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
called	1
every	1
one,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
walk.	1
And	1
so	1
ordain	1
I	1
in	1
all	1
churches.	1
	1
7:18	1
Is	1
any	1
man	1
called	1
being	1
circumcised?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
become	1
uncircumcised.	1
Is	1
any	1
called	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
7:19	1
Circumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
but	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
calling	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
called.	1
	1
7:21	1
Art	1
thou	1
called	1
being	1
a	1
servant?	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
made	1
free,	1
use	1
it	1
rather.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
being	1
a	1
servant,	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
freeman:	1
likewise	1
also	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called,	1
being	1
free,	1
is	1
Christ's	1
servant.	1
	1
7:23	1
Ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price;	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:24	1
Brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man,	1
wherein	1
he	1
is	1
called,	1
therein	1
abide	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
Now	1
concerning	1
virgins	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
judgment,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
be	1
faithful.	1
	1
7:26	1
I	1
suppose	1
therefore	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
distress,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
7:27	1
Art	1
thou	1
bound	1
unto	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
loosed.	1
Art	1
thou	1
loosed	1
from	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
wife.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
marry,	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sinned;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
virgin	1
marry,	1
she	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned.	1
Nevertheless	1
such	1
shall	1
have	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
but	1
I	1
spare	1
you.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
short:	1
it	1
remaineth,	1
that	1
both	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
wives	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
none;	1
7:30	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
weep,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
wept	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
rejoice,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
buy,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
possessed	1
not;	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
use	1
this	1
world,	1
as	1
not	1
abusing	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
passeth	1
away.	1
	1
7:32	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
without	1
carefulness.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
Lord:	1
7:33	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:34	1
There	1
is	1
difference	1
also	1
between	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
virgin.	1
The	1
unmarried	1
woman	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
holy	1
both	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
spirit:	1
but	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
she	1
may	1
please	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
profit;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
you,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
comely,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
attend	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
without	1
distraction.	1
	1
7:36	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
behaveth	1
himself	1
uncomely	1
toward	1
his	1
virgin,	1
if	1
she	1
pass	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
her	1
age,	1
and	1
need	1
so	1
require,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
he	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
let	1
them	1
marry.	1
	1
7:37	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
that	1
standeth	1
stedfast	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
having	1
no	1
necessity,	1
but	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
hath	1
so	1
decreed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
virgin,	1
doeth	1
well.	1
	1
7:38	1
So	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
well;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
not	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
better.	1
	1
7:39	1
The	1
wife	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
will;	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:40	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
happier	1
if	1
she	1
so	1
abide,	1
after	1
my	1
judgment:	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
as	1
touching	1
things	1
offered	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
knowledge.	1
Knowledge	1
puffeth	1
up,	1
but	1
charity	1
edifieth.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
knoweth	1
any	1
thing,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
nothing	1
yet	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
know.	1
	1
8:3	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
As	1
concerning	1
therefore	1
the	1
eating	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
idol	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
God	1
but	1
one.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
though	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
gods,	1
whether	1
in	1
heaven	1
or	1
in	1
earth,	1
(as	1
there	1
be	1
gods	1
many,	1
and	1
lords	1
many,)	1
8:6	1
But	1
to	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
God,	1
the	1
Father,	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
one	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
knowledge:	1
for	1
some	1
with	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
idol	1
unto	1
this	1
hour	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
offered	1
unto	1
an	1
idol;	1
and	1
their	1
conscience	1
being	1
weak	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
8:8	1
But	1
meat	1
commendeth	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
for	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
better;	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat	1
not,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
this	1
liberty	1
of	1
your's	1
become	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weak.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
thee	1
which	1
hast	1
knowledge	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
idol's	1
temple,	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
weak	1
be	1
emboldened	1
to	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
to	1
idols;	1
8:11	1
And	1
through	1
thy	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
weak	1
brother	1
perish,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died?	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
sin	1
so	1
against	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wound	1
their	1
weak	1
conscience,	1
ye	1
sin	1
against	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:13	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
meat	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend,	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
no	1
flesh	1
while	1
the	1
world	1
standeth,	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend.	1
	1
9:1	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
an	1
apostle?	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord?	1
are	1
not	1
ye	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
9:2	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
an	1
apostle	1
unto	1
others,	1
yet	1
doubtless	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
mine	1
apostleship	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:3	1
Mine	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
examine	1
me	1
is	1
this,	1
9:4	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink?	1
	1
9:5	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
lead	1
about	1
a	1
sister,	1
a	1
wife,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
other	1
apostles,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
Cephas?	1
	1
9:6	1
Or	1
I	1
only	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
have	1
not	1
we	1
power	1
to	1
forbear	1
working?	1
	1
9:7	1
Who	1
goeth	1
a	1
warfare	1
any	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
charges?	1
who	1
planteth	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof?	1
or	1
who	1
feedeth	1
a	1
flock,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
flock?	1
	1
9:8	1
Say	1
I	1
these	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
man?	1
or	1
saith	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
the	1
same	1
also?	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
Doth	1
God	1
take	1
care	1
for	1
oxen?	1
	1
9:10	1
Or	1
saith	1
he	1
it	1
altogether	1
for	1
our	1
sakes?	1
For	1
our	1
sakes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
this	1
is	1
written:	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
ploweth	1
should	1
plow	1
in	1
hope;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
thresheth	1
in	1
hope	1
should	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
hope.	1
	1
9:11	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
sown	1
unto	1
you	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
reap	1
your	1
carnal	1
things?	1
	1
9:12	1
If	1
others	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
over	1
you,	1
are	1
not	1
we	1
rather?	1
	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
used	1
this	1
power;	1
but	1
suffer	1
all	1
things,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
hinder	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:13	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
minister	1
about	1
holy	1
things	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
temple?	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
are	1
partakers	1
with	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
9:14	1
Even	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
ordained	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
should	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die,	1
than	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
make	1
my	1
glorying	1
void.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
glory	1
of:	1
for	1
necessity	1
is	1
laid	1
upon	1
me;	1
yea,	1
woe	1
is	1
unto	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
preach	1
not	1
the	1
gospel!	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
willingly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
reward:	1
but	1
if	1
against	1
my	1
will,	1
a	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:18	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
then?	1
Verily	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
without	1
charge,	1
that	1
I	1
abuse	1
not	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
men,	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
servant	1
unto	1
all,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
Jew,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
Jews;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law;	1
9:21	1
To	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law,	1
as	1
without	1
law,	1
(being	1
not	1
without	1
law	1
to	1
God,	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
Christ,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law.	1
	1
9:22	1
To	1
the	1
weak	1
became	1
I	1
as	1
weak,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
weak:	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
save	1
some.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
gospel's	1
sake,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
partaker	1
thereof	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:24	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
race	1
run	1
all,	1
but	1
one	1
receiveth	1
the	1
prize?	1
So	1
run,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
obtain.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
striveth	1
for	1
the	1
mastery	1
is	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
Now	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
corruptible	1
crown;	1
but	1
we	1
an	1
incorruptible.	1
	1
9:26	1
I	1
therefore	1
so	1
run,	1
not	1
as	1
uncertainly;	1
so	1
fight	1
I,	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
beateth	1
the	1
air:	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
keep	1
under	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
subjection:	1
lest	1
that	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
others,	1
I	1
myself	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
castaway.	1
	1
10:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
how	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
fathers	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
all	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:2	1
And	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:3	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
meat;	1
10:4	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
drink	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
drink:	1
for	1
they	1
drank	1
of	1
that	1
spiritual	1
Rock	1
that	1
followed	1
them:	1
and	1
that	1
Rock	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
10:5	1
But	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
God	1
was	1
not	1
well	1
pleased:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
overthrown	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
10:6	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
our	1
examples,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
lust	1
after	1
evil	1
things,	1
as	1
they	1
also	1
lusted.	1
	1
10:7	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
idolaters,	1
as	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
them;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
10:8	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
committed,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
	1
10:9	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
tempt	1
Christ,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
tempted,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
serpents.	1
	1
10:10	1
Neither	1
murmur	1
ye,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
murmured,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
destroyer.	1
	1
10:11	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
ensamples:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
admonition,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
thinketh	1
he	1
standeth	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
fall.	1
	1
10:13	1
There	1
hath	1
no	1
temptation	1
taken	1
you	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
common	1
to	1
man:	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
above	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
able;	1
but	1
will	1
with	1
the	1
temptation	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
escape,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:14	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
flee	1
from	1
idolatry.	1
	1
10:15	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
to	1
wise	1
men;	1
judge	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
cup	1
of	1
blessing	1
which	1
we	1
bless,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ?	1
The	1
bread	1
which	1
we	1
break,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ?	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
we	1
being	1
many	1
are	1
one	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
body:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
partakers	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
bread.	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold	1
Israel	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
which	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
10:19	1
What	1
say	1
I	1
then?	1
that	1
the	1
idol	1
is	1
any	1
thing,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
idols	1
is	1
any	1
thing?	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
sacrifice,	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
devils,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
10:21	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
drink	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
devils:	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Lord's	1
table,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
devils.	1
	1
10:22	1
Do	1
we	1
provoke	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
jealousy?	1
are	1
we	1
stronger	1
than	1
he?	1
10:23	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
edify	1
not.	1
	1
10:24	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
seek	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
another's	1
wealth.	1
	1
10:25	1
Whatsoever	1
is	1
sold	1
in	1
the	1
shambles,	1
that	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
10:26	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
10:27	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not	1
bid	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
go;	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
10:28	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
eat	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
that	1
shewed	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof:	1
10:29	1
Conscience,	1
I	1
say,	1
not	1
thine	1
own,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
why	1
is	1
my	1
liberty	1
judged	1
of	1
another	1
man's	1
conscience?	1
	1
10:30	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
grace	1
be	1
a	1
partaker,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
thanks?	1
	1
10:31	1
Whether	1
therefore	1
ye	1
eat,	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Give	1
none	1
offence,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God:	1
10:33	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
not	1
seeking	1
mine	1
own	1
profit,	1
but	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
many,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
I	1
praise	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
ordinances,	1
as	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:4	1
Every	1
man	1
praying	1
or	1
prophesying,	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
dishonoureth	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
11:5	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
prayeth	1
or	1
prophesieth	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
uncovered	1
dishonoureth	1
her	1
head:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
all	1
one	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
shaven.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
covered,	1
let	1
her	1
also	1
be	1
shorn:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
shorn	1
or	1
shaven,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
covered.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
a	1
man	1
indeed	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
head,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:8	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
woman:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:9	1
Neither	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
created	1
for	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
ought	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
11:11	1
Nevertheless	1
neither	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
the	1
woman,	1
neither	1
the	1
woman	1
without	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:13	1
Judge	1
in	1
yourselves:	1
is	1
it	1
comely	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
uncovered?	1
	1
11:14	1
Doth	1
not	1
even	1
nature	1
itself	1
teach	1
you,	1
that,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
glory	1
to	1
her:	1
for	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
covering.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
contentious,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
custom,	1
neither	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:17	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
better,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
partly	1
believe	1
it.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
also	1
heresies	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
approved	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
11:20	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
therefore	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Lord's	1
supper.	1
	1
11:21	1
For	1
in	1
eating	1
every	1
one	1
taketh	1
before	1
other	1
his	1
own	1
supper:	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
another	1
is	1
drunken.	1
	1
11:22	1
What?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
houses	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink	1
in?	1
or	1
despise	1
ye	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shame	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
not?	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you?	1
shall	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
in	1
this?	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
betrayed	1
took	1
bread:	1
11:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body,	1
which	1
is	1
broken	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:25	1
After	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
also	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
supped,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood:	1
this	1
do	1
ye,	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
ye	1
drink	1
it,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:26	1
For	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
ye	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup,	1
ye	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
Lord's	1
death	1
till	1
he	1
come.	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
unworthily,	1
shall	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
let	1
a	1
man	1
examine	1
himself,	1
and	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
of	1
that	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
cup.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
unworthily,	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
himself,	1
not	1
discerning	1
the	1
Lord's	1
body.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
many	1
are	1
weak	1
and	1
sickly	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
many	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:31	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
judge	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
judged.	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
judged,	1
we	1
are	1
chastened	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
condemned	1
with	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:33	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
eat,	1
tarry	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hunger,	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
at	1
home;	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
together	1
unto	1
condemnation.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
I	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant.	1
	1
12:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
Gentiles,	1
carried	1
away	1
unto	1
these	1
dumb	1
idols,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
led.	1
	1
12:3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
speaking	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
calleth	1
Jesus	1
accursed:	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
12:4	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
gifts,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
differences	1
of	1
administrations,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
operations,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
profit	1
withal.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
to	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
knowledge	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:9	1
To	1
another	1
faith	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:10	1
To	1
another	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
miracles;	1
to	1
another	1
prophecy;	1
to	1
another	1
discerning	1
of	1
spirits;	1
to	1
another	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
tongues:	1
12:11	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
worketh	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
selfsame	1
Spirit,	1
dividing	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
severally	1
as	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
many	1
members,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
body,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body:	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
baptized	1
into	1
one	1
body,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
Jews	1
or	1
Gentiles,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free;	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
made	1
to	1
drink	1
into	1
one	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:14	1
For	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
member,	1
but	1
many.	1
	1
12:15	1
If	1
the	1
foot	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
ear	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
eye,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:17	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
were	1
an	1
eye,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
hearing?	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
were	1
hearing,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
smelling?	1
	1
12:18	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
God	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
member,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
many	1
members,	1
yet	1
but	1
one	1
body.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
eye	1
cannot	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
thee:	1
nor	1
again	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
feet,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:22	1
Nay,	1
much	1
more	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
feeble,	1
are	1
necessary:	1
12:23	1
And	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
we	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
honourable,	1
upon	1
these	1
we	1
bestow	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour;	1
and	1
our	1
uncomely	1
parts	1
have	1
more	1
abundant	1
comeliness.	1
	1
12:24	1
For	1
our	1
comely	1
parts	1
have	1
no	1
need:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
tempered	1
the	1
body	1
together,	1
having	1
given	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
which	1
lacked.	1
	1
12:25	1
That	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
schism	1
in	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
whether	1
one	1
member	1
suffer,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
suffer	1
with	1
it;	1
or	1
one	1
member	1
be	1
honoured,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
rejoice	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
members	1
in	1
particular.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
first	1
apostles,	1
secondarily	1
prophets,	1
thirdly	1
teachers,	1
after	1
that	1
miracles,	1
then	1
gifts	1
of	1
healings,	1
helps,	1
governments,	1
diversities	1
of	1
tongues.	1
	1
12:29	1
Are	1
all	1
apostles?	1
are	1
all	1
prophets?	1
are	1
all	1
teachers?	1
are	1
all	1
workers	1
of	1
miracles?	1
	1
12:30	1
Have	1
all	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing?	1
do	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues?	1
do	1
all	1
interpret?	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
covet	1
earnestly	1
the	1
best	1
gifts:	1
and	1
yet	1
shew	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
way.	1
	1
13:1	1
Though	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongues	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
as	1
sounding	1
brass,	1
or	1
a	1
tinkling	1
cymbal.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
understand	1
all	1
mysteries,	1
and	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
faith,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
remove	1
mountains,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
goods	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
it	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:4	1
Charity	1
suffereth	1
long,	1
and	1
is	1
kind;	1
charity	1
envieth	1
not;	1
charity	1
vaunteth	1
not	1
itself,	1
is	1
not	1
puffed	1
up,	1
13:5	1
Doth	1
not	1
behave	1
itself	1
unseemly,	1
seeketh	1
not	1
her	1
own,	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
provoked,	1
thinketh	1
no	1
evil;	1
13:6	1
Rejoiceth	1
not	1
in	1
iniquity,	1
but	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
13:7	1
Beareth	1
all	1
things,	1
believeth	1
all	1
things,	1
hopeth	1
all	1
things,	1
endureth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:8	1
Charity	1
never	1
faileth:	1
but	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
prophecies,	1
they	1
shall	1
fail;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
tongues,	1
they	1
shall	1
cease;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
in	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
prophesy	1
in	1
part.	1
	1
13:10	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
perfect	1
is	1
come,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
away.	1
	1
13:11	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
understood	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
a	1
child:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
childish	1
things.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
glass,	1
darkly;	1
but	1
then	1
face	1
to	1
face:	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
part;	1
but	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
known.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
now	1
abideth	1
faith,	1
hope,	1
charity,	1
these	1
three;	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
charity.	1
	1
14:1	1
Follow	1
after	1
charity,	1
and	1
desire	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prophesy.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
speaketh	1
not	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
understandeth	1
him;	1
howbeit	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
he	1
speaketh	1
mysteries.	1
	1
14:3	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
exhortation,	1
and	1
comfort.	1
	1
14:4	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
edifieth	1
himself;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
edifieth	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
prophesied:	1
for	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
with	1
tongues,	1
except	1
he	1
interpret,	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
may	1
receive	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:6	1
Now,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
speaking	1
with	1
tongues,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
profit	1
you,	1
except	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
either	1
by	1
revelation,	1
or	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
or	1
by	1
prophesying,	1
or	1
by	1
doctrine?	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
even	1
things	1
without	1
life	1
giving	1
sound,	1
whether	1
pipe	1
or	1
harp,	1
except	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
distinction	1
in	1
the	1
sounds,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
piped	1
or	1
harped?	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
trumpet	1
give	1
an	1
uncertain	1
sound,	1
who	1
shall	1
prepare	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
battle?	1
	1
14:9	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
utter	1
by	1
the	1
tongue	1
words	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
spoken?	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
14:10	1
There	1
are,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
so	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
without	1
signification.	1
	1
14:11	1
Therefore	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
voice,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
a	1
barbarian,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
barbarian	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
14:12	1
Even	1
so	1
ye,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
zealous	1
of	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
seek	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
excel	1
to	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:13	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
pray	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
pray	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
my	1
spirit	1
prayeth,	1
but	1
my	1
understanding	1
is	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
14:15	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
then?	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also.	1
	1
14:16	1
Else	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bless	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
occupieth	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
unlearned	1
say	1
Amen	1
at	1
thy	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
seeing	1
he	1
understandeth	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest?	1
	1
14:17	1
For	1
thou	1
verily	1
givest	1
thanks	1
well,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
edified.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues	1
more	1
than	1
ye	1
all:	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
speak	1
five	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
understanding,	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
voice	1
I	1
might	1
teach	1
others	1
also,	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue.	1
	1
14:20	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
children	1
in	1
understanding:	1
howbeit	1
in	1
malice	1
be	1
ye	1
children,	1
but	1
in	1
understanding	1
be	1
men.	1
	1
14:21	1
In	1
the	1
law	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
With	1
men	1
of	1
other	1
tongues	1
and	1
other	1
lips	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
this	1
people;	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
hear	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Wherefore	1
tongues	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
sign,	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not:	1
but	1
prophesying	1
serveth	1
not	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
believe.	1
	1
14:23	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
be	1
come	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned,	1
or	1
unbelievers,	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
mad?	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
or	1
one	1
unlearned,	1
he	1
is	1
convinced	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
all:	1
14:25	1
And	1
thus	1
are	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
made	1
manifest;	1
and	1
so	1
falling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
will	1
worship	1
God,	1
and	1
report	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
14:26	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
then,	1
brethren?	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
hath	1
a	1
psalm,	1
hath	1
a	1
doctrine,	1
hath	1
a	1
tongue,	1
hath	1
a	1
revelation,	1
hath	1
an	1
interpretation.	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:27	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
two,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
by	1
three,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
course;	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
interpreter,	1
let	1
him	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:29	1
Let	1
the	1
prophets	1
speak	1
two	1
or	1
three,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
judge.	1
	1
14:30	1
If	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
sitteth	1
by,	1
let	1
the	1
first	1
hold	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
14:31	1
For	1
ye	1
may	1
all	1
prophesy	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
learn,	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
14:33	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
confusion,	1
but	1
of	1
peace,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
14:34	1
Let	1
your	1
women	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
churches:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
speak;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
obedience	1
as	1
also	1
saith	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
learn	1
any	1
thing,	1
let	1
them	1
ask	1
their	1
husbands	1
at	1
home:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
women	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:36	1
What?	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
from	1
you?	1
or	1
came	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
only?	1
	1
14:37	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
spiritual,	1
let	1
him	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
ignorant.	1
	1
14:39	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
covet	1
to	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues.	1
	1
14:40	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
decently	1
and	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
15:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
and	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand;	1
15:2	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
saved,	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
in	1
memory	1
what	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
unless	1
ye	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
received,	1
how	1
that	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
our	1
sins	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
15:4	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures:	1
15:5	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
Cephas,	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
twelve:	1
15:6	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
above	1
five	1
hundred	1
brethren	1
at	1
once;	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
remain	1
unto	1
this	1
present,	1
but	1
some	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
	1
15:7	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
James;	1
then	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
me	1
also,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
born	1
out	1
of	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
that	1
am	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
apostle,	1
because	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
what	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
his	1
grace	1
which	1
was	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain;	1
but	1
I	1
laboured	1
more	1
abundantly	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
Therefore	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
I	1
or	1
they,	1
so	1
we	1
preach,	1
and	1
so	1
ye	1
believed.	1
	1
15:12	1
Now	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
preached	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
how	1
say	1
some	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
then	1
is	1
Christ	1
not	1
risen:	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
risen,	1
then	1
is	1
our	1
preaching	1
vain,	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
also	1
vain.	1
	1
15:15	1
Yea,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
found	1
false	1
witnesses	1
of	1
God;	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ:	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
not	1
up,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not.	1
	1
15:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not,	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
Christ	1
raised:	1
15:17	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
raised,	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
vain;	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
15:18	1
Then	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
perished.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
only	1
we	1
have	1
hope	1
in	1
Christ,	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
most	1
miserable.	1
	1
15:20	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
Christ	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slept.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
since	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
death,	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
Adam	1
all	1
die,	1
even	1
so	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
made	1
alive.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
order:	1
Christ	1
the	1
firstfruits;	1
afterward	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
15:24	1
Then	1
cometh	1
the	1
end,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
rule	1
and	1
all	1
authority	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
15:25	1
For	1
he	1
must	1
reign,	1
till	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
enemies	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
15:26	1
The	1
last	1
enemy	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
15:27	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saith	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
put	1
under	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
manifest	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
excepted,	1
which	1
did	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
subdued	1
unto	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
also	1
himself	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
15:29	1
Else	1
what	1
shall	1
they	1
do	1
which	1
are	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not	1
at	1
all?	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
then	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
why	1
stand	1
we	1
in	1
jeopardy	1
every	1
hour?	1
	1
15:31	1
I	1
protest	1
by	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
LORD,	1
I	1
die	1
daily.	1
	1
15:32	1
If	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
with	1
beasts	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
advantageth	1
it	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not?	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
15:33	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
evil	1
communications	1
corrupt	1
good	1
manners.	1
	1
15:34	1
Awake	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sin	1
not;	1
for	1
some	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
	1
15:35	1
But	1
some	1
man	1
will	1
say,	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
raised	1
up?	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
body	1
do	1
they	1
come?	1
	1
15:36	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest	1
is	1
not	1
quickened,	1
except	1
it	1
die:	1
15:37	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest,	1
thou	1
sowest	1
not	1
that	1
body	1
that	1
shall	1
be,	1
but	1
bare	1
grain,	1
it	1
may	1
chance	1
of	1
wheat,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
grain:	1
15:38	1
But	1
God	1
giveth	1
it	1
a	1
body	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
seed	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
15:39	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flesh:	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
flesh	1
of	1
men,	1
another	1
flesh	1
of	1
beasts,	1
another	1
of	1
fishes,	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
are	1
also	1
celestial	1
bodies,	1
and	1
bodies	1
terrestrial:	1
but	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
celestial	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
is	1
another.	1
	1
15:41	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
stars:	1
for	1
one	1
star	1
differeth	1
from	1
another	1
star	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
15:42	1
So	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
corruption;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
incorruption:	1
15:43	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
glory:	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
weakness;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
power:	1
15:44	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
a	1
natural	1
body;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
body,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
living	1
soul;	1
the	1
last	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
quickening	1
spirit.	1
	1
15:46	1
Howbeit	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
first	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
natural;	1
and	1
afterward	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual.	1
	1
15:47	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
earthy;	1
the	1
second	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
15:48	1
As	1
is	1
the	1
earthy,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
earthy:	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
heavenly,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:49	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
earthy,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
bear	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:50	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
neither	1
doth	1
corruption	1
inherit	1
incorruption.	1
	1
15:51	1
Behold,	1
I	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
mystery;	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
all	1
sleep,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
changed,	1
15:52	1
In	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
trump:	1
for	1
the	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
sound,	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
15:53	1
For	1
this	1
corruptible	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
immortality.	1
	1
15:54	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
corruptible	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
immortality,	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
Death	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
victory.	1
	1
15:55	1
O	1
death,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
sting?	1
O	1
grave,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
victory?	1
15:56	1
The	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
sin;	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
15:57	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
giveth	1
us	1
the	1
victory	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:58	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
be	1
ye	1
stedfast,	1
unmoveable,	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
labour	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
collection	1
for	1
the	1
saints,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
even	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
16:2	1
Upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
lay	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
store,	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
prospered	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
gatherings	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
whomsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
approve	1
by	1
your	1
letters,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
liberality	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
meet	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
also,	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:5	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia:	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
abide,	1
yea,	1
and	1
winter	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bring	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
journey	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
16:7	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
tarry	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
permit.	1
	1
16:8	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
at	1
Ephesus	1
until	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
a	1
great	1
door	1
and	1
effectual	1
is	1
opened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
adversaries.	1
	1
16:10	1
Now	1
if	1
Timotheus	1
come,	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
fear:	1
for	1
he	1
worketh	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
do.	1
	1
16:11	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
despise	1
him:	1
but	1
conduct	1
him	1
forth	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:12	1
As	1
touching	1
our	1
brother	1
Apollos,	1
I	1
greatly	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
brethren:	1
but	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
this	1
time;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
convenient	1
time.	1
	1
16:13	1
Watch	1
ye,	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
quit	1
you	1
like	1
men,	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:14	1
Let	1
all	1
your	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
charity.	1
	1
16:15	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
(ye	1
know	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Stephanas,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
addicted	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
saints,)	1
16:16	1
That	1
ye	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
such,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
helpeth	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
laboureth.	1
	1
16:17	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Stephanas	1
and	1
Fortunatus	1
and	1
Achaicus:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
they	1
have	1
supplied.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
refreshed	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
your's:	1
therefore	1
acknowledge	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such.	1
	1
16:19	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Asia	1
salute	1
you.	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
salute	1
you	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
	1
16:20	1
All	1
the	1
brethren	1
greet	1
you.	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
16:21	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
me	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
16:22	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
Anathema	1
Maranatha.	1
	1
16:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
My	1
love	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Achaia:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
mercies,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
comfort;	1
1:4	1
Who	1
comforteth	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
trouble,	1
by	1
the	1
comfort	1
wherewith	1
we	1
ourselves	1
are	1
comforted	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ	1
abound	1
in	1
us,	1
so	1
our	1
consolation	1
also	1
aboundeth	1
by	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation,	1
which	1
is	1
effectual	1
in	1
the	1
enduring	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sufferings	1
which	1
we	1
also	1
suffer:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
comforted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
our	1
hope	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
stedfast,	1
knowing,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
we	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant	1
of	1
our	1
trouble	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
Asia,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
pressed	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
above	1
strength,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
despaired	1
even	1
of	1
life:	1
1:9	1
But	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
in	1
God	1
which	1
raiseth	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:10	1
Who	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
death,	1
and	1
doth	1
deliver:	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1
trust	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
yet	1
deliver	1
us;	1
1:11	1
Ye	1
also	1
helping	1
together	1
by	1
prayer	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
thanks	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
many	1
on	1
our	1
behalf.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
this,	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
conscience,	1
that	1
in	1
simplicity	1
and	1
godly	1
sincerity,	1
not	1
with	1
fleshly	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
you-ward.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
we	1
write	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
than	1
what	1
ye	1
read	1
or	1
acknowledge;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
ye	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
1:14	1
As	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
acknowledged	1
us	1
in	1
part,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
your	1
rejoicing,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
our's	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
I	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
second	1
benefit;	1
1:16	1
And	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
toward	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:17	1
When	1
I	1
therefore	1
was	1
thus	1
minded,	1
did	1
I	1
use	1
lightness?	1
or	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
purpose,	1
do	1
I	1
purpose	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
with	1
me	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
yea	1
yea,	1
and	1
nay	1
nay?	1
	1
1:18	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
is	1
true,	1
our	1
word	1
toward	1
you	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
was	1
preached	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
us,	1
even	1
by	1
me	1
and	1
Silvanus	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay,	1
but	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
yea.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him	1
are	1
yea,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
Amen,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
us.	1
	1
1:21	1
Now	1
he	1
which	1
stablisheth	1
us	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
anointed	1
us,	1
is	1
God;	1
1:22	1
Who	1
hath	1
also	1
sealed	1
us,	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:23	1
Moreover	1
I	1
call	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
record	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
to	1
spare	1
you	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
unto	1
Corinth.	1
	1
1:24	1
Not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
your	1
faith,	1
but	1
are	1
helpers	1
of	1
your	1
joy:	1
for	1
by	1
faith	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
I	1
determined	1
this	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
heaviness.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
you	1
sorry,	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
that	1
maketh	1
me	1
glad,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
is	1
made	1
sorry	1
by	1
me?	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
wrote	1
this	1
same	1
unto	1
you,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
from	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
rejoice;	1
having	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
many	1
tears;	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
grieved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
have	1
caused	1
grief,	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
grieved	1
me,	1
but	1
in	1
part:	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
overcharge	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:6	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
punishment,	1
which	1
was	1
inflicted	1
of	1
many.	1
	1
2:7	1
So	1
that	1
contrariwise	1
ye	1
ought	1
rather	1
to	1
forgive	1
him,	1
and	1
comfort	1
him,	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
with	1
overmuch	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:8	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
confirm	1
your	1
love	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
also	1
did	1
I	1
write,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
you,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
obedient	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:10	1
To	1
whom	1
ye	1
forgive	1
any	1
thing,	1
I	1
forgive	1
also:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
forgave	1
any	1
thing,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
forgave	1
it,	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
forgave	1
I	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:11	1
Lest	1
Satan	1
should	1
get	1
an	1
advantage	1
of	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
devices.	1
	1
2:12	1
Furthermore,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Troas	1
to	1
preach	1
Christ's	1
gospel,	1
and	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
2:13	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
spirit,	1
because	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
Titus	1
my	1
brother:	1
but	1
taking	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
2:14	1
Now	1
thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
always	1
causeth	1
us	1
to	1
triumph	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
maketh	1
manifest	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
every	1
place.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
of	1
Christ,	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
saved,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish:	1
2:16	1
To	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
death	1
unto	1
death;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
life	1
unto	1
life.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
many,	1
which	1
corrupt	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
sincerity,	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
speak	1
we	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
Do	1
we	1
begin	1
again	1
to	1
commend	1
ourselves?	1
or	1
need	1
we,	1
as	1
some	1
others,	1
epistles	1
of	1
commendation	1
to	1
you,	1
or	1
letters	1
of	1
commendation	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
epistle	1
written	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
known	1
and	1
read	1
of	1
all	1
men:	1
3:3	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
manifestly	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
Christ	1
ministered	1
by	1
us,	1
written	1
not	1
with	1
ink,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
not	1
in	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
but	1
in	1
fleshy	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
such	1
trust	1
have	1
we	1
through	1
Christ	1
to	1
God-ward:	1
3:5	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sufficient	1
of	1
ourselves	1
to	1
think	1
any	1
thing	1
as	1
of	1
ourselves;	1
but	1
our	1
sufficiency	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
3:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
able	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament;	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
letter	1
killeth,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
giveth	1
life.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
death,	1
written	1
and	1
engraven	1
in	1
stones,	1
was	1
glorious,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
countenance;	1
which	1
glory	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
away:	1
3:8	1
How	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
rather	1
glorious?	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
condemnation	1
be	1
glory,	1
much	1
more	1
doth	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
righteousness	1
exceed	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
glorious	1
had	1
no	1
glory	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
excelleth.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
was	1
glorious,	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
is	1
glorious.	1
	1
3:12	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
such	1
hope,	1
we	1
use	1
great	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech:	1
3:13	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
Moses,	1
which	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
abolished:	1
3:14	1
But	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
blinded:	1
for	1
until	1
this	1
day	1
remaineth	1
the	1
same	1
vail	1
untaken	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament;	1
which	1
vail	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
when	1
Moses	1
is	1
read,	1
the	1
vail	1
is	1
upon	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
vail	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
that	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
liberty.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
we	1
all,	1
with	1
open	1
face	1
beholding	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
are	1
changed	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
image	1
from	1
glory	1
to	1
glory,	1
even	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
ministry,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
mercy,	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
4:2	1
But	1
have	1
renounced	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
dishonesty,	1
not	1
walking	1
in	1
craftiness,	1
nor	1
handling	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
deceitfully;	1
but	1
by	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
conscience	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
gospel	1
be	1
hid,	1
it	1
is	1
hid	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
lost:	1
4:4	1
In	1
whom	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
hath	1
blinded	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
not,	1
lest	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God,	1
should	1
shine	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
we	1
preach	1
not	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
ourselves	1
your	1
servants	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
God,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
shine	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
hath	1
shined	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
treasure	1
in	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
that	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
4:8	1
We	1
are	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
yet	1
not	1
distressed;	1
we	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
despair;	1
4:9	1
Persecuted,	1
but	1
not	1
forsaken;	1
cast	1
down,	1
but	1
not	1
destroyed;	1
4:10	1
Always	1
bearing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
the	1
dying	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
4:11	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
live	1
are	1
alway	1
delivered	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
mortal	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:12	1
So	1
then	1
death	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
4:13	1
We	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
of	1
faith,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
believed,	1
and	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
spoken;	1
we	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
therefore	1
speak;	1
4:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
also	1
by	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shall	1
present	1
us	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
that	1
the	1
abundant	1
grace	1
might	1
through	1
the	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
many	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
but	1
though	1
our	1
outward	1
man	1
perish,	1
yet	1
the	1
inward	1
man	1
is	1
renewed	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
our	1
light	1
affliction,	1
which	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
worketh	1
for	1
us	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
exceeding	1
and	1
eternal	1
weight	1
of	1
glory;	1
4:18	1
While	1
we	1
look	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
are	1
temporal;	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen	1
are	1
eternal.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
our	1
earthly	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
were	1
dissolved,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
building	1
of	1
God,	1
an	1
house	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
eternal	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
we	1
groan,	1
earnestly	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
clothed	1
upon	1
with	1
our	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
heaven:	1
5:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
being	1
clothed	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
naked.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
we	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
do	1
groan,	1
being	1
burdened:	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
unclothed,	1
but	1
clothed	1
upon,	1
that	1
mortality	1
might	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
wrought	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
thing	1
is	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
confident,	1
knowing	1
that,	1
whilst	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:7	1
(For	1
we	1
walk	1
by	1
faith,	1
not	1
by	1
sight:)	1
5:8	1
We	1
are	1
confident,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
willing	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
labour,	1
that,	1
whether	1
present	1
or	1
absent,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
5:11	1
Knowing	1
therefore	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
we	1
persuade	1
men;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
God;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
also	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
your	1
consciences.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
we	1
commend	1
not	1
ourselves	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
give	1
you	1
occasion	1
to	1
glory	1
on	1
our	1
behalf,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
answer	1
them	1
which	1
glory	1
in	1
appearance,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
beside	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
God:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
sober,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
cause.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ	1
constraineth	1
us;	1
because	1
we	1
thus	1
judge,	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
then	1
were	1
all	1
dead:	1
5:15	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
live	1
should	1
not	1
henceforth	1
live	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
died	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
rose	1
again.	1
	1
5:16	1
Wherefore	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
yea,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
Christ	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
now	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
him	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
5:17	1
Therefore	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
creature:	1
old	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away;	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
become	1
new.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
reconciled	1
us	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
reconciliation;	1
5:19	1
To	1
wit,	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Christ,	1
reconciling	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
himself,	1
not	1
imputing	1
their	1
trespasses	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
hath	1
committed	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
5:20	1
Now	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
ambassadors	1
for	1
Christ,	1
as	1
though	1
God	1
did	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
us:	1
we	1
pray	1
you	1
in	1
Christ's	1
stead,	1
be	1
ye	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sin	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
knew	1
no	1
sin;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:1	1
We	1
then,	1
as	1
workers	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
beseech	1
you	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
6:2	1
(For	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
accepted,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
succoured	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
time;	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation.)	1
	1
6:3	1
Giving	1
no	1
offence	1
in	1
any	1
thing,	1
that	1
the	1
ministry	1
be	1
not	1
blamed:	1
6:4	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
approving	1
ourselves	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
much	1
patience,	1
in	1
afflictions,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
distresses,	1
6:5	1
In	1
stripes,	1
in	1
imprisonments,	1
in	1
tumults,	1
in	1
labours,	1
in	1
watchings,	1
in	1
fastings;	1
6:6	1
By	1
pureness,	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
by	1
longsuffering,	1
by	1
kindness,	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
by	1
love	1
unfeigned,	1
6:7	1
By	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
by	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
righteousness	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
6:8	1
By	1
honour	1
and	1
dishonour,	1
by	1
evil	1
report	1
and	1
good	1
report:	1
as	1
deceivers,	1
and	1
yet	1
true;	1
6:9	1
As	1
unknown,	1
and	1
yet	1
well	1
known;	1
as	1
dying,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
live;	1
as	1
chastened,	1
and	1
not	1
killed;	1
6:10	1
As	1
sorrowful,	1
yet	1
alway	1
rejoicing;	1
as	1
poor,	1
yet	1
making	1
many	1
rich;	1
as	1
having	1
nothing,	1
and	1
yet	1
possessing	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
6:11	1
O	1
ye	1
Corinthians,	1
our	1
mouth	1
is	1
open	1
unto	1
you,	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
straitened	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
straitened	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
bowels.	1
	1
6:13	1
Now	1
for	1
a	1
recompence	1
in	1
the	1
same,	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
unto	1
my	1
children,)	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:14	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
unequally	1
yoked	1
together	1
with	1
unbelievers:	1
for	1
what	1
fellowship	1
hath	1
righteousness	1
with	1
unrighteousness?	1
and	1
what	1
communion	1
hath	1
light	1
with	1
darkness?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
what	1
concord	1
hath	1
Christ	1
with	1
Belial?	1
or	1
what	1
part	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
with	1
an	1
infidel?	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
what	1
agreement	1
hath	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
idols?	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
separate,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
Father	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Almighty.	1
	1
7:1	1
Having	1
therefore	1
these	1
promises,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
cleanse	1
ourselves	1
from	1
all	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
spirit,	1
perfecting	1
holiness	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:2	1
Receive	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
wronged	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
corrupted	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
defrauded	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
7:3	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
condemn	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
7:4	1
Great	1
is	1
my	1
boldness	1
of	1
speech	1
toward	1
you,	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
glorying	1
of	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
comfort,	1
I	1
am	1
exceeding	1
joyful	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation.	1
	1
7:5	1
For,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
our	1
flesh	1
had	1
no	1
rest,	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
without	1
were	1
fightings,	1
within	1
were	1
fears.	1
	1
7:6	1
Nevertheless	1
God,	1
that	1
comforteth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
comforted	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Titus;	1
7:7	1
And	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
coming	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
consolation	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
in	1
you,	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
your	1
earnest	1
desire,	1
your	1
mourning,	1
your	1
fervent	1
mind	1
toward	1
me;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
made	1
you	1
sorry	1
with	1
a	1
letter,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
repent,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
repent:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
epistle	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
sorry,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
7:9	1
Now	1
I	1
rejoice,	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
to	1
repentance:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
manner,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
damage	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
godly	1
sorrow	1
worketh	1
repentance	1
to	1
salvation	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
repented	1
of:	1
but	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
worketh	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
selfsame	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
what	1
carefulness	1
it	1
wrought	1
in	1
you,	1
yea,	1
what	1
clearing	1
of	1
yourselves,	1
yea,	1
what	1
indignation,	1
yea,	1
what	1
fear,	1
yea,	1
what	1
vehement	1
desire,	1
yea,	1
what	1
zeal,	1
yea,	1
what	1
revenge!	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
approved	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
wrong,	1
nor	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
suffered	1
wrong,	1
but	1
that	1
our	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
in	1
your	1
comfort:	1
yea,	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
the	1
more	1
joyed	1
we	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Titus,	1
because	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
refreshed	1
by	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
boasted	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
spake	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
truth,	1
even	1
so	1
our	1
boasting,	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
before	1
Titus,	1
is	1
found	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
his	1
inward	1
affection	1
is	1
more	1
abundant	1
toward	1
you,	1
whilst	1
he	1
remembereth	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
how	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
ye	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
rejoice	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
do	1
you	1
to	1
wit	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
bestowed	1
on	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Macedonia;	1
8:2	1
How	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
trial	1
of	1
affliction	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
their	1
joy	1
and	1
their	1
deep	1
poverty	1
abounded	1
unto	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
their	1
liberality.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
to	1
their	1
power,	1
I	1
bear	1
record,	1
yea,	1
and	1
beyond	1
their	1
power	1
they	1
were	1
willing	1
of	1
themselves;	1
8:4	1
Praying	1
us	1
with	1
much	1
intreaty	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
gift,	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
did,	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
hoped,	1
but	1
first	1
gave	1
their	1
own	1
selves	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:6	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
finish	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:7	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
every	1
thing,	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
utterance,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
diligence,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
love	1
to	1
us,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
this	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:8	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
by	1
commandment,	1
but	1
by	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
your	1
love.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
rich,	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
he	1
became	1
poor,	1
that	1
ye	1
through	1
his	1
poverty	1
might	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
herein	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
advice:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
begun	1
before,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
forward	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
perform	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
it;	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
will,	1
so	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
first	1
a	1
willing	1
mind,	1
it	1
is	1
accepted	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath,	1
and	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
that	1
other	1
men	1
be	1
eased,	1
and	1
ye	1
burdened:	1
8:14	1
But	1
by	1
an	1
equality,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
your	1
abundance	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
their	1
want,	1
that	1
their	1
abundance	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
your	1
want:	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
equality:	1
8:15	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack.	1
	1
8:16	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
put	1
the	1
same	1
earnest	1
care	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Titus	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
exhortation;	1
but	1
being	1
more	1
forward,	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
brother,	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
churches;	1
8:19	1
And	1
not	1
that	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chosen	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
us	1
with	1
this	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Lord,	1
and	1
declaration	1
of	1
your	1
ready	1
mind:	1
8:20	1
Avoiding	1
this,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
blame	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
abundance	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us:	1
8:21	1
Providing	1
for	1
honest	1
things,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
them	1
our	1
brother,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
oftentimes	1
proved	1
diligent	1
in	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
diligent,	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:23	1
Whether	1
any	1
do	1
enquire	1
of	1
Titus,	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
fellowhelper	1
concerning	1
you:	1
or	1
our	1
brethren	1
be	1
enquired	1
of,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
churches,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:24	1
Wherefore	1
shew	1
ye	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
churches,	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
your	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
boasting	1
on	1
your	1
behalf.	1
	1
9:1	1
For	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
it	1
is	1
superfluous	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you:	1
9:2	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
boast	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
Achaia	1
was	1
ready	1
a	1
year	1
ago;	1
and	1
your	1
zeal	1
hath	1
provoked	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
9:3	1
Yet	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
our	1
boasting	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
this	1
behalf;	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
ready:	1
9:4	1
Lest	1
haply	1
if	1
they	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
you	1
unprepared,	1
we	1
(that	1
we	1
say	1
not,	1
ye)	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
confident	1
boasting.	1
	1
9:5	1
Therefore	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
exhort	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
before	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
beforehand	1
your	1
bounty,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
had	1
notice	1
before,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
might	1
be	1
ready,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
bounty,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
of	1
covetousness.	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
He	1
which	1
soweth	1
sparingly	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
sparingly;	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
soweth	1
bountifully	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
bountifully.	1
	1
9:7	1
Every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
purposeth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
give;	1
not	1
grudgingly,	1
or	1
of	1
necessity:	1
for	1
God	1
loveth	1
a	1
cheerful	1
giver.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
grace	1
abound	1
toward	1
you;	1
that	1
ye,	1
always	1
having	1
all	1
sufficiency	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work:	1
9:9	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
hath	1
dispersed	1
abroad;	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor:	1
his	1
righteousness	1
remaineth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:10	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
ministereth	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1
sower	1
both	1
minister	1
bread	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
sown,	1
and	1
increase	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
righteousness;)	1
9:11	1
Being	1
enriched	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
all	1
bountifulness,	1
which	1
causeth	1
through	1
us	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
9:12	1
For	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
this	1
service	1
not	1
only	1
supplieth	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
but	1
is	1
abundant	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
thanksgivings	1
unto	1
God;	1
9:13	1
Whiles	1
by	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
ministration	1
they	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
professed	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
liberal	1
distribution	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
men;	1
9:14	1
And	1
by	1
their	1
prayer	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
exceeding	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
9:15	1
Thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
unspeakable	1
gift.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
I	1
Paul	1
myself	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
meekness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
in	1
presence	1
am	1
base	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
being	1
absent	1
am	1
bold	1
toward	1
you:	1
10:2	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
bold	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
that	1
confidence,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
bold	1
against	1
some,	1
which	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
though	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
war	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
10:4	1
(For	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
our	1
warfare	1
are	1
not	1
carnal,	1
but	1
mighty	1
through	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
pulling	1
down	1
of	1
strong	1
holds;)	1
10:5	1
Casting	1
down	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
every	1
high	1
thing	1
that	1
exalteth	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
bringing	1
into	1
captivity	1
every	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
Christ;	1
10:6	1
And	1
having	1
in	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
revenge	1
all	1
disobedience,	1
when	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:7	1
Do	1
ye	1
look	1
on	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
trust	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
let	1
him	1
of	1
himself	1
think	1
this	1
again,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
even	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
Christ's.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
boast	1
somewhat	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
authority,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
for	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
destruction,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
10:9	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
terrify	1
you	1
by	1
letters.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
his	1
letters,	1
say	1
they,	1
are	1
weighty	1
and	1
powerful;	1
but	1
his	1
bodily	1
presence	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
his	1
speech	1
contemptible.	1
	1
10:11	1
Let	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
think	1
this,	1
that,	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
word	1
by	1
letters	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent,	1
such	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
deed	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
present.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
make	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
or	1
compare	1
ourselves	1
with	1
some	1
that	1
commend	1
themselves:	1
but	1
they	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
comparing	1
themselves	1
among	1
themselves,	1
are	1
not	1
wise.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
us,	1
a	1
measure	1
to	1
reach	1
even	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
we	1
stretch	1
not	1
ourselves	1
beyond	1
our	1
measure,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
reached	1
not	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
come	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
10:15	1
Not	1
boasting	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
labours;	1
but	1
having	1
hope,	1
when	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
increased,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
enlarged	1
by	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
rule	1
abundantly,	1
10:16	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
beyond	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
boast	1
in	1
another	1
man's	1
line	1
of	1
things	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
commendeth	1
himself	1
is	1
approved,	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
commendeth.	1
	1
11:1	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
could	1
bear	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
my	1
folly:	1
and	1
indeed	1
bear	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
over	1
you	1
with	1
godly	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
espoused	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
husband,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
present	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
chaste	1
virgin	1
to	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
as	1
the	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
Eve	1
through	1
his	1
subtilty,	1
so	1
your	1
minds	1
should	1
be	1
corrupted	1
from	1
the	1
simplicity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
preacheth	1
another	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
preached,	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
receive	1
another	1
spirit,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received,	1
or	1
another	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
accepted,	1
ye	1
might	1
well	1
bear	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
For	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
rude	1
in	1
speech,	1
yet	1
not	1
in	1
knowledge;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
throughly	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
11:7	1
Have	1
I	1
committed	1
an	1
offence	1
in	1
abasing	1
myself	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
exalted,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
freely?	1
11:8	1
I	1
robbed	1
other	1
churches,	1
taking	1
wages	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
service.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
present	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
wanted,	1
I	1
was	1
chargeable	1
to	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Macedonia	1
supplied:	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
being	1
burdensome	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
myself.	1
	1
11:10	1
As	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
stop	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
boasting	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Achaia.	1
	1
11:11	1
Wherefore?	1
because	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
not?	1
God	1
knoweth.	1
	1
11:12	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
occasion	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
desire	1
occasion;	1
that	1
wherein	1
they	1
glory,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
we.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
such	1
are	1
false	1
apostles,	1
deceitful	1
workers,	1
transforming	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
no	1
marvel;	1
for	1
Satan	1
himself	1
is	1
transformed	1
into	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
11:15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
his	1
ministers	1
also	1
be	1
transformed	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
whose	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
11:16	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
fool;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
yet	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
receive	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
boast	1
myself	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
11:17	1
That	1
which	1
I	1
speak,	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
foolishly,	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
of	1
boasting.	1
	1
11:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
many	1
glory	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
also.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer	1
fools	1
gladly,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
wise.	1
	1
11:20	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
bondage,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
devour	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
of	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
11:21	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
concerning	1
reproach,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
weak.	1
Howbeit	1
whereinsoever	1
any	1
is	1
bold,	1
(I	1
speak	1
foolishly,)	1
I	1
am	1
bold	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
Are	1
they	1
Hebrews?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
Israelites?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
11:23	1
Are	1
they	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
fool)	1
I	1
am	1
more;	1
in	1
labours	1
more	1
abundant,	1
in	1
stripes	1
above	1
measure,	1
in	1
prisons	1
more	1
frequent,	1
in	1
deaths	1
oft.	1
	1
11:24	1
Of	1
the	1
Jews	1
five	1
times	1
received	1
I	1
forty	1
stripes	1
save	1
one.	1
	1
11:25	1
Thrice	1
was	1
I	1
beaten	1
with	1
rods,	1
once	1
was	1
I	1
stoned,	1
thrice	1
I	1
suffered	1
shipwreck,	1
a	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
deep;	1
11:26	1
In	1
journeyings	1
often,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
waters,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
robbers,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
mine	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
perils	1
among	1
false	1
brethren;	1
11:27	1
In	1
weariness	1
and	1
painfulness,	1
in	1
watchings	1
often,	1
in	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst,	1
in	1
fastings	1
often,	1
in	1
cold	1
and	1
nakedness.	1
	1
11:28	1
Beside	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
upon	1
me	1
daily,	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
11:29	1
Who	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
weak?	1
who	1
is	1
offended,	1
and	1
I	1
burn	1
not?	1
11:30	1
If	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
glory,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
evermore,	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
11:32	1
In	1
Damascus	1
the	1
governor	1
under	1
Aretas	1
the	1
king	1
kept	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Damascenes	1
with	1
a	1
garrison,	1
desirous	1
to	1
apprehend	1
me:	1
11:33	1
And	1
through	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
was	1
I	1
let	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
escaped	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:1	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
for	1
me	1
doubtless	1
to	1
glory.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
visions	1
and	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:2	1
I	1
knew	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Christ	1
above	1
fourteen	1
years	1
ago,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell;	1
or	1
whether	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
caught	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
12:4	1
How	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
paradise,	1
and	1
heard	1
unspeakable	1
words,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
utter.	1
	1
12:5	1
Of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
will	1
I	1
glory:	1
yet	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
glory,	1
but	1
in	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
to	1
glory,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
fool;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
the	1
truth:	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
forbear,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeth	1
me	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
revelations,	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
thorn	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
Satan	1
to	1
buffet	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
besought	1
the	1
Lord	1
thrice,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
thee:	1
for	1
my	1
strength	1
is	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
weakness.	1
Most	1
gladly	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
rather	1
glory	1
in	1
my	1
infirmities,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Christ	1
may	1
rest	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
12:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
infirmities,	1
in	1
reproaches,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
persecutions,	1
in	1
distresses	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake:	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
weak,	1
then	1
am	1
I	1
strong.	1
	1
12:11	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
glorying;	1
ye	1
have	1
compelled	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
commended	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
in	1
nothing	1
am	1
I	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
12:12	1
Truly	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
an	1
apostle	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
patience,	1
in	1
signs,	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
mighty	1
deeds.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
inferior	1
to	1
other	1
churches,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
not	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you?	1
forgive	1
me	1
this	1
wrong.	1
	1
12:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
your's	1
but	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
parents,	1
but	1
the	1
parents	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
very	1
gladly	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
for	1
you;	1
though	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
the	1
less	1
I	1
be	1
loved.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
be	1
it	1
so,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
burden	1
you:	1
nevertheless,	1
being	1
crafty,	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
with	1
guile.	1
	1
12:17	1
Did	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you?	1
12:18	1
I	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
sent	1
a	1
brother.	1
Did	1
Titus	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spirit?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
steps?	1
	1
12:19	1
Again,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
excuse	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
you?	1
we	1
speak	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
Christ:	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
all	1
things,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
for	1
your	1
edifying.	1
	1
12:20	1
For	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
not:	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
debates,	1
envyings,	1
wraths,	1
strifes,	1
backbitings,	1
whisperings,	1
swellings,	1
tumults:	1
12:21	1
And	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
humble	1
me	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
bewail	1
many	1
which	1
have	1
sinned	1
already,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
fornication	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
13:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
In	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
shall	1
every	1
word	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
13:2	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
and	1
foretell	1
you,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
the	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
being	1
absent	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
heretofore	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
spare:	1
13:3	1
Since	1
ye	1
seek	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
Christ	1
speaking	1
in	1
me,	1
which	1
to	1
you-ward	1
is	1
not	1
weak,	1
but	1
is	1
mighty	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
13:4	1
For	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
through	1
weakness,	1
yet	1
he	1
liveth	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
weak	1
in	1
him,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
you.	1
	1
13:5	1
Examine	1
yourselves,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
prove	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
selves,	1
how	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
except	1
ye	1
be	1
reprobates?	1
	1
13:6	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:7	1
Now	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
no	1
evil;	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
appear	1
approved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
honest,	1
though	1
we	1
be	1
as	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
strong:	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
we	1
wish,	1
even	1
your	1
perfection.	1
	1
13:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
write	1
these	1
things	1
being	1
absent,	1
lest	1
being	1
present	1
I	1
should	1
use	1
sharpness,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
13:11	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
farewell.	1
Be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
be	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
live	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:12	1
Greet	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
13:13	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:14	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Galatians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(not	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
by	1
man,	1
but	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead;)	1
1:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:4	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
evil	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father:	1
1:5	1
To	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:6	1
I	1
marvel	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
so	1
soon	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
called	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
another	1
gospel:	1
1:7	1
Which	1
is	1
not	1
another;	1
but	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
that	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
pervert	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
though	1
we,	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
heaven,	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:9	1
As	1
we	1
said	1
before,	1
so	1
say	1
I	1
now	1
again,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
do	1
I	1
now	1
persuade	1
men,	1
or	1
God?	1
or	1
do	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
please	1
men?	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
pleased	1
men,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
But	1
I	1
certify	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
after	1
man.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
I	1
neither	1
received	1
it	1
of	1
man,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
taught	1
it,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion,	1
how	1
that	1
beyond	1
measure	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wasted	1
it:	1
1:14	1
And	1
profited	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion	1
above	1
many	1
my	1
equals	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
nation,	1
being	1
more	1
exceedingly	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
my	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:15	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
pleased	1
God,	1
who	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
1:16	1
To	1
reveal	1
his	1
Son	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
preach	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
heathen;	1
immediately	1
I	1
conferred	1
not	1
with	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood:	1
1:17	1
Neither	1
went	1
I	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
apostles	1
before	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
returned	1
again	1
unto	1
Damascus.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
after	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
see	1
Peter,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
fifteen	1
days.	1
	1
1:19	1
But	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
saw	1
I	1
none,	1
save	1
James	1
the	1
Lord's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:20	1
Now	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
behold,	1
before	1
God,	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
1:21	1
Afterwards	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia;	1
1:22	1
And	1
was	1
unknown	1
by	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Judaea	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:23	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
only,	1
That	1
he	1
which	1
persecuted	1
us	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
now	1
preacheth	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
once	1
he	1
destroyed.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
glorified	1
God	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
took	1
Titus	1
with	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
revelation,	1
and	1
communicated	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
but	1
privately	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
reputation,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
should	1
run,	1
or	1
had	1
run,	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:3	1
But	1
neither	1
Titus,	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me,	1
being	1
a	1
Greek,	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
2:4	1
And	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
false	1
brethren	1
unawares	1
brought	1
in,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
privily	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
our	1
liberty	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
bondage:	1
2:5	1
To	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
place	1
by	1
subjection,	1
no,	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
might	1
continue	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
of	1
these	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat,	1
(whatsoever	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
maketh	1
no	1
matter	1
to	1
me:	1
God	1
accepteth	1
no	1
man's	1
person:)	1
for	1
they	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
in	1
conference	1
added	1
nothing	1
to	1
me:	1
2:7	1
But	1
contrariwise,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
was	1
unto	1
Peter;	1
2:8	1
(For	1
he	1
that	1
wrought	1
effectually	1
in	1
Peter	1
to	1
the	1
apostleship	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
me	1
toward	1
the	1
Gentiles:)	1
2:9	1
And	1
when	1
James,	1
Cephas,	1
and	1
John,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pillars,	1
perceived	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
they	1
gave	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
the	1
right	1
hands	1
of	1
fellowship;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
unto	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:10	1
Only	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
poor;	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
forward	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
I	1
withstood	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
face,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
before	1
that	1
certain	1
came	1
from	1
James,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
and	1
separated	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
Jews	1
dissembled	1
likewise	1
with	1
him;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Barnabas	1
also	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
dissimulation.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
uprightly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
livest	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews,	1
why	1
compellest	1
thou	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
2:15	1
We	1
who	1
are	1
Jews	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
not	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
2:16	1
Knowing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
even	1
we	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
if,	1
while	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
Christ,	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
are	1
found	1
sinners,	1
is	1
therefore	1
Christ	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
a	1
transgressor.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
I	1
through	1
the	1
law	1
am	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
live	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
am	1
crucified	1
with	1
Christ:	1
neverthless	1
I	1
live;	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
Christ	1
liveth	1
in	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
frustrate	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
if	1
righteousness	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
then	1
Christ	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:1	1
O	1
foolish	1
Galatians,	1
who	1
hath	1
bewitched	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
before	1
whose	1
eyes	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
been	1
evidently	1
set	1
forth,	1
crucified	1
among	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
This	1
only	1
would	1
I	1
learn	1
of	1
you,	1
Received	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:3	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
foolish?	1
having	1
begun	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
are	1
ye	1
now	1
made	1
perfect	1
by	1
the	1
flesh?	1
	1
3:4	1
Have	1
ye	1
suffered	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
vain?	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
yet	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
ministereth	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
worketh	1
miracles	1
among	1
you,	1
doeth	1
he	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
accounted	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:7	1
Know	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
faith,	1
the	1
same	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
scripture,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
justify	1
the	1
heathen	1
through	1
faith,	1
preached	1
before	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
nations	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
of	1
faith	1
are	1
blessed	1
with	1
faithful	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
curse:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
continueth	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
3:11	1
But	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
it	1
is	1
evident:	1
for,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
but,	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
them	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:13	1
Christ	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
curse	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hangeth	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
3:14	1
That	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham	1
might	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:15	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men;	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
man's	1
covenant,	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
confirmed,	1
no	1
man	1
disannulleth,	1
or	1
addeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
to	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
were	1
the	1
promises	1
made.	1
He	1
saith	1
not,	1
And	1
to	1
seeds,	1
as	1
of	1
many;	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
one,	1
And	1
to	1
thy	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
covenant,	1
that	1
was	1
confirmed	1
before	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ,	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
after,	1
cannot	1
disannul,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
make	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
inheritance	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
promise:	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
3:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
serveth	1
the	1
law?	1
It	1
was	1
added	1
because	1
of	1
transgressions,	1
till	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
made;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
by	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
mediator.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
a	1
mediator	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mediator	1
of	1
one,	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
3:21	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
then	1
against	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
life,	1
verily	1
righteousness	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
concluded	1
all	1
under	1
sin,	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
3:23	1
But	1
before	1
faith	1
came,	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
should	1
afterwards	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
3:24	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
our	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:25	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
faith	1
is	1
come,	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
under	1
a	1
schoolmaster.	1
	1
3:26	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
have	1
been	1
baptized	1
into	1
Christ	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:28	1
There	1
is	1
neither	1
Jew	1
nor	1
Greek,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
bond	1
nor	1
free,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
male	1
nor	1
female:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
Christ's,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
I	1
say,	1
That	1
the	1
heir,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
differeth	1
nothing	1
from	1
a	1
servant,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
lord	1
of	1
all;	1
4:2	1
But	1
is	1
under	1
tutors	1
and	1
governors	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
father.	1
	1
4:3	1
Even	1
so	1
we,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
children,	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
under	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
4:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come,	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
Son,	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
4:5	1
To	1
redeem	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
sons.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
sons,	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
your	1
hearts,	1
crying,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
4:7	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
an	1
heir	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Howbeit	1
then,	1
when	1
ye	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
ye	1
did	1
service	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
by	1
nature	1
are	1
no	1
gods.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
now,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
God,	1
or	1
rather	1
are	1
known	1
of	1
God,	1
how	1
turn	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
beggarly	1
elements,	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
desire	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bondage?	1
	1
4:10	1
Ye	1
observe	1
days,	1
and	1
months,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
years.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,	1
lest	1
I	1
have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
you	1
labour	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
4:12	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
am;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
ye	1
are:	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
injured	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
4:13	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
through	1
infirmity	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
my	1
temptation	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
ye	1
despised	1
not,	1
nor	1
rejected;	1
but	1
received	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:15	1
Where	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
blessedness	1
ye	1
spake	1
of?	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
record,	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
plucked	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:16	1
Am	1
I	1
therefore	1
become	1
your	1
enemy,	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth?	1
4:17	1
They	1
zealously	1
affect	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
well;	1
yea,	1
they	1
would	1
exclude	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
affect	1
them.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
zealously	1
affected	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
travail	1
in	1
birth	1
again	1
until	1
Christ	1
be	1
formed	1
in	1
you,	1
4:20	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
voice;	1
for	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
doubt	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
4:21	1
Tell	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
Abraham	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman	1
was	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
4:24	1
Which	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
allegory:	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
covenants;	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
which	1
gendereth	1
to	1
bondage,	1
which	1
is	1
Agar.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
this	1
Agar	1
is	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
in	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
answereth	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
bondage	1
with	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
4:26	1
But	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
is	1
free,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Rejoice,	1
thou	1
barren	1
that	1
bearest	1
not;	1
break	1
forth	1
and	1
cry,	1
thou	1
that	1
travailest	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
desolate	1
hath	1
many	1
more	1
children	1
than	1
she	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband.	1
	1
4:28	1
Now	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
Isaac	1
was,	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
as	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
persecuted	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
	1
4:30	1
Nevertheless	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Cast	1
out	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:31	1
So	1
then,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
free.	1
	1
5:1	1
Stand	1
fast	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
Christ	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
free,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
entangled	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
5:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
Paul	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
Christ	1
shall	1
profit	1
you	1
nothing.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
again	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
whole	1
law.	1
	1
5:4	1
Christ	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
no	1
effect	1
unto	1
you,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
are	1
fallen	1
from	1
grace.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
we	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
righteousness	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision;	1
but	1
faith	1
which	1
worketh	1
by	1
love.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
did	1
run	1
well;	1
who	1
did	1
hinder	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth?	1
	1
5:8	1
This	1
persuasion	1
cometh	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth	1
you.	1
	1
5:9	1
A	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump.	1
	1
5:10	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
otherwise	1
minded:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
troubleth	1
you	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
judgment,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
preach	1
circumcision,	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
yet	1
suffer	1
persecution?	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
ceased.	1
	1
5:12	1
I	1
would	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
cut	1
off	1
which	1
trouble	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
For,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
unto	1
liberty;	1
only	1
use	1
not	1
liberty	1
for	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
by	1
love	1
serve	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
one	1
word,	1
even	1
in	1
this;	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
bite	1
and	1
devour	1
one	1
another,	1
take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
consumed	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
5:16	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
the	1
flesh	1
lusteth	1
against	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
against	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
contrary	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
would.	1
	1
5:18	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
led	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
5:19	1
Now	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
are	1
manifest,	1
which	1
are	1
these;	1
Adultery,	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
lasciviousness,	1
5:20	1
Idolatry,	1
witchcraft,	1
hatred,	1
variance,	1
emulations,	1
wrath,	1
strife,	1
seditions,	1
heresies,	1
5:21	1
Envyings,	1
murders,	1
drunkenness,	1
revellings,	1
and	1
such	1
like:	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
love,	1
joy,	1
peace,	1
longsuffering,	1
gentleness,	1
goodness,	1
faith,	1
5:23	1
Meekness,	1
temperance:	1
against	1
such	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
affections	1
and	1
lusts.	1
	1
5:25	1
If	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
let	1
us	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:26	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
vain	1
glory,	1
provoking	1
one	1
another,	1
envying	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
6:1	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
overtaken	1
in	1
a	1
fault,	1
ye	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual,	1
restore	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness;	1
considering	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
also	1
be	1
tempted.	1
	1
6:2	1
Bear	1
ye	1
one	1
another's	1
burdens,	1
and	1
so	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:3	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
something,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
nothing,	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
himself.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
work,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
himself	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
own	1
burden.	1
	1
6:6	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
communicate	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
teacheth	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
things.	1
	1
6:7	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived;	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
mocked:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
a	1
man	1
soweth,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
also	1
reap.	1
	1
6:8	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
reap	1
corruption;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
reap	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing:	1
for	1
in	1
due	1
season	1
we	1
shall	1
reap,	1
if	1
we	1
faint	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
opportunity,	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
good	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
especially	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
6:11	1
Ye	1
see	1
how	1
large	1
a	1
letter	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
6:12	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
shew	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
they	1
constrain	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
only	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
persecution	1
for	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
neither	1
they	1
themselves	1
who	1
are	1
circumcised	1
keep	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
glory	1
in	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:14	1
But	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
glory,	1
save	1
in	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
crucified	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
For	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
creature.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
walk	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
rule,	1
peace	1
be	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
Israel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:17	1
From	1
henceforth	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:18	1
Brethren,	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1

	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
faithful	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
blessed	1
us	1
with	1
all	1
spiritual	1
blessings	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:4	1
According	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
us	1
in	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blame	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
love:	1
1:5	1
Having	1
predestinated	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
children	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
1:6	1
To	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
beloved.	1
	1
1:7	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace;	1
1:8	1
Wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
abounded	1
toward	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prudence;	1
1:9	1
Having	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
in	1
himself:	1
1:10	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
times	1
he	1
might	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
Christ,	1
both	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
earth;	1
even	1
in	1
him:	1
1:11	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
being	1
predestinated	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
worketh	1
all	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will:	1
1:12	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
who	1
first	1
trusted	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
trusted,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
your	1
salvation:	1
in	1
whom	1
also	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
believed,	1
ye	1
were	1
sealed	1
with	1
that	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
promise,	1
1:14	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
until	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
purchased	1
possession,	1
unto	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
1:15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
also,	1
after	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
love	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:16	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
for	1
you,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:17	1
That	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
glory,	1
may	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
revelation	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him:	1
1:18	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
being	1
enlightened;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
calling,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:19	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
exceeding	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
us-ward	1
who	1
believe,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
power,	1
1:20	1
Which	1
he	1
wrought	1
in	1
Christ,	1
when	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
places,	1
1:21	1
Far	1
above	1
all	1
principality,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
every	1
name	1
that	1
is	1
named,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come:	1
1:22	1
And	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
church,	1
1:23	1
Which	1
is	1
his	1
body,	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
filleth	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
you	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened,	1
who	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
trespasses	1
and	1
sins;	1
2:2	1
Wherein	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
ye	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
now	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
2:3	1
Among	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
all	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
our	1
flesh,	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
mind;	1
and	1
were	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wrath,	1
even	1
as	1
others.	1
	1
2:4	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
rich	1
in	1
mercy,	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
2:5	1
Even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
sins,	1
hath	1
quickened	1
us	1
together	1
with	1
Christ,	1
(by	1
grace	1
ye	1
are	1
saved;)	1
2:6	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
sit	1
together	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:7	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
ages	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
might	1
shew	1
the	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
kindness	1
toward	1
us	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
by	1
grace	1
are	1
ye	1
saved	1
through	1
faith;	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
of	1
yourselves:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God:	1
2:9	1
Not	1
of	1
works,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
boast.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
workmanship,	1
created	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
before	1
ordained	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
2:11	1
Wherefore	1
remember,	1
that	1
ye	1
being	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
Uncircumcision	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Circumcision	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
made	1
by	1
hands;	1
2:12	1
That	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
ye	1
were	1
without	1
Christ,	1
being	1
aliens	1
from	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
strangers	1
from	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
promise,	1
having	1
no	1
hope,	1
and	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
2:13	1
But	1
now	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
ye	1
who	1
sometimes	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
are	1
made	1
nigh	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
peace,	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
both	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
middle	1
wall	1
of	1
partition	1
between	1
us;	1
2:15	1
Having	1
abolished	1
in	1
his	1
flesh	1
the	1
enmity,	1
even	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
commandments	1
contained	1
in	1
ordinances;	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
himself	1
of	1
twain	1
one	1
new	1
man,	1
so	1
making	1
peace;	1
2:16	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reconcile	1
both	1
unto	1
God	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
cross,	1
having	1
slain	1
the	1
enmity	1
thereby:	1
2:17	1
And	1
came	1
and	1
preached	1
peace	1
to	1
you	1
which	1
were	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
nigh.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
through	1
him	1
we	1
both	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
strangers	1
and	1
foreigners,	1
but	1
fellowcitizens	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
God;	1
2:20	1
And	1
are	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone;	1
2:21	1
In	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
building	1
fitly	1
framed	1
together	1
groweth	1
unto	1
an	1
holy	1
temple	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
2:22	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
builded	1
together	1
for	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:1	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
Paul,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
3:2	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
you-ward:	1
3:3	1
How	1
that	1
by	1
revelation	1
he	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
mystery;	1
(as	1
I	1
wrote	1
afore	1
in	1
few	1
words,	1
3:4	1
Whereby,	1
when	1
ye	1
read,	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
my	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ)	1
3:5	1
Which	1
in	1
other	1
ages	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
revealed	1
unto	1
his	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
3:6	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
should	1
be	1
fellowheirs,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
body,	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
in	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
gospel:	1
3:7	1
Whereof	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:8	1
Unto	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
saints,	1
is	1
this	1
grace	1
given,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
unsearchable	1
riches	1
of	1
Christ;	1
3:9	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
men	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
in	1
God,	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:10	1
To	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
manifold	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
3:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
which	1
he	1
purposed	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord:	1
3:12	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
boldness	1
and	1
access	1
with	1
confidence	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:13	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
faint	1
not	1
at	1
my	1
tribulations	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
bow	1
my	1
knees	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
3:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
named,	1
3:16	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
to	1
be	1
strengthened	1
with	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
man;	1
3:17	1
That	1
Christ	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith;	1
that	1
ye,	1
being	1
rooted	1
and	1
grounded	1
in	1
love,	1
3:18	1
May	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comprehend	1
with	1
all	1
saints	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth,	1
and	1
length,	1
and	1
depth,	1
and	1
height;	1
3:19	1
And	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ,	1
which	1
passeth	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
exceeding	1
abundantly	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
ask	1
or	1
think,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
throughout	1
all	1
ages,	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
therefore,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
vocation	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
are	1
called,	1
4:2	1
With	1
all	1
lowliness	1
and	1
meekness,	1
with	1
longsuffering,	1
forbearing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
love;	1
4:3	1
Endeavouring	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
4:4	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
one	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
hope	1
of	1
your	1
calling;	1
4:5	1
One	1
Lord,	1
one	1
faith,	1
one	1
baptism,	1
4:6	1
One	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
is	1
above	1
all,	1
and	1
through	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
given	1
grace	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
When	1
he	1
ascended	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
he	1
led	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
and	1
gave	1
gifts	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
4:9	1
(Now	1
that	1
he	1
ascended,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
descended	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:10	1
He	1
that	1
descended	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
also	1
that	1
ascended	1
up	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
heavens,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fill	1
all	1
things.)	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
some,	1
apostles;	1
and	1
some,	1
prophets;	1
and	1
some,	1
evangelists;	1
and	1
some,	1
pastors	1
and	1
teachers;	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
perfecting	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ministry,	1
for	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:13	1
Till	1
we	1
all	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
stature	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:14	1
That	1
we	1
henceforth	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
children,	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
wind	1
of	1
doctrine,	1
by	1
the	1
sleight	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
cunning	1
craftiness,	1
whereby	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
to	1
deceive;	1
4:15	1
But	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
love,	1
may	1
grow	1
up	1
into	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head,	1
even	1
Christ:	1
4:16	1
From	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
fitly	1
joined	1
together	1
and	1
compacted	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
joint	1
supplieth,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
every	1
part,	1
maketh	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
unto	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
therefore,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
henceforth	1
walk	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
Gentiles	1
walk,	1
in	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
their	1
mind,	1
4:18	1
Having	1
the	1
understanding	1
darkened,	1
being	1
alienated	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
ignorance	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
heart:	1
4:19	1
Who	1
being	1
past	1
feeling	1
have	1
given	1
themselves	1
over	1
unto	1
lasciviousness,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
greediness.	1
	1
4:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
learned	1
Christ;	1
4:21	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
in	1
Jesus:	1
4:22	1
That	1
ye	1
put	1
off	1
concerning	1
the	1
former	1
conversation	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
corrupt	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deceitful	1
lusts;	1
4:23	1
And	1
be	1
renewed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
your	1
mind;	1
4:24	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
after	1
God	1
is	1
created	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
true	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:25	1
Wherefore	1
putting	1
away	1
lying,	1
speak	1
every	1
man	1
truth	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
4:26	1
Be	1
ye	1
angry,	1
and	1
sin	1
not:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
your	1
wrath:	1
4:27	1
Neither	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:28	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
stole	1
steal	1
no	1
more:	1
but	1
rather	1
let	1
him	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
needeth.	1
	1
4:29	1
Let	1
no	1
corrupt	1
communication	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
edifying,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
minister	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
grieve	1
not	1
the	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
are	1
sealed	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
redemption.	1
	1
4:31	1
Let	1
all	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
wrath,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
clamour,	1
and	1
evil	1
speaking,	1
be	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
with	1
all	1
malice:	1
4:32	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
kind	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
tenderhearted,	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
God	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
hath	1
forgiven	1
you.	1
	1
5:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
followers	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
dear	1
children;	1
5:2	1
And	1
walk	1
in	1
love,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
himself	1
for	1
us	1
an	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
sweetsmelling	1
savour.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
fornication,	1
and	1
all	1
uncleanness,	1
or	1
covetousness,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
once	1
named	1
among	1
you,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints;	1
5:4	1
Neither	1
filthiness,	1
nor	1
foolish	1
talking,	1
nor	1
jesting,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient:	1
but	1
rather	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
this	1
ye	1
know,	1
that	1
no	1
whoremonger,	1
nor	1
unclean	1
person,	1
nor	1
covetous	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
idolater,	1
hath	1
any	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:6	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
with	1
vain	1
words:	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
cometh	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
partakers	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
sometimes	1
darkness,	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
walk	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
light:	1
5:9	1
(For	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
goodness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
and	1
truth;)	1
5:10	1
Proving	1
what	1
is	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
fellowship	1
with	1
the	1
unfruitful	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
but	1
rather	1
reprove	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
even	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
reproved	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
light:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
doth	1
make	1
manifest	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
Awake	1
thou	1
that	1
sleepest,	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
Christ	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
then	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
circumspectly,	1
not	1
as	1
fools,	1
but	1
as	1
wise,	1
5:16	1
Redeeming	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
5:17	1
Wherefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
unwise,	1
but	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
drunk	1
with	1
wine,	1
wherein	1
is	1
excess;	1
but	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
5:19	1
Speaking	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
and	1
making	1
melody	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
5:20	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
always	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
5:21	1
Submitting	1
yourselves	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:23	1
For	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wife,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
church:	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
saviour	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
subject	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
wives	1
be	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands	1
in	1
every	1
thing.	1
	1
5:25	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
loved	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
it;	1
5:26	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
water	1
by	1
the	1
word,	1
5:27	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
glorious	1
church,	1
not	1
having	1
spot,	1
or	1
wrinkle,	1
or	1
any	1
such	1
thing;	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
5:28	1
So	1
ought	1
men	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
wives	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
bodies.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
wife	1
loveth	1
himself.	1
	1
5:29	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
ever	1
yet	1
hated	1
his	1
own	1
flesh;	1
but	1
nourisheth	1
and	1
cherisheth	1
it,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
church:	1
5:30	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
5:31	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:32	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery:	1
but	1
I	1
speak	1
concerning	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
5:33	1
Nevertheless	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
particular	1
so	1
love	1
his	1
wife	1
even	1
as	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
reverence	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
6:1	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
right.	1
	1
6:2	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother;	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
with	1
promise;	1
6:3	1
That	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
And,	1
ye	1
fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
wrath:	1
but	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
nurture	1
and	1
admonition	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:5	1
Servants,	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling,	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
as	1
unto	1
Christ;	1
6:6	1
Not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Christ,	1
doing	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
6:7	1
With	1
good	1
will	1
doing	1
service,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
men:	1
6:8	1
Knowing	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
good	1
thing	1
any	1
man	1
doeth,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free.	1
	1
6:9	1
And,	1
ye	1
masters,	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
forbearing	1
threatening:	1
knowing	1
that	1
your	1
Master	1
also	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
might.	1
	1
6:11	1
Put	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
we	1
wrestle	1
not	1
against	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
but	1
against	1
principalities,	1
against	1
powers,	1
against	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
against	1
spiritual	1
wickedness	1
in	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
6:13	1
Wherefore	1
take	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
all,	1
to	1
stand.	1
	1
6:14	1
Stand	1
therefore,	1
having	1
your	1
loins	1
girt	1
about	1
with	1
truth,	1
and	1
having	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
6:15	1
And	1
your	1
feet	1
shod	1
with	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace;	1
6:16	1
Above	1
all,	1
taking	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
faith,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
quench	1
all	1
the	1
fiery	1
darts	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
6:18	1
Praying	1
always	1
with	1
all	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
watching	1
thereunto	1
with	1
all	1
perseverance	1
and	1
supplication	1
for	1
all	1
saints;	1
6:19	1
And	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
utterance	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
boldly,	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
6:20	1
For	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
ambassador	1
in	1
bonds:	1
that	1
therein	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
boldly,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
6:21	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
know	1
my	1
affairs,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
do,	1
Tychicus,	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother	1
and	1
faithful	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
things:	1
6:22	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
our	1
affairs,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
6:23	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
faith,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:24	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
sincerity.	1
	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Philippians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
with	1
the	1
bishops	1
and	1
deacons:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
upon	1
every	1
remembrance	1
of	1
you,	1
1:4	1
Always	1
in	1
every	1
prayer	1
of	1
mine	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
making	1
request	1
with	1
joy,	1
1:5	1
For	1
your	1
fellowship	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
now;	1
1:6	1
Being	1
confident	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
begun	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
perform	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
heart;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
both	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
and	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
my	1
grace.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
record,	1
how	1
greatly	1
I	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
pray,	1
that	1
your	1
love	1
may	1
abound	1
yet	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
knowledge	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
judgment;	1
1:10	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
approve	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
excellent;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
without	1
offence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
are	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
ye	1
should	1
understand,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
unto	1
me	1
have	1
fallen	1
out	1
rather	1
unto	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:13	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
bonds	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
places;	1
1:14	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
waxing	1
confident	1
by	1
my	1
bonds,	1
are	1
much	1
more	1
bold	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
without	1
fear.	1
	1
1:15	1
Some	1
indeed	1
preach	1
Christ	1
even	1
of	1
envy	1
and	1
strife;	1
and	1
some	1
also	1
of	1
good	1
will:	1
1:16	1
The	1
one	1
preach	1
Christ	1
of	1
contention,	1
not	1
sincerely,	1
supposing	1
to	1
add	1
affliction	1
to	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
love,	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:18	1
What	1
then?	1
notwithstanding,	1
every	1
way,	1
whether	1
in	1
pretence,	1
or	1
in	1
truth,	1
Christ	1
is	1
preached;	1
and	1
I	1
therein	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
yea,	1
and	1
will	1
rejoice.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
salvation	1
through	1
your	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:20	1
According	1
to	1
my	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
and	1
my	1
hope,	1
that	1
in	1
nothing	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness,	1
as	1
always,	1
so	1
now	1
also	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
magnified	1
in	1
my	1
body,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
life,	1
or	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
is	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
is	1
gain.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
labour:	1
yet	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
I	1
wot	1
not.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
betwixt	1
two,	1
having	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
depart,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Christ;	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
better:	1
1:24	1
Nevertheless	1
to	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
more	1
needful	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
having	1
this	1
confidence,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
abide	1
and	1
continue	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
furtherance	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
faith;	1
1:26	1
That	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
abundant	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
1:27	1
Only	1
let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
becometh	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
that	1
whether	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you,	1
or	1
else	1
be	1
absent,	1
I	1
may	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
affairs,	1
that	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
one	1
spirit,	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
striving	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:28	1
And	1
in	1
nothing	1
terrified	1
by	1
your	1
adversaries:	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
evident	1
token	1
of	1
perdition,	1
but	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:29	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
behalf	1
of	1
Christ,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
believe	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
his	1
sake;	1
1:30	1
Having	1
the	1
same	1
conflict	1
which	1
ye	1
saw	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
now	1
hear	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
therefore	1
any	1
consolation	1
in	1
Christ,	1
if	1
any	1
comfort	1
of	1
love,	1
if	1
any	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
any	1
bowels	1
and	1
mercies,	1
2:2	1
Fulfil	1
ye	1
my	1
joy,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
likeminded,	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
love,	1
being	1
of	1
one	1
accord,	1
of	1
one	1
mind.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
nothing	1
be	1
done	1
through	1
strife	1
or	1
vainglory;	1
but	1
in	1
lowliness	1
of	1
mind	1
let	1
each	1
esteem	1
other	1
better	1
than	1
themselves.	1
	1
2:4	1
Look	1
not	1
every	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
things,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
others.	1
	1
2:5	1
Let	1
this	1
mind	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:6	1
Who,	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
God,	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
robbery	1
to	1
be	1
equal	1
with	1
God:	1
2:7	1
But	1
made	1
himself	1
of	1
no	1
reputation,	1
and	1
took	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men:	1
2:8	1
And	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
humbled	1
himself,	1
and	1
became	1
obedient	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
hath	1
highly	1
exalted	1
him,	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
every	1
name:	1
2:10	1
That	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
every	1
knee	1
should	1
bow,	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
and	1
things	1
under	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:11	1
And	1
that	1
every	1
tongue	1
should	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
Lord,	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:12	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
always	1
obeyed,	1
not	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
only,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
absence,	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure.	1
	1
2:14	1
Do	1
all	1
things	1
without	1
murmurings	1
and	1
disputings:	1
2:15	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
and	1
harmless,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
rebuke,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
perverse	1
nation,	1
among	1
whom	1
ye	1
shine	1
as	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
2:16	1
Holding	1
forth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
run	1
in	1
vain,	1
neither	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:17	1
Yea,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
I	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
also	1
do	1
ye	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
to	1
send	1
Timotheus	1
shortly	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
when	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
likeminded,	1
who	1
will	1
naturally	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
all	1
seek	1
their	1
own,	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Jesus	1
Christ's.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
him,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
father,	1
he	1
hath	1
served	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:23	1
Him	1
therefore	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
send	1
presently,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
myself	1
shall	1
come	1
shortly.	1
	1
2:25	1
Yet	1
I	1
supposed	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
Epaphroditus,	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
labour,	1
and	1
fellowsoldier,	1
but	1
your	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
ministered	1
to	1
my	1
wants.	1
	1
2:26	1
For	1
he	1
longed	1
after	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
heaviness,	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
2:27	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death:	1
but	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
only,	1
but	1
on	1
me	1
also,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
upon	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:28	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
more	1
carefully,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
again,	1
ye	1
may	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
sorrowful.	1
	1
2:29	1
Receive	1
him	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
gladness;	1
and	1
hold	1
such	1
in	1
reputation:	1
2:30	1
Because	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Christ	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death,	1
not	1
regarding	1
his	1
life,	1
to	1
supply	1
your	1
lack	1
of	1
service	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
To	1
write	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
me	1
indeed	1
is	1
not	1
grievous,	1
but	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
safe.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beware	1
of	1
dogs,	1
beware	1
of	1
evil	1
workers,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
concision.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:4	1
Though	1
I	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
If	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
he	1
might	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
more:	1
3:5	1
Circumcised	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
law,	1
a	1
Pharisee;	1
3:6	1
Concerning	1
zeal,	1
persecuting	1
the	1
church;	1
touching	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
gain	1
to	1
me,	1
those	1
I	1
counted	1
loss	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:8	1
Yea	1
doubtless,	1
and	1
I	1
count	1
all	1
things	1
but	1
loss	1
for	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
my	1
Lord:	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
do	1
count	1
them	1
but	1
dung,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
win	1
Christ,	1
3:9	1
And	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
not	1
having	1
mine	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith:	1
3:10	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
being	1
made	1
conformable	1
unto	1
his	1
death;	1
3:11	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
might	1
attain	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
attained,	1
either	1
were	1
already	1
perfect:	1
but	1
I	1
follow	1
after,	1
if	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
apprehend	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
apprehended	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:13	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
count	1
not	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
apprehended:	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
do,	1
forgetting	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
behind,	1
and	1
reaching	1
forth	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
before,	1
3:14	1
I	1
press	1
toward	1
the	1
mark	1
for	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:15	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
thus	1
minded:	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
ye	1
be	1
otherwise	1
minded,	1
God	1
shall	1
reveal	1
even	1
this	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless,	1
whereto	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
attained,	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rule,	1
let	1
us	1
mind	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
	1
3:17	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
followers	1
together	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
walk	1
so	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
ensample.	1
	1
3:18	1
(For	1
many	1
walk,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
often,	1
and	1
now	1
tell	1
you	1
even	1
weeping,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ:	1
3:19	1
Whose	1
end	1
is	1
destruction,	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
their	1
belly,	1
and	1
whose	1
glory	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
shame,	1
who	1
mind	1
earthly	1
things.)	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
our	1
conversation	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Saviour,	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:21	1
Who	1
shall	1
change	1
our	1
vile	1
body,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fashioned	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
glorious	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
whereby	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
even	1
to	1
subdue	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
brethren	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
and	1
longed	1
for,	1
my	1
joy	1
and	1
crown,	1
so	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
beseech	1
Euodias,	1
and	1
beseech	1
Syntyche,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
I	1
intreat	1
thee	1
also,	1
true	1
yokefellow,	1
help	1
those	1
women	1
which	1
laboured	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel,	1
with	1
Clement	1
also,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
my	1
fellowlabourers,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:4	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
alway:	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say,	1
Rejoice.	1
	1
4:5	1
Let	1
your	1
moderation	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:6	1
Be	1
careful	1
for	1
nothing;	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
let	1
your	1
requests	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
passeth	1
all	1
understanding,	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
minds	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:8	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
true,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
honest,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
just,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
pure,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
lovely,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
good	1
report;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
virtue,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
praise,	1
think	1
on	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
4:9	1
Those	1
things,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
both	1
learned,	1
and	1
received,	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
me,	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
But	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
greatly,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
your	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
hath	1
flourished	1
again;	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
also	1
careful,	1
but	1
ye	1
lacked	1
opportunity.	1
	1
4:11	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
want:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned,	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
state	1
I	1
am,	1
therewith	1
to	1
be	1
content.	1
	1
4:12	1
I	1
know	1
both	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
abased,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
abound:	1
every	1
where	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
instructed	1
both	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
hungry,	1
both	1
to	1
abound	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
need.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
through	1
Christ	1
which	1
strengtheneth	1
me.	1
	1
4:14	1
Notwithstanding	1
ye	1
have	1
well	1
done,	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
communicate	1
with	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
ye	1
Philippians	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
when	1
I	1
departed	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
no	1
church	1
communicated	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
concerning	1
giving	1
and	1
receiving,	1
but	1
ye	1
only.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
even	1
in	1
Thessalonica	1
ye	1
sent	1
once	1
and	1
again	1
unto	1
my	1
necessity.	1
	1
4:17	1
Not	1
because	1
I	1
desire	1
a	1
gift:	1
but	1
I	1
desire	1
fruit	1
that	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
your	1
account.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
all,	1
and	1
abound:	1
I	1
am	1
full,	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
Epaphroditus	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
you,	1
an	1
odour	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
smell,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
acceptable,	1
wellpleasing	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
supply	1
all	1
your	1
need	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
riches	1
in	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:21	1
Salute	1
every	1
saint	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
The	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:22	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you,	1
chiefly	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
Caesar's	1
household.	1
	1
4:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

	1
Paul,	1

by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1

	1
To	1
the	1

faithful	1

Grace	1

God	1
our	1

	1

	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
praying	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
1:4	1
	1
Since	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:5	1
	1
For	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
heaven,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
heard	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:6	1
	1
Which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
as	1
it	1
doth	1
also	1
in	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
also	1
learned	1
of	1
Epaphras	1
our	1
dear	1
fellowservant,	1
who	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
of	1
Christ;	1
1:8	1
	1
Who	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
your	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:9	1
	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
we	1
also,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
do	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
spiritual	1
understanding;	1
1:10	1
	1
That	1
ye	1
might	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
all	1
pleasing,	1
being	1
fruitful	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
and	1
increasing	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God;	1
1:11	1
	1
Strengthened	1
with	1
all	1
might,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
glorious	1
power,	1
unto	1
all	1
patience	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
with	1
joyfulness;	1
1:12	1
	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
light:	1
1:13	1
	1
Who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
translated	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
Son:	1
1:14	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
even	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
1:15	1
	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
invisible	1
God,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
every	1
creature:	1
1:16	1
	1
For	1
by	1
him	1
were	1
all	1
things	1
created,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
earth,	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
thrones,	1
or	1
dominions,	1
or	1
principalities,	1
or	1
powers:	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
created	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
him:	1
1:17	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
consist.	1
	1
1:18	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
the	1
church:	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence.	1
	1
1:19	1
	1
For	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
all	1
fulness	1
dwell;	1
1:20	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
cross,	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
reconcile	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself;	1
by	1
him,	1
I	1
say,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
or	1
things	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
that	1
were	1
sometime	1
alienated	1
and	1
enemies	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
by	1
wicked	1
works,	1
yet	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
reconciled	1
1:22	1
	1
In	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
through	1
death,	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
holy	1
and	1
unblameable	1
and	1
unreproveable	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
1:23	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
grounded	1
and	1
settled,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
under	1
heaven;	1
whereof	1
I	1
Paul	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister;	1
1:24	1
	1
Who	1
now	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
sufferings	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
fill	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
behind	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
for	1
his	1
body's	1
sake,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church:	1
1:25	1
	1
Whereof	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God;	1
1:26	1
	1
Even	1
the	1
mystery	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
from	1
ages	1
and	1
from	1
generations,	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
his	1
saints:	1
1:27	1
	1
To	1
whom	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
mystery	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:28	1
	1
Whom	1
we	1
preach,	1
warning	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
teaching	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
present	1
every	1
man	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
1:29	1
	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
also	1
labour,	1
striving	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
working,	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
me	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:1	1
	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
knew	1
what	1
great	1
conflict	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
my	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
flesh;	1
2:2	1
	1
That	1
their	1
hearts	1
might	1
be	1
comforted,	1
being	1
knit	1
together	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
understanding,	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:3	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
are	1
hid	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
	1
2:4	1
	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
beguile	1
you	1
with	1
enticing	1
words.	1
	1
2:5	1
	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
absent	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
joying	1
and	1
beholding	1
your	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
stedfastness	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
have	1
therefore	1
received	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord,	1
so	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
him:	1
2:7	1
	1
Rooted	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
stablished	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
abounding	1
therein	1
with	1
thanksgiving.	1
	1
2:8	1
	1
Beware	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
spoil	1
you	1
through	1
philosophy	1
and	1
vain	1
deceit,	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
after	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:9	1
	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
dwelleth	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Godhead	1
bodily.	1
	1
2:10	1
	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
him,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
principality	1
and	1
power:	1
2:11	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
circumcision	1
made	1
without	1
hands,	1
in	1
putting	1
off	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
by	1
the	1
circumcision	1
of	1
Christ:	1
2:12	1
	1
Buried	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
baptism,	1
wherein	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
2:13	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
being	1
dead	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
forgiven	1
you	1
all	1
trespasses;	1
2:14	1
	1
Blotting	1
out	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
ordinances	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
us,	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
nailing	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
cross;	1
2:15	1
	1
And	1
having	1
spoiled	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
them	1
openly,	1
triumphing	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
meat,	1
or	1
in	1
drink,	1
or	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
an	1
holyday,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days:	1
2:17	1
	1
Which	1
are	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
but	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:18	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
beguile	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
a	1
voluntary	1
humility	1
and	1
worshipping	1
of	1
angels,	1
intruding	1
into	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
vainly	1
puffed	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
fleshly	1
mind,	1
2:19	1
	1
And	1
not	1
holding	1
the	1
Head,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
joints	1
and	1
bands	1
having	1
nourishment	1
ministered,	1
and	1
knit	1
together,	1
increaseth	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
why,	1
as	1
though	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
are	1
ye	1
subject	1
to	1
ordinances,	1
2:21	1
	1
(Touch	1
not;	1
taste	1
not;	1
handle	1
not;	1
2:22	1
	1
Which	1
all	1
are	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
using;)	1
after	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
men?	1
2:23	1
	1
Which	1
things	1
have	1
indeed	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
wisdom	1
in	1
will	1
worship,	1
and	1
humility,	1
and	1
neglecting	1
of	1
the	1
body:	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
satisfying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:1	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
risen	1
with	1
Christ,	1
seek	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
above,	1
where	1
Christ	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:2	1
	1
Set	1
your	1
affection	1
on	1
things	1
above,	1
not	1
on	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:3	1
	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
hid	1
with	1
Christ	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
	1
When	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
our	1
life,	1
shall	1
appear,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
also	1
appear	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:5	1
	1
Mortify	1
therefore	1
your	1
members	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
inordinate	1
affection,	1
evil	1
concupiscence,	1
and	1
covetousness,	1
which	1
is	1
idolatry:	1
3:6	1
	1
For	1
which	1
things'	1
sake	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
on	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
3:7	1
	1
In	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
walked	1
some	1
time,	1
when	1
ye	1
lived	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:8	1
	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
also	1
put	1
off	1
all	1
these;	1
anger,	1
wrath,	1
malice,	1
blasphemy,	1
filthy	1
communication	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:9	1
	1
Lie	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
deeds;	1
3:10	1
	1
And	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
renewed	1
in	1
knowledge	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
created	1
him:	1
3:11	1
	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
Greek	1
nor	1
Jew,	1
circumcision	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
Barbarian,	1
Scythian,	1
bond	1
nor	1
free:	1
but	1
Christ	1
is	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
3:12	1
	1
Put	1
on	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
elect	1
of	1
God,	1
holy	1
and	1
beloved,	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercies,	1
kindness,	1
humbleness	1
of	1
mind,	1
meekness,	1
longsuffering;	1
3:13	1
	1
Forbearing	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
any:	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
forgave	1
you,	1
so	1
also	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
3:14	1
	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
on	1
charity,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
perfectness.	1
	1
3:15	1
	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
rule	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
to	1
the	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
body;	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
thankful.	1
	1
3:16	1
	1
Let	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
dwell	1
in	1
you	1
richly	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
teaching	1
and	1
admonishing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
with	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:17	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
deed,	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:19	1
	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
bitter	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
3:20	1
	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
all	1
things:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
well	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:21	1
	1
Fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
anger,	1
lest	1
they	1
be	1
discouraged.	1
	1
3:22	1
	1
Servants,	1
obey	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
fearing	1
God;	1
3:23	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
it	1
heartily,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
men;	1
3:24	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance:	1
for	1
ye	1
serve	1
the	1
Lord	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:25	1
	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
wrong	1
shall	1
receive	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
4:1	1
	1
Masters,	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
servants	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
equal;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
a	1
Master	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
4:2	1
	1
Continue	1
in	1
prayer,	1
and	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
thanksgiving;	1
4:3	1
	1
Withal	1
praying	1
also	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
open	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
utterance,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
in	1
bonds:	1
4:4	1
	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
manifest,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
4:5	1
	1
Walk	1
in	1
wisdom	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
redeeming	1
the	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
	1
Let	1
your	1
speech	1
be	1
alway	1
with	1
grace,	1
seasoned	1
with	1
salt,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
answer	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
4:7	1
	1
All	1
my	1
state	1
shall	1
Tychicus	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
and	1
fellowservant	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
4:8	1
	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
your	1
estate,	1
and	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts;	1
4:9	1
	1
With	1
Onesimus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you.	1
They	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
here.	1
	1
4:10	1
	1
Aristarchus	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Marcus,	1
sister's	1
son	1
to	1
Barnabas,	1
(touching	1
whom	1
ye	1
received	1
commandments:	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
receive	1
him;)	1
4:11	1
	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Justus,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
These	1
only	1
are	1
my	1
fellowworkers	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
comfort	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:12	1
	1
Epaphras,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ,	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
always	1
labouring	1
fervently	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
prayers,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
stand	1
perfect	1
and	1
complete	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
him	1
record,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
great	1
zeal	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
them	1
in	1
Hierapolis.	1
	1
4:14	1
	1
Luke,	1
the	1
beloved	1
physician,	1
and	1
Demas,	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
	1
Salute	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
Nymphas,	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
4:16	1
	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
epistle	1
is	1
read	1
among	1
you,	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
read	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
likewise	1
read	1
the	1
epistle	1
from	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
4:17	1
	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
Archippus,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
thou	1
fulfil	1
it.	1
	1
4:18	1
	1
The	1
salutation	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
Paul.	1
Remember	1
my	1
bonds.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:2	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
our	1
prayers;	1
1:3	1
Remembering	1
without	1
ceasing	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
faith,	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father;	1
1:4	1
Knowing,	1
brethren	1
beloved,	1
your	1
election	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
our	1
gospel	1
came	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
word	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
assurance;	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
we	1
were	1
among	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
sake.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
ye	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
much	1
affliction,	1
with	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
ensamples	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
from	1
you	1
sounded	1
out	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
your	1
faith	1
to	1
God-ward	1
is	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
they	1
themselves	1
shew	1
of	1
us	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
entering	1
in	1
we	1
had	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
ye	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
idols	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
true	1
God;	1
1:10	1
And	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
Son	1
from	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
2:1	1
For	1
yourselves,	1
brethren,	1
know	1
our	1
entrance	1
in	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain:	1
2:2	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
before,	1
and	1
were	1
shamefully	1
entreated,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
we	1
were	1
bold	1
in	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
much	1
contention.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
our	1
exhortation	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
deceit,	1
nor	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
nor	1
in	1
guile:	1
2:4	1
But	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
allowed	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
trust	1
with	1
the	1
gospel,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
speak;	1
not	1
as	1
pleasing	1
men,	1
but	1
God,	1
which	1
trieth	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
used	1
we	1
flattering	1
words,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
nor	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
covetousness;	1
God	1
is	1
witness:	1
2:6	1
Nor	1
of	1
men	1
sought	1
we	1
glory,	1
neither	1
of	1
you,	1
nor	1
yet	1
of	1
others,	1
when	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
burdensome,	1
as	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
gentle	1
among	1
you,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
cherisheth	1
her	1
children:	1
2:8	1
So	1
being	1
affectionately	1
desirous	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
imparted	1
unto	1
you,	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
our	1
own	1
souls,	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
dear	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
ye	1
remember,	1
brethren,	1
our	1
labour	1
and	1
travail:	1
for	1
labouring	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
God	1
also,	1
how	1
holily	1
and	1
justly	1
and	1
unblameably	1
we	1
behaved	1
ourselves	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
believe:	1
2:11	1
As	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
exhorted	1
and	1
comforted	1
and	1
charged	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
doth	1
his	1
children,	1
2:12	1
That	1
ye	1
would	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
unto	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
also	1
thank	1
we	1
God	1
without	1
ceasing,	1
because,	1
when	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
ye	1
received	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
truth,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
effectually	1
worketh	1
also	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
in	1
Judaea	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
for	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
suffered	1
like	1
things	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
2:15	1
Who	1
both	1
killed	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
prophets,	1
and	1
have	1
persecuted	1
us;	1
and	1
they	1
please	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
men:	1
2:16	1
Forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved,	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
their	1
sins	1
alway:	1
for	1
the	1
wrath	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
presence,	1
not	1
in	1
heart,	1
endeavoured	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
face	1
with	1
great	1
desire.	1
	1
2:18	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
even	1
I	1
Paul,	1
once	1
and	1
again;	1
but	1
Satan	1
hindered	1
us.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
hope,	1
or	1
joy,	1
or	1
crown	1
of	1
rejoicing?	1
Are	1
not	1
even	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
at	1
his	1
coming?	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
our	1
glory	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
we	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
Athens	1
alone;	1
3:2	1
And	1
sent	1
Timotheus,	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
fellowlabourer	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
to	1
establish	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:3	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
moved	1
by	1
these	1
afflictions:	1
for	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
appointed	1
thereunto.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
verily,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
we	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
suffer	1
tribulation;	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause,	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
faith,	1
lest	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
the	1
tempter	1
have	1
tempted	1
you,	1
and	1
our	1
labour	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:6	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
Timotheus	1
came	1
from	1
you	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
good	1
remembrance	1
of	1
us	1
always,	1
desiring	1
greatly	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
to	1
see	1
you:	1
3:7	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
affliction	1
and	1
distress	1
by	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:8	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
live,	1
if	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
what	1
thanks	1
can	1
we	1
render	1
to	1
God	1
again	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
wherewith	1
we	1
joy	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
before	1
our	1
God;	1
3:10	1
Night	1
and	1
day	1
praying	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
see	1
your	1
face,	1
and	1
might	1
perfect	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lacking	1
in	1
your	1
faith?	1
	1
3:11	1
Now	1
God	1
himself	1
and	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
direct	1
our	1
way	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
increase	1
and	1
abound	1
in	1
love	1
one	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
men,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
toward	1
you:	1
3:13	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
may	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts	1
unblameable	1
in	1
holiness	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
4:1	1
Furthermore	1
then	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
us	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
God,	1
so	1
ye	1
would	1
abound	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
commandments	1
we	1
gave	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
your	1
sanctification,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
abstain	1
from	1
fornication:	1
4:4	1
That	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
possess	1
his	1
vessel	1
in	1
sanctification	1
and	1
honour;	1
4:5	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
concupiscence,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
know	1
not	1
God:	1
4:6	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
beyond	1
and	1
defraud	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
any	1
matter:	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
all	1
such,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
have	1
forewarned	1
you	1
and	1
testified.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
uncleanness,	1
but	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
despiseth,	1
despiseth	1
not	1
man,	1
but	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
also	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
brotherly	1
love	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
taught	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
indeed	1
ye	1
do	1
it	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Macedonia:	1
but	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
increase	1
more	1
and	1
more;	1
4:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
study	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
hands,	1
as	1
we	1
commanded	1
you;	1
4:12	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
honestly	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
lack	1
of	1
nothing.	1
	1
4:13	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
concerning	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrow	1
not,	1
even	1
as	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
hope.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
died	1
and	1
rose	1
again,	1
even	1
so	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
sleep	1
in	1
Jesus	1
will	1
God	1
bring	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
this	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
not	1
prevent	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
descend	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
archangel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
trump	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
rise	1
first:	1
4:17	1
Then	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
shall	1
be	1
caught	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
ever	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:18	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
perfectly	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
so	1
cometh	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Peace	1
and	1
safety;	1
then	1
sudden	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them,	1
as	1
travail	1
upon	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
that	1
day	1
should	1
overtake	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
nor	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
sleep,	1
as	1
do	1
others;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
watch	1
and	1
be	1
sober.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
sleep	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
drunken	1
are	1
drunken	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
let	1
us,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
be	1
sober,	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
love;	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
helmet,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
appointed	1
us	1
to	1
wrath,	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
salvation	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:10	1
Who	1
died	1
for	1
us,	1
that,	1
whether	1
we	1
wake	1
or	1
sleep,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
together	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
edify	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
to	1
know	1
them	1
which	1
labour	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
are	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
admonish	1
you;	1
5:13	1
And	1
to	1
esteem	1
them	1
very	1
highly	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
their	1
work's	1
sake.	1
And	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:14	1
Now	1
we	1
exhort	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
warn	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
unruly,	1
comfort	1
the	1
feebleminded,	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
be	1
patient	1
toward	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
that	1
none	1
render	1
evil	1
for	1
evil	1
unto	1
any	1
man;	1
but	1
ever	1
follow	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
both	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:16	1
Rejoice	1
evermore.	1
	1
5:17	1
Pray	1
without	1
ceasing.	1
	1
5:18	1
In	1
every	1
thing	1
give	1
thanks:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
Quench	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:20	1
Despise	1
not	1
prophesyings.	1
	1
5:21	1
Prove	1
all	1
things;	1
hold	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1

	1
5:22	1
Abstain	1
from	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
sanctify	1
you	1
wholly;	1
and	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
your	1
whole	1
spirit	1
and	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
be	1
preserved	1
blameless	1
unto	1
the	1

	1
5:24	1
Faithful	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
you,	1
who	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
5:25	1
Brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:26	1
Greet	1
all	1
the	1

with	1
an	1
holy	1

	1
5:27	1
I	1
charge	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
this	1
epistle	1
be	1

	1
5:28	1
The	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
in	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
We	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet,	1
because	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
groweth	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
all	1
toward	1
each	1
other	1
aboundeth;	1
1:4	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
glory	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
patience	1
and	1
faith	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
persecutions	1
and	1
tribulations	1
that	1
ye	1
endure:	1
1:5	1
Which	1
is	1
a	1
manifest	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
suffer:	1
1:6	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
thing	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
recompense	1
tribulation	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
you;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
troubled	1
rest	1
with	1
us,	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
angels,	1
1:8	1
In	1
flaming	1
fire	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:9	1
Who	1
shall	1
be	1
punished	1
with	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
power;	1
1:10	1
When	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1
in	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
(because	1
our	1
testimony	1
among	1
you	1
was	1
believed)	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:11	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
we	1
pray	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
would	1
count	1
you	1
worthy	1
of	1
this	1
calling,	1
and	1
fulfil	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
faith	1
with	1
power:	1
1:12	1
That	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
gathering	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
2:2	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
soon	1
shaken	1
in	1
mind,	1
or	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
by	1
spirit,	1
nor	1
by	1
word,	1
nor	1
by	1
letter	1
as	1
from	1
us,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
means:	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
not	1
come,	1
except	1
there	1
come	1
a	1
falling	1
away	1
first,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
of	1
sin	1
be	1
revealed,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
opposeth	1
and	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
God,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
worshipped;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
as	1
God	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
shewing	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
withholdeth	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
iniquity	1
doth	1
already	1
work:	1
only	1
he	1
who	1
now	1
letteth	1
will	1
let,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
that	1
Wicked	1
be	1
revealed,	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
consume	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
with	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
coming:	1
2:9	1
Even	1
him,	1
whose	1
coming	1
is	1
after	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
Satan	1
with	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
signs	1
and	1
lying	1
wonders,	1
2:10	1
And	1
with	1
all	1
deceivableness	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish;	1
because	1
they	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
strong	1
delusion,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
a	1
lie:	1
2:12	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
might	1
be	1
damned	1
who	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
had	1
pleasure	1
in	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
2:13	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
alway	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren	1
beloved	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
chosen	1
you	1
to	1
salvation	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
truth:	1
2:14	1
Whereunto	1
he	1
called	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
gospel,	1
to	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:15	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
stand	1
fast,	1
and	1
hold	1
the	1
traditions	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
whether	1
by	1
word,	1
or	1
our	1
epistle.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself,	1
and	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
everlasting	1
consolation	1
and	1
good	1
hope	1
through	1
grace,	1
2:17	1
Comfort	1
your	1
hearts,	1
and	1
stablish	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
word	1
and	1
work.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
may	1
have	1
free	1
course,	1
and	1
be	1
glorified,	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
you:	1
3:2	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
unreasonable	1
and	1
wicked	1
men:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
faith.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
shall	1
stablish	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
touching	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
both	1
do	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
direct	1
your	1
hearts	1
into	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
patient	1
waiting	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:6	1
Now	1
we	1
command	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
withdraw	1
yourselves	1
from	1
every	1
brother	1
that	1
walketh	1
disorderly,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
behaved	1
not	1
ourselves	1
disorderly	1
among	1
you;	1
3:8	1
Neither	1
did	1
we	1
eat	1
any	1
man's	1
bread	1
for	1
nought;	1
but	1
wrought	1
with	1
labour	1
and	1
travail	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
you:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
power,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
ourselves	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
us.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
this	1
we	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
would	1
not	1
work,	1
neither	1
should	1
he	1
eat.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
we	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
walk	1
among	1
you	1
disorderly,	1
working	1
not	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
are	1
busybodies.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
we	1
command	1
and	1
exhort	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
with	1
quietness	1
they	1
work,	1
and	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
bread.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
obey	1
not	1
our	1
word	1
by	1
this	1
epistle,	1
note	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:15	1
Yet	1
count	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
enemy,	1
but	1
admonish	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
peace	1
himself	1
give	1
you	1
peace	1
always	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
The	1
Lord	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
in	1
every	1
epistle:	1
so	1
I	1
write.	1
	1
3:18	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
and	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
hope;	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
As	1
I	1
besought	1
thee	1
to	1
abide	1
still	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
charge	1
some	1
that	1
they	1
teach	1
no	1
other	1
doctrine,	1
1:4	1
Neither	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
fables	1
and	1
endless	1
genealogies,	1
which	1
minister	1
questions,	1
rather	1
than	1
godly	1
edifying	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
faith:	1
so	1
do.	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
is	1
charity	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
unfeigned:	1
1:6	1
From	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
swerved	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
unto	1
vain	1
jangling;	1
1:7	1
Desiring	1
to	1
be	1
teachers	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
understanding	1
neither	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
nor	1
whereof	1
they	1
affirm.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
good,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
use	1
it	1
lawfully;	1
1:9	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
lawless	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
for	1
sinners,	1
for	1
unholy	1
and	1
profane,	1
for	1
murderers	1
of	1
fathers	1
and	1
murderers	1
of	1
mothers,	1
for	1
manslayers,	1
1:10	1
For	1
whoremongers,	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
defile	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
for	1
menstealers,	1
for	1
liars,	1
for	1
perjured	1
persons,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
1:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
God,	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
trust.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
thank	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
enabled	1
me,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
counted	1
me	1
faithful,	1
putting	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
ministry;	1
1:13	1
Who	1
was	1
before	1
a	1
blasphemer,	1
and	1
a	1
persecutor,	1
and	1
injurious:	1
but	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
ignorantly	1
in	1
unbelief.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
exceeding	1
abundant	1
with	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation,	1
that	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
save	1
sinners;	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
chief.	1
	1
1:16	1
Howbeit	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
first	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
longsuffering,	1
for	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
should	1
hereafter	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
unto	1
the	1
King	1
eternal,	1
immortal,	1
invisible,	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God,	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:18	1
This	1
charge	1
I	1
commit	1
unto	1
thee,	1
son	1
Timothy,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
on	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
by	1
them	1
mightest	1
war	1
a	1
good	1
warfare;	1
1:19	1
Holding	1
faith,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
put	1
away	1
concerning	1
faith	1
have	1
made	1
shipwreck:	1
1:20	1
Of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Alexander;	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
not	1
to	1
blaspheme.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
exhort	1
therefore,	1
that,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
supplications,	1
prayers,	1
intercessions,	1
and	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
all	1
men;	1
2:2	1
For	1
kings,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
authority;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
lead	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
peaceable	1
life	1
in	1
all	1
godliness	1
and	1
honesty.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
will	1
have	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
and	1
one	1
mediator	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
men,	1
the	1
man	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
all,	1
to	1
be	1
testified	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
ordained	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
lie	1
not;)	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
verity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
men	1
pray	1
every	1
where,	1
lifting	1
up	1
holy	1
hands,	1
without	1
wrath	1
and	1
doubting.	1
	1
2:9	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
also,	1
that	1
women	1
adorn	1
themselves	1
in	1
modest	1
apparel,	1
with	1
shamefacedness	1
and	1
sobriety;	1
not	1
with	1
broided	1
hair,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
pearls,	1
or	1
costly	1
array;	1
2:10	1
But	1
(which	1
becometh	1
women	1
professing	1
godliness)	1
with	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:11	1
Let	1
the	1
woman	1
learn	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
all	1
subjection.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
I	1
suffer	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
teach,	1
nor	1
to	1
usurp	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
man,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
Adam	1
was	1
first	1
formed,	1
then	1
Eve.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Adam	1
was	1
not	1
deceived,	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
being	1
deceived	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
transgression.	1
	1
2:15	1
Notwithstanding	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
childbearing,	1
if	1
they	1
continue	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
charity	1
and	1
holiness	1
with	1
sobriety.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
desire	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
bishop,	1
he	1
desireth	1
a	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
3:2	1
A	1
bishop	1
then	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
vigilant,	1
sober,	1
of	1
good	1
behaviour,	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach;	1
3:3	1
Not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
but	1
patient,	1
not	1
a	1
brawler,	1
not	1
covetous;	1
3:4	1
One	1
that	1
ruleth	1
well	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
having	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
subjection	1
with	1
all	1
gravity;	1
3:5	1
(For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
rule	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God?)	1
	1
3:6	1
Not	1
a	1
novice,	1
lest	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:7	1
Moreover	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
without;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
reproach	1
and	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:8	1
Likewise	1
must	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
doubletongued,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
3:9	1
Holding	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
pure	1
conscience.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
let	1
these	1
also	1
first	1
be	1
proved;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
use	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon,	1
being	1
found	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:11	1
Even	1
so	1
must	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
slanderers,	1
sober,	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
ruling	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
well.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon	1
well	1
purchase	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
degree,	1
and	1
great	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:14	1
These	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hoping	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
shortly:	1
3:15	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
tarry	1
long,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
behave	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
pillar	1
and	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
without	1
controversy	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
godliness:	1
God	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
seen	1
of	1
angels,	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
believed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
glory.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Spirit	1
speaketh	1
expressly,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
times	1
some	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
seducing	1
spirits,	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
devils;	1
4:2	1
Speaking	1
lies	1
in	1
hypocrisy;	1
having	1
their	1
conscience	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
hot	1
iron;	1
4:3	1
Forbidding	1
to	1
marry,	1
and	1
commanding	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
created	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving:	1
4:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:6	1
If	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
doctrine,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
hast	1
attained.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
refuse	1
profane	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
fables,	1
and	1
exercise	1
thyself	1
rather	1
unto	1
godliness.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
profiteth	1
little:	1
but	1
godliness	1
is	1
profitable	1
unto	1
all	1
things,	1
having	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
therefore	1
we	1
both	1
labour	1
and	1
suffer	1
reproach,	1
because	1
we	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
specially	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
4:11	1
These	1
things	1
command	1
and	1
teach.	1
	1
4:12	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thy	1
youth;	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
believers,	1
in	1
word,	1
in	1
conversation,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
spirit,	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
purity.	1
	1
4:13	1
Till	1
I	1
come,	1
give	1
attendance	1
to	1
reading,	1
to	1
exhortation,	1
to	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:14	1
Neglect	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
thee	1
by	1
prophecy,	1
with	1
the	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
presbytery.	1
	1
4:15	1
Meditate	1
upon	1
these	1
things;	1
give	1
thyself	1
wholly	1
to	1
them;	1
that	1
thy	1
profiting	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
Take	1
heed	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
doctrine;	1
continue	1
in	1
them:	1
for	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
5:1	1
Rebuke	1
not	1
an	1
elder,	1
but	1
intreat	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
father;	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
as	1
brethren;	1
5:2	1
The	1
elder	1
women	1
as	1
mothers;	1
the	1
younger	1
as	1
sisters,	1
with	1
all	1
purity.	1
	1
5:3	1
Honour	1
widows	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
widow	1
have	1
children	1
or	1
nephews,	1
let	1
them	1
learn	1
first	1
to	1
shew	1
piety	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
to	1
requite	1
their	1
parents:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
widow	1
indeed,	1
and	1
desolate,	1
trusteth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
continueth	1
in	1
supplications	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
she	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
pleasure	1
is	1
dead	1
while	1
she	1
liveth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
give	1
in	1
charge,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
provide	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
specially	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
he	1
hath	1
denied	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
infidel.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
not	1
a	1
widow	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
number	1
under	1
threescore	1
years	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
5:10	1
Well	1
reported	1
of	1
for	1
good	1
works;	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
brought	1
up	1
children,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
lodged	1
strangers,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
washed	1
the	1
saints'	1
feet,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
relieved	1
the	1
afflicted,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
diligently	1
followed	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
the	1
younger	1
widows	1
refuse:	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
wax	1
wanton	1
against	1
Christ,	1
they	1
will	1
marry;	1
5:12	1
Having	1
damnation,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
first	1
faith.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
withal	1
they	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
wandering	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
idle,	1
but	1
tattlers	1
also	1
and	1
busybodies,	1
speaking	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not.	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
marry,	1
bear	1
children,	1
guide	1
the	1
house,	1
give	1
none	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
adversary	1
to	1
speak	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
5:15	1
For	1
some	1
are	1
already	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
Satan.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
believeth	1
have	1
widows,	1
let	1
them	1
relieve	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
church	1
be	1
charged;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
relieve	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:17	1
Let	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
rule	1
well	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
double	1
honour,	1
especially	1
they	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
And,	1
The	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
5:19	1
Against	1
an	1
elder	1
receive	1
not	1
an	1
accusation,	1
but	1
before	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses.	1
	1
5:20	1
Them	1
that	1
sin	1
rebuke	1
before	1
all,	1
that	1
others	1
also	1
may	1
fear.	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
elect	1
angels,	1
that	1
thou	1
observe	1
these	1
things	1
without	1
preferring	1
one	1
before	1
another,	1
doing	1
nothing	1
by	1
partiality.	1
	1
5:22	1
Lay	1
hands	1
suddenly	1
on	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
sins:	1
keep	1
thyself	1
pure.	1
	1
5:23	1
Drink	1
no	1
longer	1
water,	1
but	1
use	1
a	1
little	1
wine	1
for	1
thy	1
stomach's	1
sake	1
and	1
thine	1
often	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:24	1
Some	1
men's	1
sins	1
are	1
open	1
beforehand,	1
going	1
before	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
some	1
men	1
they	1
follow	1
after.	1
	1
5:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
good	1
works	1
of	1
some	1
are	1
manifest	1
beforehand;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
otherwise	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
6:1	1
Let	1
as	1
many	1
servants	1
as	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
count	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
honour,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
doctrine	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
believing	1
masters,	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
despise	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
brethren;	1
but	1
rather	1
do	1
them	1
service,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
benefit.	1
These	1
things	1
teach	1
and	1
exhort.	1
	1
6:3	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
consent	1
not	1
to	1
wholesome	1
words,	1
even	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
godliness;	1
6:4	1
He	1
is	1
proud,	1
knowing	1
nothing,	1
but	1
doting	1
about	1
questions	1
and	1
strifes	1
of	1
words,	1
whereof	1
cometh	1
envy,	1
strife,	1
railings,	1
evil	1
surmisings,	1
6:5	1
Perverse	1
disputings	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
supposing	1
that	1
gain	1
is	1
godliness:	1
from	1
such	1
withdraw	1
thyself.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
godliness	1
with	1
contentment	1
is	1
great	1
gain.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
we	1
brought	1
nothing	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
we	1
can	1
carry	1
nothing	1
out.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
having	1
food	1
and	1
raiment	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
therewith	1
content.	1
	1
6:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
rich	1
fall	1
into	1
temptation	1
and	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
into	1
many	1
foolish	1
and	1
hurtful	1
lusts,	1
which	1
drown	1
men	1
in	1
destruction	1
and	1
perdition.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil:	1
which	1
while	1
some	1
coveted	1
after,	1
they	1
have	1
erred	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
pierced	1
themselves	1
through	1
with	1
many	1
sorrows.	1
	1
6:11	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
flee	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
godliness,	1
faith,	1
love,	1
patience,	1
meekness.	1
	1
6:12	1
Fight	1
the	1
good	1
fight	1
of	1
faith,	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
art	1
also	1
called,	1
and	1
hast	1
professed	1
a	1
good	1
profession	1
before	1
many	1
witnesses.	1
	1
6:13	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
before	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
before	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
witnessed	1
a	1
good	1
confession;	1
6:14	1
That	1
thou	1
keep	1
this	1
commandment	1
without	1
spot,	1
unrebukable,	1
until	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
6:15	1
Which	1
in	1
his	1
times	1
he	1
shall	1
shew,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
blessed	1
and	1
only	1
Potentate,	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords;	1
6:16	1
Who	1
only	1
hath	1
immortality,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
approach	1
unto;	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
seen,	1
nor	1
can	1
see:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
power	1
everlasting.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:17	1
Charge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
rich	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
nor	1
trust	1
in	1
uncertain	1
riches,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
giveth	1
us	1
richly	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
enjoy;	1
6:18	1
That	1
they	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
rich	1
in	1
good	1
works,	1
ready	1
to	1
distribute,	1
willing	1
to	1
communicate;	1
6:19	1
Laying	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
foundation	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:20	1
O	1
Timothy,	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
thy	1
trust,	1
avoiding	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings,	1
and	1
oppositions	1
of	1
science	1
falsely	1
so	1
called:	1
6:21	1
Which	1
some	1
professing	1
have	1
erred	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
1:2	1
To	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
son:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
God,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
from	1
my	1
forefathers	1
with	1
pure	1
conscience,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
have	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day;	1
1:4	1
Greatly	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
being	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy;	1
1:5	1
When	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
unfeigned	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
first	1
in	1
thy	1
grandmother	1
Lois,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
Eunice;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
in	1
thee	1
also.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
remembrance	1
that	1
thou	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
fear;	1
but	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
mind.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
therefore	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
of	1
me	1
his	1
prisoner:	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God;	1
1:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
saved	1
us,	1
and	1
called	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
calling,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
works,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
purpose	1
and	1
grace,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
1:10	1
But	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
abolished	1
death,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
life	1
and	1
immortality	1
to	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:11	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
appointed	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
which	1
cause	1
I	1
also	1
suffer	1
these	1
things:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
believed,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:13	1
Hold	1
fast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
sound	1
words,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:14	1
That	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
thee	1
keep	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
Phygellus	1
and	1
Hermogenes.	1
	1
1:16	1
The	1
Lord	1
give	1
mercy	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Onesiphorus;	1
for	1
he	1
oft	1
refreshed	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
my	1
chain:	1
1:17	1
But,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Rome,	1
he	1
sought	1
me	1
out	1
very	1
diligently,	1
and	1
found	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
The	1
Lord	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
in	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
very	1
well.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me	1
among	1
many	1
witnesses,	1
the	1
same	1
commit	1
thou	1
to	1
faithful	1
men,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
teach	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
2:3	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
endure	1
hardness,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:4	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
warreth	1
entangleth	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
life;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
strive	1
for	1
masteries,	1
yet	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
crowned,	1
except	1
he	1
strive	1
lawfully.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
husbandman	1
that	1
laboureth	1
must	1
be	1
first	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
fruits.	1
	1
2:7	1
Consider	1
what	1
I	1
say;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
thee	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:8	1
Remember	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
was	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel:	1
2:9	1
Wherein	1
I	1
suffer	1
trouble,	1
as	1
an	1
evil	1
doer,	1
even	1
unto	1
bonds;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
bound.	1
	1
2:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
endure	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sakes,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
also	1
obtain	1
the	1
salvation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
with	1
eternal	1
glory.	1
	1
2:11	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying:	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
him,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
2:12	1
If	1
we	1
suffer,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
reign	1
with	1
him:	1
if	1
we	1
deny	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
will	1
deny	1
us:	1
2:13	1
If	1
we	1
believe	1
not,	1
yet	1
he	1
abideth	1
faithful:	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
himself.	1
	1
2:14	1
Of	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
charging	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
strive	1
not	1
about	1
words	1
to	1
no	1
profit,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
subverting	1
of	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
2:15	1
Study	1
to	1
shew	1
thyself	1
approved	1
unto	1
God,	1
a	1
workman	1
that	1
needeth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
rightly	1
dividing	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
shun	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
increase	1
unto	1
more	1
ungodliness.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
their	1
word	1
will	1
eat	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
canker:	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Philetus;	1
2:18	1
Who	1
concerning	1
the	1
truth	1
have	1
erred,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
resurrection	1
is	1
past	1
already;	1
and	1
overthrow	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
some.	1
	1
2:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
God	1
standeth	1
sure,	1
having	1
this	1
seal,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
his.	1
And,	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
nameth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
depart	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
house	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
earth;	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
dishonour.	1
	1
2:21	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
therefore	1
purge	1
himself	1
from	1
these,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
master's	1
use,	1
and	1
prepared	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
2:22	1
Flee	1
also	1
youthful	1
lusts:	1
but	1
follow	1
righteousness,	1
faith,	1
charity,	1
peace,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart.	1
	1
2:23	1
But	1
foolish	1
and	1
unlearned	1
questions	1
avoid,	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
gender	1
strifes.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
must	1
not	1
strive;	1
but	1
be	1
gentle	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach,	1
patient,	1
2:25	1
In	1
meekness	1
instructing	1
those	1
that	1
oppose	1
themselves;	1
if	1
God	1
peradventure	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
2:26	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
recover	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
are	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
perilous	1
times	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
lovers	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
selves,	1
covetous,	1
boasters,	1
proud,	1
blasphemers,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
unthankful,	1
unholy,	1
3:3	1
Without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
trucebreakers,	1
false	1
accusers,	1
incontinent,	1
fierce,	1
despisers	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
good,	1
3:4	1
Traitors,	1
heady,	1
highminded,	1
lovers	1
of	1
pleasures	1
more	1
than	1
lovers	1
of	1
God;	1
3:5	1
Having	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
godliness,	1
but	1
denying	1
the	1
power	1
thereof:	1
from	1
such	1
turn	1
away.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
creep	1
into	1
houses,	1
and	1
lead	1
captive	1
silly	1
women	1
laden	1
with	1
sins,	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
divers	1
lusts,	1
3:7	1
Ever	1
learning,	1
and	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
as	1
Jannes	1
and	1
Jambres	1
withstood	1
Moses,	1
so	1
do	1
these	1
also	1
resist	1
the	1
truth:	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
reprobate	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
proceed	1
no	1
further:	1
for	1
their	1
folly	1
shall	1
be	1
manifest	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
their's	1
also	1
was.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
fully	1
known	1
my	1
doctrine,	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
purpose,	1
faith,	1
longsuffering,	1
charity,	1
patience,	1
3:11	1
Persecutions,	1
afflictions,	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Antioch,	1
at	1
Iconium,	1
at	1
Lystra;	1
what	1
persecutions	1
I	1
endured:	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
me.	1
	1
3:12	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
live	1
godly	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
suffer	1
persecution.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
evil	1
men	1
and	1
seducers	1
shall	1
wax	1
worse	1
and	1
worse,	1
deceiving,	1
and	1
being	1
deceived.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
continue	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
assured	1
of,	1
knowing	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
them;	1
3:15	1
And	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
thou	1
hast	1
known	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,	1
which	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
wise	1
unto	1
salvation	1
through	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:16	1
All	1
scripture	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
inspiration	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
doctrine,	1
for	1
reproof,	1
for	1
correction,	1
for	1
instruction	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
3:17	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
perfect,	1
throughly	1
furnished	1
unto	1
all	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
therefore	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
appearing	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom;	1
4:2	1
Preach	1
the	1
word;	1
be	1
instant	1
in	1
season,	1
out	1
of	1
season;	1
reprove,	1
rebuke,	1
exhort	1
with	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
endure	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
but	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts	1
shall	1
they	1
heap	1
to	1
themselves	1
teachers,	1
having	1
itching	1
ears;	1
4:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
fables.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
watch	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
endure	1
afflictions,	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
evangelist,	1
make	1
full	1
proof	1
of	1
thy	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
offered,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:7	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
a	1
good	1
fight,	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
my	1
course,	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
faith:	1
4:8	1
Henceforth	1
there	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
righteous	1
judge,	1
shall	1
give	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
only,	1
but	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
love	1
his	1
appearing.	1
	1
4:9	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
shortly	1
unto	1
me:	1
4:10	1
For	1
Demas	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
having	1
loved	1
this	1
present	1
world,	1
and	1
is	1
departed	1
unto	1
Thessalonica;	1
Crescens	1
to	1
Galatia,	1
Titus	1
unto	1
Dalmatia.	1
	1
4:11	1
Only	1
Luke	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
Take	1
Mark,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
profitable	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Tychicus	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
4:13	1
The	1
cloke	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Troas	1
with	1
Carpus,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest,	1
bring	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
books,	1
but	1
especially	1
the	1
parchments.	1
	1
4:14	1
Alexander	1
the	1
coppersmith	1
did	1
me	1
much	1
evil:	1
the	1
Lord	1
reward	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works:	1
4:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
be	1
thou	1
ware	1
also;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
greatly	1
withstood	1
our	1
words.	1
	1
4:16	1
At	1
my	1
first	1
answer	1
no	1
man	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
men	1
forsook	1
me:	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
4:17	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
me;	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
the	1
preaching	1
might	1
be	1
fully	1
known,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
hear:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
every	1
evil	1
work,	1
and	1
will	1
preserve	1
me	1
unto	1
his	1
heavenly	1
kingdom:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:19	1
Salute	1
Prisca	1
and	1
Aquila,	1
and	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Onesiphorus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Erastus	1
abode	1
at	1
Corinth:	1
but	1
Trophimus	1
have	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Miletum	1
sick.	1
	1
4:21	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
winter.	1
Eubulus	1
greeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
Pudens,	1
and	1
Linus,	1
and	1
Claudia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
4:22	1
The	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
spirit.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Titus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God's	1
elect,	1
and	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
after	1
godliness;	1
1:2	1
In	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
God,	1
that	1
cannot	1
lie,	1
promised	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began;	1
1:3	1
But	1
hath	1
in	1
due	1
times	1
manifested	1
his	1
word	1
through	1
preaching,	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
1:4	1
To	1
Titus,	1
mine	1
own	1
son	1
after	1
the	1
common	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
left	1
I	1
thee	1
in	1
Crete,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
wanting,	1
and	1
ordain	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
appointed	1
thee:	1
1:6	1
If	1
any	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
having	1
faithful	1
children	1
not	1
accused	1
of	1
riot	1
or	1
unruly.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
a	1
bishop	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
as	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
God;	1
not	1
selfwilled,	1
not	1
soon	1
angry,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
1:8	1
But	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
good	1
men,	1
sober,	1
just,	1
holy,	1
temperate;	1
1:9	1
Holding	1
fast	1
the	1
faithful	1
word	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
taught,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
by	1
sound	1
doctrine	1
both	1
to	1
exhort	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
gainsayers.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
unruly	1
and	1
vain	1
talkers	1
and	1
deceivers,	1
specially	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision:	1
1:11	1
Whose	1
mouths	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
who	1
subvert	1
whole	1
houses,	1
teaching	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not,	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre's	1
sake.	1
	1
1:12	1
One	1
of	1
themselves,	1
even	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
said,	1
The	1
Cretians	1
are	1
alway	1
liars,	1
evil	1
beasts,	1
slow	1
bellies.	1
	1
1:13	1
This	1
witness	1
is	1
true.	1
Wherefore	1
rebuke	1
them	1
sharply,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
1:14	1
Not	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
Jewish	1
fables,	1
and	1
commandments	1
of	1
men,	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
Unto	1
the	1
pure	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
pure:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
defiled	1
and	1
unbelieving	1
is	1
nothing	1
pure;	1
but	1
even	1
their	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
1:16	1
They	1
profess	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
God;	1
but	1
in	1
works	1
they	1
deny	1
him,	1
being	1
abominable,	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
reprobate.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
speak	1
thou	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
become	1
sound	1
doctrine:	1
2:2	1
That	1
the	1
aged	1
men	1
be	1
sober,	1
grave,	1
temperate,	1
sound	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
patience.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
aged	1
women	1
likewise,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
behaviour	1
as	1
becometh	1
holiness,	1
not	1
false	1
accusers,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
teachers	1
of	1
good	1
things;	1
2:4	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
young	1
women	1
to	1
be	1
sober,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
husbands,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
children,	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
discreet,	1
chaste,	1
keepers	1
at	1
home,	1
good,	1
obedient	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
2:6	1
Young	1
men	1
likewise	1
exhort	1
to	1
be	1
sober	1
minded.	1
	1
2:7	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
shewing	1
thyself	1
a	1
pattern	1
of	1
good	1
works:	1
in	1
doctrine	1
shewing	1
uncorruptness,	1
gravity,	1
sincerity,	1
2:8	1
Sound	1
speech,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
condemned;	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
part	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
having	1
no	1
evil	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
2:9	1
Exhort	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
masters,	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
well	1
in	1
all	1
things;	1
not	1
answering	1
again;	1
2:10	1
Not	1
purloining,	1
but	1
shewing	1
all	1
good	1
fidelity;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
adorn	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
bringeth	1
salvation	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
2:12	1
Teaching	1
us	1
that,	1
denying	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
worldly	1
lusts,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
soberly,	1
righteously,	1
and	1
godly,	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
world;	1
2:13	1
Looking	1
for	1
that	1
blessed	1
hope,	1
and	1
the	1
glorious	1
appearing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
2:14	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
redeem	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
purify	1
unto	1
himself	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people,	1
zealous	1
of	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:15	1
These	1
things	1
speak,	1
and	1
exhort,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
with	1
all	1
authority.	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thee.	1
	1
3:1	1
Put	1
them	1
in	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
to	1
obey	1
magistrates,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
3:2	1
To	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
brawlers,	1
but	1
gentle,	1
shewing	1
all	1
meekness	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
were	1
sometimes	1
foolish,	1
disobedient,	1
deceived,	1
serving	1
divers	1
lusts	1
and	1
pleasures,	1
living	1
in	1
malice	1
and	1
envy,	1
hateful,	1
and	1
hating	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:4	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
toward	1
man	1
appeared,	1
3:5	1
Not	1
by	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercy	1
he	1
saved	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
renewing	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost;	1
3:6	1
Which	1
he	1
shed	1
on	1
us	1
abundantly	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
3:7	1
That	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:8	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
affirm	1
constantly,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works.	1
These	1
things	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
profitable	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
avoid	1
foolish	1
questions,	1
and	1
genealogies,	1
and	1
contentions,	1
and	1
strivings	1
about	1
the	1
law;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
and	1
vain.	1
	1
3:10	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
heretick	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
admonition	1
reject;	1
3:11	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
such	1
is	1
subverted,	1
and	1
sinneth,	1
being	1
condemned	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
3:12	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
Artemas	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
Tychicus,	1
be	1
diligent	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
Nicopolis:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
there	1
to	1
winter.	1
	1
3:13	1
Bring	1
Zenas	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
Apollos	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
diligently,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
wanting	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
let	1
our's	1
also	1
learn	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works	1
for	1
necessary	1
uses,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
3:15	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
Philemon	1
our	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
and	1
fellowlabourer,	1
1:2	1
And	1
to	1
our	1
beloved	1
Apphia,	1
and	1
Archippus	1
our	1
fellowsoldier,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
thy	1
house:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1

	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
thee	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers,	1
1:5	1
Hearing	1
of	1
thy	1
love	1
and	1
faith,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
toward	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
saints;	1
1:6	1
That	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
may	1
become	1
effectual	1
by	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
consolation	1
in	1
thy	1
love,	1
because	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
are	1
refreshed	1
by	1
thee,	1
brother.	1
	1
1:8	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
much	1
bold	1
in	1
Christ	1
to	1
enjoin	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
convenient,	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
for	1
love's	1
sake	1
I	1
rather	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
being	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
Paul	1
the	1
aged,	1
and	1
now	1
also	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
Onesimus,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
in	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:11	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
was	1
to	1
thee	1
unprofitable,	1
but	1
now	1
profitable	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
me:	1
1:12	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
again:	1
thou	1
therefore	1
receive	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
mine	1
own	1
bowels:	1
1:13	1
Whom	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
retained	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
thy	1
stead	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:14	1
But	1
without	1
thy	1
mind	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
nothing;	1
that	1
thy	1
benefit	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
willingly.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
perhaps	1
he	1
therefore	1
departed	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
receive	1
him	1
for	1
ever;	1
1:16	1
Not	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
above	1
a	1
servant,	1
a	1
brother	1
beloved,	1
specially	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
unto	1
thee,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
1:17	1
If	1
thou	1
count	1
me	1
therefore	1
a	1
partner,	1
receive	1
him	1
as	1
myself.	1
	1
1:18	1
If	1
he	1
hath	1
wronged	1
thee,	1
or	1
oweth	1
thee	1
ought,	1
put	1
that	1
on	1
mine	1
account;	1
1:19	1
I	1
Paul	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
it:	1
albeit	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
thee	1
how	1
thou	1
owest	1
unto	1
me	1
even	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
besides.	1
	1
1:20	1
Yea,	1
brother,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
joy	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
refresh	1
my	1
bowels	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:21	1
Having	1
confidence	1
in	1
thy	1
obedience	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
thee,	1
knowing	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
also	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
withal	1
prepare	1
me	1
also	1
a	1
lodging:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
prayers	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:23	1
There	1
salute	1
thee	1
Epaphras,	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
1:24	1
Marcus,	1
Aristarchus,	1
Demas,	1
Lucas,	1
my	1
fellowlabourers.	1
	1
1:25	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
God,	1
who	1
at	1
sundry	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
divers	1
manners	1
spake	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
1:2	1
Hath	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Son,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
heir	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
by	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
worlds;	1
1:3	1
Who	1
being	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
express	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
person,	1
and	1
upholding	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
himself	1
purged	1
our	1
sins,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
on	1
high:	1
1:4	1
Being	1
made	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
by	1
inheritance	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
name	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
unto	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee?	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
Son?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
bringeth	1
in	1
the	1
firstbegotten	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
And	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
he	1
saith,	1
Who	1
maketh	1
his	1
angels	1
spirits,	1
and	1
his	1
ministers	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
he	1
saith,	1
Thy	1
throne,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
a	1
sceptre	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
hated	1
iniquity;	1
therefore	1
God,	1
even	1
thy	1
God,	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
gladness	1
above	1
thy	1
fellows.	1
	1
1:10	1
And,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
hast	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
hands:	1
1:11	1
They	1
shall	1
perish;	1
but	1
thou	1
remainest;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
garment;	1
1:12	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
vesture	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fold	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
changed:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
shall	1
not	1
fail.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
until	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
1:14	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
ministering	1
spirits,	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
minister	1
for	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
heirs	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
more	1
earnest	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
we	1
should	1
let	1
them	1
slip.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
spoken	1
by	1
angels	1
was	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
every	1
transgression	1
and	1
disobedience	1
received	1
a	1
just	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward;	1
2:3	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
neglect	1
so	1
great	1
salvation;	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
was	1
confirmed	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
him;	1
2:4	1
God	1
also	1
bearing	1
them	1
witness,	1
both	1
with	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
with	1
divers	1
miracles,	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will?	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
unto	1
the	1
angels	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
put	1
in	1
subjection	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
whereof	1
we	1
speak.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
testified,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
mindful	1
of	1
him?	1
or	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
visitest	1
him?	1
2:7	1
Thou	1
madest	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels;	1
thou	1
crownedst	1
him	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
didst	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands:	1
2:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
him,	1
he	1
left	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
not	1
yet	1
all	1
things	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
we	1
see	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels	1
for	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
death,	1
crowned	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour;	1
that	1
he	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
taste	1
death	1
for	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
it	1
became	1
him,	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
sons	1
unto	1
glory,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
salvation	1
perfect	1
through	1
sufferings.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
sanctified	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
one:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
brethren,	1
2:12	1
Saying,	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
And	1
again,	1
Behold	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me.	1
	1
2:14	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
he	1
also	1
himself	1
likewise	1
took	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
that	1
through	1
death	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
death,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
devil;	1
2:15	1
And	1
deliver	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
lifetime	1
subject	1
to	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
verily	1
he	1
took	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
angels;	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
it	1
behoved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
merciful	1
and	1
faithful	1
high	1
priest	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
suffered	1
being	1
tempted,	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
tempted.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore,	1
holy	1
brethren,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
calling,	1
consider	1
the	1
Apostle	1
and	1
High	1
Priest	1
of	1
our	1
profession,	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
3:2	1
Who	1
was	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
appointed	1
him,	1
as	1
also	1
Moses	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
more	1
glory	1
than	1
Moses,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
hath	1
builded	1
the	1
house	1
hath	1
more	1
honour	1
than	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
builded	1
by	1
some	1
man;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
built	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
verily	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
after;	1
3:6	1
But	1
Christ	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
whose	1
house	1
are	1
we,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
firm	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
3:7	1
Wherefore	1
(as	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
saith,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
3:8	1
Harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
temptation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
3:9	1
When	1
your	1
fathers	1
tempted	1
me,	1
proved	1
me,	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
works	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
3:10	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
was	1
grieved	1
with	1
that	1
generation,	1
and	1
said,	1
They	1
do	1
alway	1
err	1
in	1
their	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
3:11	1
So	1
I	1
sware	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.)	1
	1
3:12	1
Take	1
heed,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
an	1
evil	1
heart	1
of	1
unbelief,	1
in	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
exhort	1
one	1
another	1
daily,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
To	1
day;	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
hardened	1
through	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
confidence	1
stedfast	1
unto	1
the	1
end;	1
3:15	1
While	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
some,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard,	1
did	1
provoke:	1
howbeit	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
with	1
whom	1
was	1
he	1
grieved	1
forty	1
years?	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
sinned,	1
whose	1
carcases	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
to	1
whom	1
sware	1
he	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not?	1
	1
3:19	1
So	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
a	1
promise	1
being	1
left	1
us	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
preached	1
did	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
not	1
being	1
mixed	1
with	1
faith	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
do	1
enter	1
into	1
rest,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest:	1
although	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
finished	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
rest	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
again,	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.	1
	1
4:6	1
Seeing	1
therefore	1
it	1
remaineth	1
that	1
some	1
must	1
enter	1
therein,	1
and	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
first	1
preached	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief:	1
4:7	1
Again,	1
he	1
limiteth	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
saying	1
in	1
David,	1
To	1
day,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
if	1
Jesus	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
rest,	1
then	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
afterward	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
another	1
day.	1
	1
4:9	1
There	1
remaineth	1
therefore	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
works,	1
as	1
God	1
did	1
from	1
his.	1
	1
4:11	1
Let	1
us	1
labour	1
therefore	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
rest,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fall	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
example	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
quick,	1
and	1
powerful,	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
any	1
twoedged	1
sword,	1
piercing	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dividing	1
asunder	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
spirit,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
and	1
marrow,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
discerner	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:13	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
manifest	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
naked	1
and	1
opened	1
unto	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
4:14	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
high	1
priest,	1
that	1
is	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
heavens,	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
our	1
profession.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
our	1
infirmities;	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
tempted	1
like	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
yet	1
without	1
sin.	1
	1
4:16	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
come	1
boldly	1
unto	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
grace,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy,	1
and	1
find	1
grace	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
need.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
ordained	1
for	1
men	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
offer	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sins:	1
5:2	1
Who	1
can	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
also	1
is	1
compassed	1
with	1
infirmity.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
by	1
reason	1
hereof	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
also	1
for	1
himself,	1
to	1
offer	1
for	1
sins.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
this	1
honour	1
unto	1
himself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
was	1
Aaron.	1
	1
5:5	1
So	1
also	1
Christ	1
glorified	1
not	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
to	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
5:6	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:7	1
Who	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
up	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications	1
with	1
strong	1
crying	1
and	1
tears	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
feared;	1
5:8	1
Though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
Son,	1
yet	1
learned	1
he	1
obedience	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
suffered;	1
5:9	1
And	1
being	1
made	1
perfect,	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him;	1
5:10	1
Called	1
of	1
God	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:11	1
Of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
uttered,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
teachers,	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
that	1
one	1
teach	1
you	1
again	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
strong	1
meat.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
useth	1
milk	1
is	1
unskilful	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
babe.	1
	1
5:14	1
But	1
strong	1
meat	1
belongeth	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
full	1
age,	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
use	1
have	1
their	1
senses	1
exercised	1
to	1
discern	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
6:1	1
Therefore	1
leaving	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
unto	1
perfection;	1
not	1
laying	1
again	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
repentance	1
from	1
dead	1
works,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
toward	1
God,	1
6:2	1
Of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
baptisms,	1
and	1
of	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
hands,	1
and	1
of	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
judgment.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
if	1
God	1
permit.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
enlightened,	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift,	1
and	1
were	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
6:5	1
And	1
have	1
tasted	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
6:6	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
away,	1
to	1
renew	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
repentance;	1
seeing	1
they	1
crucify	1
to	1
themselves	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
afresh,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
shame.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
drinketh	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
that	1
cometh	1
oft	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
herbs	1
meet	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
dressed,	1
receiveth	1
blessing	1
from	1
God:	1
6:8	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
beareth	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers	1
is	1
rejected,	1
and	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
cursing;	1
whose	1
end	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
	1
6:9	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
we	1
are	1
persuaded	1
better	1
things	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
accompany	1
salvation,	1
though	1
we	1
thus	1
speak.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
unrighteous	1
to	1
forget	1
your	1
work	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
toward	1
his	1
name,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
do	1
minister.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
we	1
desire	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
same	1
diligence	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
hope	1
unto	1
the	1
end:	1
6:12	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
slothful,	1
but	1
followers	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
faith	1
and	1
patience	1
inherit	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
when	1
God	1
made	1
promise	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
by	1
no	1
greater,	1
he	1
sware	1
by	1
himself,	1
6:14	1
Saying,	1
Surely	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
patiently	1
endured,	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
men	1
verily	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
greater:	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
for	1
confirmation	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
strife.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherein	1
God,	1
willing	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
promise	1
the	1
immutability	1
of	1
his	1
counsel,	1
confirmed	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
oath:	1
6:18	1
That	1
by	1
two	1
immutable	1
things,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
God	1
to	1
lie,	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
consolation,	1
who	1
have	1
fled	1
for	1
refuge	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hope	1
set	1
before	1
us:	1
6:19	1
Which	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
both	1
sure	1
and	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
which	1
entereth	1
into	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
veil;	1
6:20	1
Whither	1
the	1
forerunner	1
is	1
for	1
us	1
entered,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:1	1
For	1
this	1
Melchisedec,	1
king	1
of	1
Salem,	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
who	1
met	1
Abraham	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
7:2	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
all;	1
first	1
being	1
by	1
interpretation	1
King	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
also	1
King	1
of	1
Salem,	1
which	1
is,	1
King	1
of	1
peace;	1
7:3	1
Without	1
father,	1
without	1
mother,	1
without	1
descent,	1
having	1
neither	1
beginning	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
end	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
abideth	1
a	1
priest	1
continually.	1
	1
7:4	1
Now	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
this	1
man	1
was,	1
unto	1
whom	1
even	1
the	1
patriarch	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
spoils.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
verily	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
who	1
receive	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
have	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
take	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
their	1
brethren,	1
though	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
7:6	1
But	1
he	1
whose	1
descent	1
is	1
not	1
counted	1
from	1
them	1
received	1
tithes	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
without	1
all	1
contradiction	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
better.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
here	1
men	1
that	1
die	1
receive	1
tithes;	1
but	1
there	1
he	1
receiveth	1
them,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
witnessed	1
that	1
he	1
liveth.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
say,	1
Levi	1
also,	1
who	1
receiveth	1
tithes,	1
payed	1
tithes	1
in	1
Abraham.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
when	1
Melchisedec	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
perfection	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
Levitical	1
priesthood,	1
(for	1
under	1
it	1
the	1
people	1
received	1
the	1
law,)	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
another	1
priest	1
should	1
rise	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Aaron?	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
the	1
priesthood	1
being	1
changed,	1
there	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
necessity	1
a	1
change	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
7:13	1
For	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
spoken	1
pertaineth	1
to	1
another	1
tribe,	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
attendance	1
at	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
our	1
Lord	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
Juda;	1
of	1
which	1
tribe	1
Moses	1
spake	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
far	1
more	1
evident:	1
for	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Melchisedec	1
there	1
ariseth	1
another	1
priest,	1
7:16	1
Who	1
is	1
made,	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
a	1
carnal	1
commandment,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
an	1
endless	1
life.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
he	1
testifieth,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
verily	1
a	1
disannulling	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
going	1
before	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
unprofitableness	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
made	1
nothing	1
perfect,	1
but	1
the	1
bringing	1
in	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
hope	1
did;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
we	1
draw	1
nigh	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
oath	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
priest:	1
7:21	1
(For	1
those	1
priests	1
were	1
made	1
without	1
an	1
oath;	1
but	1
this	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Lord	1
sware	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec:)	1
7:22	1
By	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
Jesus	1
made	1
a	1
surety	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
testament.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
they	1
truly	1
were	1
many	1
priests,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
suffered	1
to	1
continue	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
death:	1
7:24	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
continueth	1
ever,	1
hath	1
an	1
unchangeable	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:25	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
that	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
ever	1
liveth	1
to	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
7:26	1
For	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
became	1
us,	1
who	1
is	1
holy,	1
harmless,	1
undefiled,	1
separate	1
from	1
sinners,	1
and	1
made	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
heavens;	1
7:27	1
Who	1
needeth	1
not	1
daily,	1
as	1
those	1
high	1
priests,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
sacrifice,	1
first	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins,	1
and	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
people's:	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
once,	1
when	1
he	1
offered	1
up	1
himself.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
maketh	1
men	1
high	1
priests	1
which	1
have	1
infirmity;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
oath,	1
which	1
was	1
since	1
the	1
law,	1
maketh	1
the	1
Son,	1
who	1
is	1
consecrated	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sum:	1
We	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
8:2	1
A	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
tabernacle,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
pitched,	1
and	1
not	1
man.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
is	1
ordained	1
to	1
offer	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
have	1
somewhat	1
also	1
to	1
offer.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
on	1
earth,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
priest,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
priests	1
that	1
offer	1
gifts	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law:	1
8:5	1
Who	1
serve	1
unto	1
the	1
example	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things,	1
as	1
Moses	1
was	1
admonished	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
for,	1
See,	1
saith	1
he,	1
that	1
thou	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
pattern	1
shewed	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
ministry,	1
by	1
how	1
much	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
covenant,	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
upon	1
better	1
promises.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
been	1
faultless,	1
then	1
should	1
no	1
place	1
have	1
been	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
8:8	1
For	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
when	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
8:9	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
because	1
they	1
continued	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
I	1
regarded	1
them	1
not,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
mind,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
people:	1
8:11	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
teach	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
all	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
their	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
new	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
old.	1
Now	1
that	1
which	1
decayeth	1
and	1
waxeth	1
old	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
verily	1
the	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
also	1
ordinances	1
of	1
divine	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
worldly	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
made;	1
the	1
first,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
shewbread;	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
veil,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Holiest	1
of	1
all;	1
9:4	1
Which	1
had	1
the	1
golden	1
censer,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
overlaid	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
gold,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
golden	1
pot	1
that	1
had	1
manna,	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
that	1
budded,	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant;	1
9:5	1
And	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
cherubims	1
of	1
glory	1
shadowing	1
the	1
mercyseat;	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
now	1
speak	1
particularly.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
thus	1
ordained,	1
the	1
priests	1
went	1
always	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle,	1
accomplishing	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:7	1
But	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
went	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
alone	1
once	1
every	1
year,	1
not	1
without	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
9:8	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
this	1
signifying,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
manifest,	1
while	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
yet	1
standing:	1
9:9	1
Which	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
then	1
present,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
offered	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
service	1
perfect,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
conscience;	1
9:10	1
Which	1
stood	1
only	1
in	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks,	1
and	1
divers	1
washings,	1
and	1
carnal	1
ordinances,	1
imposed	1
on	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
reformation.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
Christ	1
being	1
come	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
perfect	1
tabernacle,	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
building;	1
9:12	1
Neither	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
calves,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
he	1
entered	1
in	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
having	1
obtained	1
eternal	1
redemption	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
an	1
heifer	1
sprinkling	1
the	1
unclean,	1
sanctifieth	1
to	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:14	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
through	1
the	1
eternal	1
Spirit	1
offered	1
himself	1
without	1
spot	1
to	1
God,	1
purge	1
your	1
conscience	1
from	1
dead	1
works	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
death,	1
for	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
transgressions	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
testament,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
eternal	1
inheritance.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
where	1
a	1
testament	1
is,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
testator.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
a	1
testament	1
is	1
of	1
force	1
after	1
men	1
are	1
dead:	1
otherwise	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
strength	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
testator	1
liveth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Whereupon	1
neither	1
the	1
first	1
testament	1
was	1
dedicated	1
without	1
blood.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
when	1
Moses	1
had	1
spoken	1
every	1
precept	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
calves	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
scarlet	1
wool,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
both	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
9:20	1
Saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
testament	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
enjoined	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:21	1
Moreover	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
blood	1
both	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
almost	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
purged	1
with	1
blood;	1
and	1
without	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
is	1
no	1
remission.	1
	1
9:23	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
patterns	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
should	1
be	1
purified	1
with	1
these;	1
but	1
the	1
heavenly	1
things	1
themselves	1
with	1
better	1
sacrifices	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
not	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
places	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
true;	1
but	1
into	1
heaven	1
itself,	1
now	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
us:	1
9:25	1
Nor	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
himself	1
often,	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
every	1
year	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
others;	1
9:26	1
For	1
then	1
must	1
he	1
often	1
have	1
suffered	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
now	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
once	1
to	1
die,	1
but	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
judgment:	1
9:28	1
So	1
Christ	1
was	1
once	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many;	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
shall	1
he	1
appear	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
without	1
sin	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:1	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
having	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
things,	1
can	1
never	1
with	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
which	1
they	1
offered	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
continually	1
make	1
the	1
comers	1
thereunto	1
perfect.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
then	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
offered?	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
worshippers	1
once	1
purged	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
conscience	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:3	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remembrance	1
again	1
made	1
of	1
sins	1
every	1
year.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
sins.	1
	1
10:5	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
but	1
a	1
body	1
hast	1
thou	1
prepared	1
me:	1
10:6	1
In	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
(in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
me,)	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
10:8	1
Above	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
neither	1
hadst	1
pleasure	1
therein;	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
10:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
He	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
10:10	1
By	1
the	1
which	1
will	1
we	1
are	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
once	1
for	1
all.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
every	1
priest	1
standeth	1
daily	1
ministering	1
and	1
offering	1
oftentimes	1
the	1
same	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
take	1
away	1
sins:	1
10:12	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
one	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins	1
for	1
ever,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
10:13	1
From	1
henceforth	1
expecting	1
till	1
his	1
enemies	1
be	1
made	1
his	1
footstool.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
offering	1
he	1
hath	1
perfected	1
for	1
ever	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
10:15	1
Whereof	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
10:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
them	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
hearts,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
will	1
I	1
write	1
them;	1
10:17	1
And	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:18	1
Now	1
where	1
remission	1
of	1
these	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
offering	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
10:19	1
Having	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
boldness	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
10:20	1
By	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
living	1
way,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
consecrated	1
for	1
us,	1
through	1
the	1
veil,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
flesh;	1
10:21	1
And	1
having	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
10:22	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
with	1
a	1
true	1
heart	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
faith,	1
having	1
our	1
hearts	1
sprinkled	1
from	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience,	1
and	1
our	1
bodies	1
washed	1
with	1
pure	1
water.	1
	1
10:23	1
Let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
our	1
faith	1
without	1
wavering;	1
(for	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
that	1
promised;)	1
10:24	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
provoke	1
unto	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
good	1
works:	1
10:25	1
Not	1
forsaking	1
the	1
assembling	1
of	1
ourselves	1
together,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
some	1
is;	1
but	1
exhorting	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
day	1
approaching.	1
	1
10:26	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
sin	1
wilfully	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
there	1
remaineth	1
no	1
more	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins,	1
10:27	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
fearful	1
looking	1
for	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
fiery	1
indignation,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
adversaries.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
that	1
despised	1
Moses'	1
law	1
died	1
without	1
mercy	1
under	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses:	1
10:29	1
Of	1
how	1
much	1
sorer	1
punishment,	1
suppose	1
ye,	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
thought	1
worthy,	1
who	1
hath	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
hath	1
counted	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified,	1
an	1
unholy	1
thing,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
despite	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
grace?	1
10:30	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
said,	1
Vengeance	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
10:31	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
fearful	1
thing	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
But	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
in	1
which,	1
after	1
ye	1
were	1
illuminated,	1
ye	1
endured	1
a	1
great	1
fight	1
of	1
afflictions;	1
10:33	1
Partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
a	1
gazingstock	1
both	1
by	1
reproaches	1
and	1
afflictions;	1
and	1
partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
became	1
companions	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
used.	1
	1
10:34	1
For	1
ye	1
had	1
compassion	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
took	1
joyfully	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
your	1
goods,	1
knowing	1
in	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
in	1
heaven	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
an	1
enduring	1
substance.	1
	1
10:35	1
Cast	1
not	1
away	1
therefore	1
your	1
confidence,	1
which	1
hath	1
great	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward.	1
	1
10:36	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
patience,	1
that,	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
10:37	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
will	1
come,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
draw	1
back,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
draw	1
back	1
unto	1
perdition;	1
but	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
faith	1
is	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
hoped	1
for,	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
elders	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report.	1
	1
11:3	1
Through	1
faith	1
we	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
worlds	1
were	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
that	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
were	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
do	1
appear.	1
	1
11:4	1
By	1
faith	1
Abel	1
offered	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
sacrifice	1
than	1
Cain,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
obtained	1
witness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
righteous,	1
God	1
testifying	1
of	1
his	1
gifts:	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
being	1
dead	1
yet	1
speaketh.	1
	1
11:5	1
By	1
faith	1
Enoch	1
was	1
translated	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
found,	1
because	1
God	1
had	1
translated	1
him:	1
for	1
before	1
his	1
translation	1
he	1
had	1
this	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
pleased	1
God.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
without	1
faith	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
please	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
God	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rewarder	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
diligently	1
seek	1
him.	1
	1
11:7	1
By	1
faith	1
Noah,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
yet,	1
moved	1
with	1
fear,	1
prepared	1
an	1
ark	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
condemned	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
became	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
11:8	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
after	1
receive	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
obeyed;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whither	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
11:9	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
country,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tabernacles	1
with	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
heirs	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
promise:	1
11:10	1
For	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
hath	1
foundations,	1
whose	1
builder	1
and	1
maker	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:11	1
Through	1
faith	1
also	1
Sara	1
herself	1
received	1
strength	1
to	1
conceive	1
seed,	1
and	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
past	1
age,	1
because	1
she	1
judged	1
him	1
faithful	1
who	1
had	1
promised.	1
	1
11:12	1
Therefore	1
sprang	1
there	1
even	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
dead,	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
innumerable.	1
	1
11:13	1
These	1
all	1
died	1
in	1
faith,	1
not	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
promises,	1
but	1
having	1
seen	1
them	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
were	1
persuaded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:14	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
declare	1
plainly	1
that	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
country.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
truly,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
opportunity	1
to	1
have	1
returned.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
desire	1
a	1
better	1
country,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
heavenly:	1
wherefore	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
city.	1
	1
11:17	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tried,	1
offered	1
up	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
promises	1
offered	1
up	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
son,	1
11:18	1
Of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
That	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called:	1
11:19	1
Accounting	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
he	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
figure.	1
	1
11:20	1
By	1
faith	1
Isaac	1
blessed	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Esau	1
concerning	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:21	1
By	1
faith	1
Jacob,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dying,	1
blessed	1
both	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
staff.	1
	1
11:22	1
By	1
faith	1
Joseph,	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
departing	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
11:23	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
was	1
hid	1
three	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
proper	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
	1
11:24	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
years,	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter;	1
11:25	1
Choosing	1
rather	1
to	1
suffer	1
affliction	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
than	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
sin	1
for	1
a	1
season;	1
11:26	1
Esteeming	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Christ	1
greater	1
riches	1
than	1
the	1
treasures	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
recompence	1
of	1
the	1
reward.	1
	1
11:27	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
forsook	1
Egypt,	1
not	1
fearing	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
endured,	1
as	1
seeing	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
invisible.	1
	1
11:28	1
Through	1
faith	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
blood,	1
lest	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
firstborn	1
should	1
touch	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
By	1
faith	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
as	1
by	1
dry	1
land:	1
which	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
assaying	1
to	1
do	1
were	1
drowned.	1
	1
11:30	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jericho	1
fell	1
down,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
compassed	1
about	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
11:31	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
harlot	1
Rahab	1
perished	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
spies	1
with	1
peace.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
more	1
say?	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
fail	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
Gedeon,	1
and	1
of	1
Barak,	1
and	1
of	1
Samson,	1
and	1
of	1
Jephthae;	1
of	1
David	1
also,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
prophets:	1
11:33	1
Who	1
through	1
faith	1
subdued	1
kingdoms,	1
wrought	1
righteousness,	1
obtained	1
promises,	1
stopped	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
11:34	1
Quenched	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
fire,	1
escaped	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
out	1
of	1
weakness	1
were	1
made	1
strong,	1
waxed	1
valiant	1
in	1
fight,	1
turned	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
aliens.	1
	1
11:35	1
Women	1
received	1
their	1
dead	1
raised	1
to	1
life	1
again:	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
tortured,	1
not	1
accepting	1
deliverance;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
better	1
resurrection:	1
11:36	1
And	1
others	1
had	1
trial	1
of	1
cruel	1
mockings	1
and	1
scourgings,	1
yea,	1
moreover	1
of	1
bonds	1
and	1
imprisonment:	1
11:37	1
They	1
were	1
stoned,	1
they	1
were	1
sawn	1
asunder,	1
were	1
tempted,	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
goatskins;	1
being	1
destitute,	1
afflicted,	1
tormented;	1
11:38	1
(Of	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
not	1
worthy:)	1
they	1
wandered	1
in	1
deserts,	1
and	1
in	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
dens	1
and	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
these	1
all,	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
through	1
faith,	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
promise:	1
11:40	1
God	1
having	1
provided	1
some	1
better	1
thing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
without	1
us	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
perfect.	1
	1
12:1	1
Wherefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
compassed	1
about	1
with	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
witnesses,	1
let	1
us	1
lay	1
aside	1
every	1
weight,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
doth	1
so	1
easily	1
beset	1
us,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
run	1
with	1
patience	1
the	1
race	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
us,	1
12:2	1
Looking	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
the	1
author	1
and	1
finisher	1
of	1
our	1
faith;	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
before	1
him	1
endured	1
the	1
cross,	1
despising	1
the	1
shame,	1
and	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
consider	1
him	1
that	1
endured	1
such	1
contradiction	1
of	1
sinners	1
against	1
himself,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
wearied	1
and	1
faint	1
in	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
12:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
resisted	1
unto	1
blood,	1
striving	1
against	1
sin.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
exhortation	1
which	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
children,	1
My	1
son,	1
despise	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
faint	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
rebuked	1
of	1
him:	1
12:6	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
loveth	1
he	1
chasteneth,	1
and	1
scourgeth	1
every	1
son	1
whom	1
he	1
receiveth.	1
	1
12:7	1
If	1
ye	1
endure	1
chastening,	1
God	1
dealeth	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
with	1
sons;	1
for	1
what	1
son	1
is	1
he	1
whom	1
the	1
father	1
chasteneth	1
not?	1
	1
12:8	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
without	1
chastisement,	1
whereof	1
all	1
are	1
partakers,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
bastards,	1
and	1
not	1
sons.	1
	1
12:9	1
Furthermore	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
fathers	1
of	1
our	1
flesh	1
which	1
corrected	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
gave	1
them	1
reverence:	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
much	1
rather	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
live?	1
	1
12:10	1
For	1
they	1
verily	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
chastened	1
us	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
he	1
for	1
our	1
profit,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
12:11	1
Now	1
no	1
chastening	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
joyous,	1
but	1
grievous:	1
nevertheless	1
afterward	1
it	1
yieldeth	1
the	1
peaceable	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
exercised	1
thereby.	1
	1
12:12	1
Wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
hang	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees;	1
12:13	1
And	1
make	1
straight	1
paths	1
for	1
your	1
feet,	1
lest	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
rather	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
12:14	1
Follow	1
peace	1
with	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
holiness,	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Lord:	1
12:15	1
Looking	1
diligently	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fail	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God;	1
lest	1
any	1
root	1
of	1
bitterness	1
springing	1
up	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
thereby	1
many	1
be	1
defiled;	1
12:16	1
Lest	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
profane	1
person,	1
as	1
Esau,	1
who	1
for	1
one	1
morsel	1
of	1
meat	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
12:17	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
afterward,	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
inherited	1
the	1
blessing,	1
he	1
was	1
rejected:	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
repentance,	1
though	1
he	1
sought	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
touched,	1
and	1
that	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
nor	1
unto	1
blackness,	1
and	1
darkness,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
12:19	1
And	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
words;	1
which	1
voice	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
intreated	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
spoken	1
to	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
12:20	1
(For	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
commanded,	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
touch	1
the	1
mountain,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
dart:	1
12:21	1
And	1
so	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
sight,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
exceedingly	1
fear	1
and	1
quake:)	1
12:22	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
innumerable	1
company	1
of	1
angels,	1
12:23	1
To	1
the	1
general	1
assembly	1
and	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
just	1
men	1
made	1
perfect,	1
12:24	1
And	1
to	1
Jesus	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
covenant,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
sprinkling,	1
that	1
speaketh	1
better	1
things	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Abel.	1
	1
12:25	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
refuse	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh.	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
escaped	1
not	1
who	1
refused	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
on	1
earth,	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
not	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
from	1
heaven:	1
12:26	1
Whose	1
voice	1
then	1
shook	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
saying,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
shake	1
not	1
the	1
earth	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
this	1
word,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more,	1
signifieth	1
the	1
removing	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
shaken,	1
as	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
shaken	1
may	1
remain.	1
	1
12:28	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
receiving	1
a	1
kingdom	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
grace,	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
God	1
acceptably	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
godly	1
fear:	1
12:29	1
For	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
brotherly	1
love	1
continue.	1
	1
13:2	1
Be	1
not	1
forgetful	1
to	1
entertain	1
strangers:	1
for	1
thereby	1
some	1
have	1
entertained	1
angels	1
unawares.	1
	1
13:3	1
Remember	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
bonds,	1
as	1
bound	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
suffer	1
adversity,	1
as	1
being	1
yourselves	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
13:4	1
Marriage	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
bed	1
undefiled:	1
but	1
whoremongers	1
and	1
adulterers	1
God	1
will	1
judge.	1
	1
13:5	1
Let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
without	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
leave	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
boldly	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
my	1
helper,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear	1
what	1
man	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Remember	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
whose	1
faith	1
follow,	1
considering	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
13:8	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:9	1
Be	1
not	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
divers	1
and	1
strange	1
doctrines.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
be	1
established	1
with	1
grace;	1
not	1
with	1
meats,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
profited	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
therein.	1
	1
13:10	1
We	1
have	1
an	1
altar,	1
whereof	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
eat	1
which	1
serve	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
beasts,	1
whose	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
sin,	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
13:12	1
Wherefore	1
Jesus	1
also,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
suffered	1
without	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
bearing	1
his	1
reproach.	1
	1
13:14	1
For	1
here	1
have	1
we	1
no	1
continuing	1
city,	1
but	1
we	1
seek	1
one	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
13:15	1
By	1
him	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
offer	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
praise	1
to	1
God	1
continually,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
our	1
lips	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
communicate	1
forget	1
not:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
sacrifices	1
God	1
is	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
13:17	1
Obey	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
submit	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
watch	1
for	1
your	1
souls,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
must	1
give	1
account,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
grief:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
unprofitable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
13:18	1
Pray	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
trust	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
willing	1
to	1
live	1
honestly.	1
	1
13:19	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
the	1
rather	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
sooner.	1
	1
13:20	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace,	1
that	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
great	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
13:21	1
Make	1
you	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
working	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wellpleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
suffer	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
13:23	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
our	1
brother	1
Timothy	1
is	1
set	1
at	1
liberty;	1
with	1
whom,	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
shortly,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you.	1
	1
13:24	1
Salute	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
They	1
of	1
Italy	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:25	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
James	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
James,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
greeting.	1
	1
1:2	1
My	1
brethren,	1
count	1
it	1
all	1
joy	1
when	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
divers	1
temptations;	1
1:3	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
trying	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
worketh	1
patience.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
let	1
patience	1
have	1
her	1
perfect	1
work,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
perfect	1
and	1
entire,	1
wanting	1
nothing.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
lack	1
wisdom,	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
liberally,	1
and	1
upbraideth	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
in	1
faith,	1
nothing	1
wavering.	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
wavereth	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
tossed.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
let	1
not	1
that	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:8	1
A	1
double	1
minded	1
man	1
is	1
unstable	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:9	1
Let	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
low	1
degree	1
rejoice	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
exalted:	1
1:10	1
But	1
the	1
rich,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
low:	1
because	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
no	1
sooner	1
risen	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
heat,	1
but	1
it	1
withereth	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth,	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
it	1
perisheth:	1
so	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
fade	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
endureth	1
temptation:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tried,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tempted,	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
cannot	1
be	1
tempted	1
with	1
evil,	1
neither	1
tempteth	1
he	1
any	1
man:	1
1:14	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
tempted,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
away	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
lust,	1
and	1
enticed.	1
	1
1:15	1
Then	1
when	1
lust	1
hath	1
conceived,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
sin:	1
and	1
sin,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
finished,	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
death.	1
	1
1:16	1
Do	1
not	1
err,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:17	1
Every	1
good	1
gift	1
and	1
every	1
perfect	1
gift	1
is	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
lights,	1
with	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
variableness,	1
neither	1
shadow	1
of	1
turning.	1
	1
1:18	1
Of	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
begat	1
he	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
creatures.	1
	1
1:19	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
swift	1
to	1
hear,	1
slow	1
to	1
speak,	1
slow	1
to	1
wrath:	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
man	1
worketh	1
not	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
lay	1
apart	1
all	1
filthiness	1
and	1
superfluity	1
of	1
naughtiness,	1
and	1
receive	1
with	1
meekness	1
the	1
engrafted	1
word,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
hearers	1
only,	1
deceiving	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
be	1
a	1
hearer	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
doer,	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
beholding	1
his	1
natural	1
face	1
in	1
a	1
glass:	1
1:24	1
For	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
goeth	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
straightway	1
forgetteth	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
1:25	1
But	1
whoso	1
looketh	1
into	1
the	1
perfect	1
law	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
continueth	1
therein,	1
he	1
being	1
not	1
a	1
forgetful	1
hearer,	1
but	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
his	1
deed.	1
	1
1:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
religious,	1
and	1
bridleth	1
not	1
his	1
tongue,	1
but	1
deceiveth	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
this	1
man's	1
religion	1
is	1
vain.	1
	1
1:27	1
Pure	1
religion	1
and	1
undefiled	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
this,	1
To	1
visit	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows	1
in	1
their	1
affliction,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
unspotted	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory,	1
with	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
come	1
unto	1
your	1
assembly	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
ring,	1
in	1
goodly	1
apparel,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
also	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
vile	1
raiment;	1
2:3	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
weareth	1
the	1
gay	1
clothing,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
place;	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
Stand	1
thou	1
there,	1
or	1
sit	1
here	1
under	1
my	1
footstool:	1
2:4	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
partial	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
judges	1
of	1
evil	1
thoughts?	1
	1
2:5	1
Hearken,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
Hath	1
not	1
God	1
chosen	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
rich	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
heirs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him?	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
poor.	1
Do	1
not	1
rich	1
men	1
oppress	1
you,	1
and	1
draw	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seats?	1
	1
2:7	1
Do	1
not	1
they	1
blaspheme	1
that	1
worthy	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called?	1
	1
2:8	1
If	1
ye	1
fulfil	1
the	1
royal	1
law	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself,	1
ye	1
do	1
well:	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
persons,	1
ye	1
commit	1
sin,	1
and	1
are	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
transgressors.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
whole	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
offend	1
in	1
one	1
point,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
said	1
also,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill.	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
commit	1
no	1
adultery,	1
yet	1
if	1
thou	1
kill,	1
thou	1
art	1
become	1
a	1
transgressor	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:12	1
So	1
speak	1
ye,	1
and	1
so	1
do,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
liberty.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
judgment	1
without	1
mercy,	1
that	1
hath	1
shewed	1
no	1
mercy;	1
and	1
mercy	1
rejoiceth	1
against	1

	1
2:14	1
What	1
doth	1
it	1
profit,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
say	1
he	1
hath	1
faith,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
works?	1
can	1
faith	1
save	1
him?	1
	1
2:15	1
If	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
sister	1
be	1
naked,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
daily	1
food,	1
2:16	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
be	1
ye	1
warmed	1
and	1
filled;	1
notwithstanding	1
ye	1
give	1
them	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
needful	1
to	1
the	1
body;	1
what	1
doth	1
it	1
profit?	1
	1
2:17	1
Even	1
so	1
faith,	1
if	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
works,	1
is	1
dead,	1
being	1
alone.	1
	1
2:18	1
Yea,	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
say,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
faith,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
works:	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
faith	1
without	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
my	1
faith	1
by	1
my	1
works.	1
	1
2:19	1
Thou	1
believest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
thou	1
doest	1
well:	1
the	1
devils	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
tremble.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
wilt	1
thou	1
know,	1
O	1
vain	1
man,	1
that	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead?	1
2:21	1
Was	1
not	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son	1
upon	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
2:22	1
Seest	1
thou	1
how	1
faith	1
wrought	1
with	1
his	1
works,	1
and	1
by	1
works	1
was	1
faith	1
made	1
perfect?	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith,	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Friend	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:24	1
Ye	1
see	1
then	1
how	1
that	1
by	1
works	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
faith	1
only.	1
	1
2:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
was	1
not	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
out	1
another	1
way?	1
2:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
without	1
the	1
spirit	1
is	1
dead,	1
so	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
3:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
many	1
masters,	1
knowing	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
condemnation.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
we	1
offend	1
all.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
offend	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
and	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
bridle	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:3	1
Behold,	1
we	1
put	1
bits	1
in	1
the	1
horses'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
obey	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
turn	1
about	1
their	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:4	1
Behold	1
also	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
are	1
driven	1
of	1
fierce	1
winds,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
turned	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
helm,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
governor	1
listeth.	1
	1
3:5	1
Even	1
so	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
member,	1
and	1
boasteth	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
Behold,	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
kindleth!	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
fire,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
tongue	1
among	1
our	1
members,	1
that	1
it	1
defileth	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
and	1
setteth	1
on	1
fire	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
nature;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
of	1
hell.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
birds,	1
and	1
of	1
serpents,	1
and	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
is	1
tamed,	1
and	1
hath	1
been	1
tamed	1
of	1
mankind:	1
3:8	1
But	1
the	1
tongue	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
tame;	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unruly	1
evil,	1
full	1
of	1
deadly	1
poison.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therewith	1
bless	1
we	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
therewith	1
curse	1
we	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mouth	1
proceedeth	1
blessing	1
and	1
cursing.	1
My	1
brethren,	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
3:11	1
Doth	1
a	1
fountain	1
send	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
sweet	1
water	1
and	1
bitter?	1
	1
3:12	1
Can	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
bear	1
olive	1
berries?	1
either	1
a	1
vine,	1
figs?	1
so	1
can	1
no	1
fountain	1
both	1
yield	1
salt	1
water	1
and	1
fresh.	1
	1
3:13	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
knowledge	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
shew	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conversation	1
his	1
works	1
with	1
meekness	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
bitter	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
glory	1
not,	1
and	1
lie	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:15	1
This	1
wisdom	1
descendeth	1
not	1
from	1
above,	1
but	1
is	1
earthly,	1
sensual,	1
devilish.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
where	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
confusion	1
and	1
every	1
evil	1
work.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
the	1
wisdom	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
first	1
pure,	1
then	1
peaceable,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
intreated,	1
full	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
good	1
fruits,	1
without	1
partiality,	1
and	1
without	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
peace	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
peace.	1
	1
4:1	1
From	1
whence	1
come	1
wars	1
and	1
fightings	1
among	1
you?	1
come	1
they	1
not	1
hence,	1
even	1
of	1
your	1
lusts	1
that	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
members?	1
	1
4:2	1
Ye	1
lust,	1
and	1
have	1
not:	1
ye	1
kill,	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
cannot	1
obtain:	1
ye	1
fight	1
and	1
war,	1
yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
not.	1
	1
4:3	1
Ye	1
ask,	1
and	1
receive	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
amiss,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
consume	1
it	1
upon	1
your	1
lusts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
adulterers	1
and	1
adulteresses,	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
enmity	1
with	1
God?	1
whosoever	1
therefore	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Do	1
ye	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
in	1
vain,	1
The	1
spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us	1
lusteth	1
to	1
envy?	1
	1
4:6	1
But	1
he	1
giveth	1
more	1
grace.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
but	1
giveth	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
4:7	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
to	1
God.	1
Resist	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
4:8	1
Draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
you.	1
Cleanse	1
your	1
hands,	1
ye	1
sinners;	1
and	1
purify	1
your	1
hearts,	1
ye	1
double	1
minded.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
mourn,	1
and	1
weep:	1
let	1
your	1
laughter	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
to	1
heaviness.	1
	1
4:10	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lift	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
4:11	1
Speak	1
not	1
evil	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
his	1
brother,	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
judge	1
the	1
law,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
a	1
judge.	1
	1
4:12	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
lawgiver,	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another?	1
	1
4:13	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
that	1
say,	1
To	1
day	1
or	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
continue	1
there	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
buy	1
and	1
sell,	1
and	1
get	1
gain:	1
4:14	1
Whereas	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
life?	1
It	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
vapour,	1
that	1
appeareth	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
vanisheth	1
away.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
that	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say,	1
If	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
we	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
do	1
this,	1
or	1
that.	1
	1
4:16	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
in	1
your	1
boastings:	1
all	1
such	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
4:17	1
Therefore	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knoweth	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
5:1	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
rich	1
men,	1
weep	1
and	1
howl	1
for	1
your	1
miseries	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
Your	1
riches	1
are	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
your	1
garments	1
are	1
motheaten.	1
	1
5:3	1
Your	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
is	1
cankered;	1
and	1
the	1
rust	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
flesh	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fire.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heaped	1
treasure	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
5:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
who	1
have	1
reaped	1
down	1
your	1
fields,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
fraud,	1
crieth:	1
and	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
reaped	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
sabaoth.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
been	1
wanton;	1
ye	1
have	1
nourished	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
5:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
condemned	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
just;	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
resist	1
you.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
patient	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
Behold,	1
the	1
husbandman	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
long	1
patience	1
for	1
it,	1
until	1
he	1
receive	1
the	1
early	1
and	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
ye	1
also	1
patient;	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
5:9	1
Grudge	1
not	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
condemned:	1
behold,	1
the	1
judge	1
standeth	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
5:10	1
Take,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
the	1
prophets,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
suffering	1
affliction,	1
and	1
of	1
patience.	1
	1
5:11	1
Behold,	1
we	1
count	1
them	1
happy	1
which	1
endure.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
Job,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
very	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
of	1
tender	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:12	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
swear	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
by	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
oath:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
yea	1
be	1
yea;	1
and	1
your	1
nay,	1
nay;	1
lest	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
condemnation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Is	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
afflicted?	1
let	1
him	1
pray.	1
Is	1
any	1
merry?	1
let	1
him	1
sing	1
psalms.	1
	1
5:14	1
Is	1
any	1
sick	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
pray	1
over	1
him,	1
anointing	1
him	1
with	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
faith	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
committed	1
sins,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
Confess	1
your	1
faults	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
pray	1
one	1
for	1
another,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
healed.	1
The	1
effectual	1
fervent	1
prayer	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
availeth	1
much.	1
	1
5:17	1
Elias	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
to	1
like	1
passions	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
earnestly	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
rain:	1
and	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
gave	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
5:19	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
err	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
one	1
convert	1
him;	1
5:20	1
Let	1
him	1
know,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
converteth	1
the	1
sinner	1
from	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
shall	1
save	1
a	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
hide	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Peter,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
scattered	1
throughout	1
Pontus,	1
Galatia,	1
Cappadocia,	1
Asia,	1
and	1
Bithynia,	1
1:2	1
Elect	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
unto	1
obedience	1
and	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
abundant	1
mercy	1
hath	1
begotten	1
us	1
again	1
unto	1
a	1
lively	1
hope	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
1:4	1
To	1
an	1
inheritance	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
undefiled,	1
and	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away,	1
reserved	1
in	1
heaven	1
for	1
you,	1
1:5	1
Who	1
are	1
kept	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
faith	1
unto	1
salvation	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherein	1
ye	1
greatly	1
rejoice,	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
heaviness	1
through	1
manifold	1
temptations:	1
1:7	1
That	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
being	1
much	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
perisheth,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
tried	1
with	1
fire,	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
praise	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
at	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Whom	1
having	1
not	1
seen,	1
ye	1
love;	1
in	1
whom,	1
though	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
not,	1
yet	1
believing,	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
with	1
joy	1
unspeakable	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:9	1
Receiving	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
even	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:10	1
Of	1
which	1
salvation	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
enquired	1
and	1
searched	1
diligently,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
you:	1
1:11	1
Searching	1
what,	1
or	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
did	1
signify,	1
when	1
it	1
testified	1
beforehand	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
should	1
follow.	1
	1
1:12	1
Unto	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
revealed,	1
that	1
not	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
they	1
did	1
minister	1
the	1
things,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
reported	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
which	1
things	1
the	1
angels	1
desire	1
to	1
look	1
into.	1
	1
1:13	1
Wherefore	1
gird	1
up	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
be	1
sober,	1
and	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:14	1
As	1
obedient	1
children,	1
not	1
fashioning	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
lusts	1
in	1
your	1
ignorance:	1
1:15	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
is	1
holy,	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
holy	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
conversation;	1
1:16	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Be	1
ye	1
holy;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
without	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
judgeth	1
according	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
work,	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
sojourning	1
here	1
in	1
fear:	1
1:18	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
redeemed	1
with	1
corruptible	1
things,	1
as	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
from	1
your	1
vain	1
conversation	1
received	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
your	1
fathers;	1
1:19	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
without	1
blemish	1
and	1
without	1
spot:	1
1:20	1
Who	1
verily	1
was	1
foreordained	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
times	1
for	1
you,	1
1:21	1
Who	1
by	1
him	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
that	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
glory;	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
1:22	1
Seeing	1
ye	1
have	1
purified	1
your	1
souls	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
truth	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
unfeigned	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
pure	1
heart	1
fervently:	1
1:23	1
Being	1
born	1
again,	1
not	1
of	1
corruptible	1
seed,	1
but	1
of	1
incorruptible,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
liveth	1
and	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:24	1
For	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
grass.	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth	1
away:	1
1:25	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:1	1
Wherefore	1
laying	1
aside	1
all	1
malice,	1
and	1
all	1
guile,	1
and	1
hypocrisies,	1
and	1
envies,	1
all	1
evil	1
speakings,	1
2:2	1
As	1
newborn	1
babes,	1
desire	1
the	1
sincere	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
grow	1
thereby:	1
2:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
have	1
tasted	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
gracious.	1
	1
2:4	1
To	1
whom	1
coming,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
living	1
stone,	1
disallowed	1
indeed	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
chosen	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
precious,	1
2:5	1
Ye	1
also,	1
as	1
lively	1
stones,	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
a	1
spiritual	1
house,	1
an	1
holy	1
priesthood,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
spiritual	1
sacrifices,	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
it	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone,	1
elect,	1
precious:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
2:7	1
Unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
which	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
precious:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
disobedient,	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
disallowed,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
2:8	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling,	1
and	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
word,	1
being	1
disobedient:	1
whereunto	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
appointed.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
generation,	1
a	1
royal	1
priesthood,	1
an	1
holy	1
nation,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
into	1
his	1
marvellous	1
light;	1
2:10	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
people,	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
obtained	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:11	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
as	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims,	1
abstain	1
from	1
fleshly	1
lusts,	1
which	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
soul;	1
2:12	1
Having	1
your	1
conversation	1
honest	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
against	1
you	1
as	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
by	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
behold,	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation.	1
	1
2:13	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
to	1
every	1
ordinance	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake:	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
supreme;	1
2:14	1
Or	1
unto	1
governors,	1
as	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
with	1
well	1
doing	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
to	1
silence	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
foolish	1
men:	1
2:16	1
As	1
free,	1
and	1
not	1
using	1
your	1
liberty	1
for	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
maliciousness,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:17	1
Honour	1
all	1
men.	1
Love	1
the	1
brotherhood.	1
Fear	1
God.	1
Honour	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:18	1
Servants,	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
your	1
masters	1
with	1
all	1
fear;	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
gentle,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
froward.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
thankworthy,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God	1
endure	1
grief,	1
suffering	1
wrongfully.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
what	1
glory	1
is	1
it,	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
buffeted	1
for	1
your	1
faults,	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
patiently?	1
but	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
suffer	1
for	1
it,	1
ye	1
take	1
it	1
patiently,	1
this	1
is	1
acceptable	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
even	1
hereunto	1
were	1
ye	1
called:	1
because	1
Christ	1
also	1
suffered	1
for	1
us,	1
leaving	1
us	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
follow	1
his	1
steps:	1
2:22	1
Who	1
did	1
no	1
sin,	1
neither	1
was	1
guile	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
2:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reviled,	1
reviled	1
not	1
again;	1
when	1
he	1
suffered,	1
he	1
threatened	1
not;	1
but	1
committed	1
himself	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
judgeth	1
righteously:	1
2:24	1
Who	1
his	1
own	1
self	1
bare	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
tree,	1
that	1
we,	1
being	1
dead	1
to	1
sins,	1
should	1
live	1
unto	1
righteousness:	1
by	1
whose	1
stripes	1
ye	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
going	1
astray;	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
Shepherd	1
and	1
Bishop	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
3:1	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
wives,	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
husbands;	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
word,	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
without	1
the	1
word	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wives;	1
3:2	1
While	1
they	1
behold	1
your	1
chaste	1
conversation	1
coupled	1
with	1
fear.	1
	1
3:3	1
Whose	1
adorning	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
outward	1
adorning	1
of	1
plaiting	1
the	1
hair,	1
and	1
of	1
wearing	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
of	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
apparel;	1
3:4	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
hidden	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
corruptible,	1
even	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
a	1
meek	1
and	1
quiet	1
spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
great	1
price.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
time	1
the	1
holy	1
women	1
also,	1
who	1
trusted	1
in	1
God,	1
adorned	1
themselves,	1
being	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
husbands:	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Sara	1
obeyed	1
Abraham,	1
calling	1
him	1
lord:	1
whose	1
daughters	1
ye	1
are,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
with	1
any	1
amazement.	1
	1
3:7	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
husbands,	1
dwell	1
with	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge,	1
giving	1
honour	1
unto	1
the	1
wife,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
weaker	1
vessel,	1
and	1
as	1
being	1
heirs	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
your	1
prayers	1
be	1
not	1
hindered.	1
	1
3:8	1
Finally,	1
be	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
having	1
compassion	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
love	1
as	1
brethren,	1
be	1
pitiful,	1
be	1
courteous:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
rendering	1
evil	1
for	1
evil,	1
or	1
railing	1
for	1
railing:	1
but	1
contrariwise	1
blessing;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
thereunto	1
called,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
inherit	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
love	1
life,	1
and	1
see	1
good	1
days,	1
let	1
him	1
refrain	1
his	1
tongue	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
no	1
guile:	1
3:11	1
Let	1
him	1
eschew	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
let	1
him	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
ensue	1
it.	1
	1
3:12	1
For	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
over	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
open	1
unto	1
their	1
prayers:	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
harm	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
followers	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good?	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
terror,	1
neither	1
be	1
troubled;	1
3:15	1
But	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
always	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
you	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
with	1
meekness	1
and	1
fear:	1
3:16	1
Having	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
falsely	1
accuse	1
your	1
good	1
conversation	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
better,	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
so,	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
well	1
doing,	1
than	1
for	1
evil	1
doing.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
once	1
suffered	1
for	1
sins,	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
unjust,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
to	1
God,	1
being	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
quickened	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit:	1
3:19	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
spirits	1
in	1
prison;	1
3:20	1
Which	1
sometime	1
were	1
disobedient,	1
when	1
once	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
God	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
was	1
a	1
preparing,	1
wherein	1
few,	1
that	1
is,	1
eight	1
souls	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
water.	1
	1
3:21	1
The	1
like	1
figure	1
whereunto	1
even	1
baptism	1
doth	1
also	1
now	1
save	1
us	1
(not	1
the	1
putting	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God,)	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:22	1
Who	1
is	1
gone	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
angels	1
and	1
authorities	1
and	1
powers	1
being	1
made	1
subject	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
Christ	1
hath	1
suffered	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
arm	1
yourselves	1
likewise	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
mind:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
sin;	1
4:2	1
That	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
should	1
live	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
past	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
may	1
suffice	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
wrought	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
when	1
we	1
walked	1
in	1
lasciviousness,	1
lusts,	1
excess	1
of	1
wine,	1
revellings,	1
banquetings,	1
and	1
abominable	1
idolatries:	1
4:4	1
Wherein	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
ye	1
run	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
excess	1
of	1
riot,	1
speaking	1
evil	1
of	1
you:	1
4:5	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
live	1
according	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
sober,	1
and	1
watch	1
unto	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
fervent	1
charity	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
charity	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
4:9	1
Use	1
hospitality	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
without	1
grudging.	1
	1
4:10	1
As	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
received	1
the	1
gift,	1
even	1
so	1
minister	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
good	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:11	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
as	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
minister,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ability	1
which	1
God	1
giveth:	1
that	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
praise	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:12	1
Beloved,	1
think	1
it	1
not	1
strange	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiery	1
trial	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
try	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
strange	1
thing	1
happened	1
unto	1
you:	1
4:13	1
But	1
rejoice,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ's	1
sufferings;	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
also	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy.	1
	1
4:14	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
reproached	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
resteth	1
upon	1
you:	1
on	1
their	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of,	1
but	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
glorified.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
murderer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
or	1
as	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
busybody	1
in	1
other	1
men's	1
matters.	1
	1
4:16	1
Yet	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
glorify	1
God	1
on	1
this	1
behalf.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
that	1
judgment	1
must	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
first	1
begin	1
at	1
us,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
be	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
righteous	1
scarcely	1
be	1
saved,	1
where	1
shall	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
the	1
sinner	1
appear?	1
	1
4:19	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
suffer	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
commit	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
well	1
doing,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
faithful	1
Creator.	1
	1
5:1	1
The	1
elders	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you	1
I	1
exhort,	1
who	1
am	1
also	1
an	1
elder,	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed:	1
5:2	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
taking	1
the	1
oversight	1
thereof,	1
not	1
by	1
constraint,	1
but	1
willingly;	1
not	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
ready	1
mind;	1
5:3	1
Neither	1
as	1
being	1
lords	1
over	1
God's	1
heritage,	1
but	1
being	1
ensamples	1
to	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
Shepherd	1
shall	1
appear,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
5:5	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
younger,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
elder.	1
Yea,	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
subject	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
humility:	1
for	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
and	1
giveth	1
grace	1
to	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
5:6	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
under	1
the	1
mighty	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
exalt	1
you	1
in	1
due	1
time:	1
5:7	1
Casting	1
all	1
your	1
care	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
careth	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
sober,	1
be	1
vigilant;	1
because	1
your	1
adversary	1
the	1
devil,	1
as	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
walketh	1
about,	1
seeking	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
devour:	1
5:9	1
Whom	1
resist	1
stedfast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
afflictions	1
are	1
accomplished	1
in	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:10	1
But	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
grace,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
his	1
eternal	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
suffered	1
a	1
while,	1
make	1
you	1
perfect,	1
stablish,	1
strengthen,	1
settle	1
you.	1
	1
5:11	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
5:12	1
By	1
Silvanus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
brother	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
suppose,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
briefly,	1
exhorting,	1
and	1
testifying	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
5:13	1
The	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
Babylon,	1
elected	1
together	1
with	1
you,	1
saluteth	1
you;	1
and	1
so	1
doth	1
Marcus	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
5:14	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
charity.	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1

	1
The	1
Second	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
a	1
servant	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
obtained	1
like	1
precious	1
faith	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
1:3	1
According	1
as	1
his	1
divine	1
power	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
unto	1
life	1
and	1
godliness,	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
glory	1
and	1
virtue:	1
1:4	1
Whereby	1
are	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
exceeding	1
great	1
and	1
precious	1
promises:	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
nature,	1
having	1
escaped	1
the	1
corruption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
lust.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
beside	1
this,	1
giving	1
all	1
diligence,	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
virtue;	1
and	1
to	1
virtue	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
And	1
to	1
knowledge	1
temperance;	1
and	1
to	1
temperance	1
patience;	1
and	1
to	1
patience	1
godliness;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
godliness	1
brotherly	1
kindness;	1
and	1
to	1
brotherly	1
kindness	1
charity.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
abound,	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
barren	1
nor	1
unfruitful	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
lacketh	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
blind,	1
and	1
cannot	1
see	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
purged	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
sins.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
rather,	1
brethren,	1
give	1
diligence	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
calling	1
and	1
election	1
sure:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
fall:	1
1:11	1
For	1
so	1
an	1
entrance	1
shall	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto	1
you	1
abundantly	1
into	1
the	1
everlasting	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:12	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
negligent	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
though	1
ye	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
truth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Yea,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
meet,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle,	1
to	1
stir	1
you	1
up	1
by	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance;	1
1:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
shortly	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
my	1
tabernacle,	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me.	1
	1
1:15	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
after	1
my	1
decease	1
to	1
have	1
these	1
things	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
followed	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
fables,	1
when	1
we	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
were	1
eyewitnesses	1
of	1
his	1
majesty.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
honour	1
and	1
glory,	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
excellent	1
glory,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
this	1
voice	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
heaven	1
we	1
heard,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount.	1
	1
1:19	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
a	1
more	1
sure	1
word	1
of	1
prophecy;	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
do	1
well	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
heed,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
light	1
that	1
shineth	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
dawn,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
star	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
1:20	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
no	1
prophecy	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
private	1
interpretation.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
the	1
prophecy	1
came	1
not	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man:	1
but	1
holy	1
men	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
false	1
prophets	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
as	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
false	1
teachers	1
among	1
you,	1
who	1
privily	1
shall	1
bring	1
in	1
damnable	1
heresies,	1
even	1
denying	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
upon	1
themselves	1
swift	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
many	1
shall	1
follow	1
their	1
pernicious	1
ways;	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
through	1
covetousness	1
shall	1
they	1
with	1
feigned	1
words	1
make	1
merchandise	1
of	1
you:	1
whose	1
judgment	1
now	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
lingereth	1
not,	1
and	1
their	1
damnation	1
slumbereth	1
not.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
that	1
sinned,	1
but	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
chains	1
of	1
darkness,	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
judgment;	1
2:5	1
And	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
world,	1
but	1
saved	1
Noah	1
the	1
eighth	1
person,	1
a	1
preacher	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly;	1
2:6	1
And	1
turning	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
into	1
ashes	1
condemned	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
overthrow,	1
making	1
them	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
after	1
should	1
live	1
ungodly;	1
2:7	1
And	1
delivered	1
just	1
Lot,	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
filthy	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
2:8	1
(For	1
that	1
righteous	1
man	1
dwelling	1
among	1
them,	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing,	1
vexed	1
his	1
righteous	1
soul	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
their	1
unlawful	1
deeds;)	1
2:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
how	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
godly	1
out	1
of	1
temptations,	1
and	1
to	1
reserve	1
the	1
unjust	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
be	1
punished:	1
2:10	1
But	1
chiefly	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
and	1
despise	1
government.	1
Presumptuous	1
are	1
they,	1
selfwilled,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
2:11	1
Whereas	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
greater	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
might,	1
bring	1
not	1
railing	1
accusation	1
against	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
these,	1
as	1
natural	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
utterly	1
perish	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
corruption;	1
2:13	1
And	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
unrighteousness,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
count	1
it	1
pleasure	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time.	1
Spots	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
blemishes,	1
sporting	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
deceivings	1
while	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you;	1
2:14	1
Having	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
adultery,	1
and	1
that	1
cannot	1
cease	1
from	1
sin;	1
beguiling	1
unstable	1
souls:	1
an	1
heart	1
they	1
have	1
exercised	1
with	1
covetous	1
practices;	1
cursed	1
children:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
right	1
way,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
astray,	1
following	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bosor,	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
2:16	1
But	1
was	1
rebuked	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
dumb	1
ass	1
speaking	1
with	1
man's	1
voice	1
forbad	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
2:17	1
These	1
are	1
wells	1
without	1
water,	1
clouds	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
with	1
a	1
tempest;	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
great	1
swelling	1
words	1
of	1
vanity,	1
they	1
allure	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
through	1
much	1
wantonness,	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
clean	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
error.	1
	1
2:19	1
While	1
they	1
promise	1
them	1
liberty,	1
they	1
themselves	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
of	1
whom	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
overcome,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
if	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
pollutions	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
are	1
again	1
entangled	1
therein,	1
and	1
overcome,	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
is	1
worse	1
with	1
them	1
than	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
than,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
commandment	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
proverb,	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
vomit	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
sow	1
that	1
was	1
washed	1
to	1
her	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
second	1
epistle,	1
beloved,	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
unto	1
you;	1
in	1
both	1
which	1
I	1
stir	1
up	1
your	1
pure	1
minds	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
remembrance:	1
3:2	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour:	1
3:3	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
scoffers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts,	1
3:4	1
And	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
fathers	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
all	1
things	1
continue	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
they	1
willingly	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
standing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
water:	1
3:6	1
Whereby	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
then	1
was,	1
being	1
overflowed	1
with	1
water,	1
perished:	1
3:7	1
But	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
are	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
word	1
are	1
kept	1
in	1
store,	1
reserved	1
unto	1
fire	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
perdition	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men.	1
	1
3:8	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
be	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
as	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
slack	1
concerning	1
his	1
promise,	1
as	1
some	1
men	1
count	1
slackness;	1
but	1
is	1
longsuffering	1
to	1
us-ward,	1
not	1
willing	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
perish,	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat,	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
are	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
up.	1
	1
3:11	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
persons	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
holy	1
conversation	1
and	1
godliness,	1
3:12	1
Looking	1
for	1
and	1
hasting	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
God,	1
wherein	1
the	1
heavens	1
being	1
on	1
fire	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat?	1
	1
3:13	1
Nevertheless	1
we,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise,	1
look	1
for	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
dwelleth	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:14	1
Wherefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
such	1
things,	1
be	1
diligent	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
peace,	1
without	1
spot,	1
and	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
account	1
that	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
is	1
salvation;	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Paul	1
also	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
written	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:16	1
As	1
also	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
epistles,	1
speaking	1
in	1
them	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
in	1
which	1
are	1
some	1
things	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned	1
and	1
unstable	1
wrest,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
scriptures,	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
destruction.	1
	1
3:17	1
Ye	1
therefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
before,	1
beware	1
lest	1
ye	1
also,	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
fall	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
stedfastness.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
grow	1
in	1
grace,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
our	1
eyes,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
looked	1
upon,	1
and	1
our	1
hands	1
have	1
handled,	1
of	1
the	1
Word	1
of	1
life;	1
1:2	1
(For	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
manifested,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
bear	1
witness,	1
and	1
shew	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
was	1
manifested	1
unto	1
us;)	1
1:3	1
That	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
declare	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
truly	1
our	1
fellowship	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:5	1
This	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
light,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
darkness	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
1:6	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
we	1
lie,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
his	1
Son	1
cleanseth	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
sin.	1
	1
1:8	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
sin,	1
we	1
deceive	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:9	1
If	1
we	1
confess	1
our	1
sins,	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
and	1
just	1
to	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
cleanse	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
sinned,	1
we	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
sin,	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
advocate	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
righteous:	1
2:2	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins:	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
our's	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
that	1
saith,	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
not	1
his	1
commandments,	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
whoso	1
keepeth	1
his	1
word,	1
in	1
him	1
verily	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
perfected:	1
hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
ought	1
himself	1
also	1
so	1
to	1
walk,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
	1
2:7	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
write	1
no	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
an	1
old	1
commandment	1
which	1
ye	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
The	1
old	1
commandment	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:8	1
Again,	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
you:	1
because	1
the	1
darkness	1
is	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
light	1
now	1
shineth.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
is	1
in	1
darkness	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:10	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
occasion	1
of	1
stumbling	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth,	1
because	1
that	1
darkness	1
hath	1
blinded	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
your	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
2:13	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:14	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
	1
2:15	1
Love	1
not	1
the	1
world,	1
neither	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
life,	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
world	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
thereof:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
Little	1
children,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time:	1
and	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
antichrist	1
shall	1
come,	1
even	1
now	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
antichrists;	1
whereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
2:19	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
us;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
us:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
an	1
unction	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
One,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
lie	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:22	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ?	1
He	1
is	1
antichrist,	1
that	1
denieth	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
2:23	1
Whosoever	1
denieth	1
the	1
Son,	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Father:	1
he	1
that	1
acknowledgeth	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
2:24	1
Let	1
that	1
therefore	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
If	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
us,	1
even	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
2:26	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
them	1
that	1
seduce	1
you.	1
	1
2:27	1
But	1
the	1
anointing	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
him	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
you:	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
anointing	1
teacheth	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
is	1
truth,	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
lie,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
taught	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
now,	1
little	1
children,	1
abide	1
in	1
him;	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
confidence,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
before	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
2:29	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
righteous,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God:	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
knoweth	1
us	1
not,	1
because	1
it	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beloved,	1
now	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
doth	1
not	1
yet	1
appear	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
be:	1
but	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
him;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
this	1
hope	1
in	1
him	1
purifieth	1
himself,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
pure.	1
	1
3:4	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
transgresseth	1
also	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
manifested	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
sins;	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
sin.	1
	1
3:6	1
Whosoever	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
whosoever	1
sinneth	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
him,	1
neither	1
known	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
Little	1
children,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
righteous,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:8	1
He	1
that	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
sinneth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
manifested,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:9	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
doth	1
not	1
commit	1
sin;	1
for	1
his	1
seed	1
remaineth	1
in	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
sin,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
manifest,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
devil:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
not	1
righteousness	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
Cain,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brother.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
slew	1
he	1
him?	1
Because	1
his	1
own	1
works	1
were	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:13	1
Marvel	1
not,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life,	1
because	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
death.	1
	1
3:15	1
Whosoever	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
murderer	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life	1
abiding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
Hereby	1
perceive	1
we	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
whoso	1
hath	1
this	1
world's	1
good,	1
and	1
seeth	1
his	1
brother	1
have	1
need,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
up	1
his	1
bowels	1
of	1
compassion	1
from	1
him,	1
how	1
dwelleth	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him?	1
	1
3:18	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
love	1
in	1
word,	1
neither	1
in	1
tongue;	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
assure	1
our	1
hearts	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us,	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
heart,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:21	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us	1
not,	1
then	1
have	1
we	1
confidence	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
receive	1
of	1
him,	1
because	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
commandment,	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
commandment.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
commandments	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us.	1
	1
4:1	1
Beloved,	1
believe	1
not	1
every	1
spirit,	1
but	1
try	1
the	1
spirits	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
because	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:2	1
Hereby	1
know	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
Every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
4:3	1
And	1
every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
antichrist,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come;	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
already	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
have	1
overcome	1
them:	1
because	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:5	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
therefore	1
speak	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
heareth	1
them.	1
	1
4:6	1
We	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
God	1
heareth	1
us;	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
us.	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
error.	1
	1
4:7	1
Beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
knoweth	1
not	1
God;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
love.	1
	1
4:9	1
In	1
this	1
was	1
manifested	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
us,	1
because	1
that	1
God	1
sent	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
live	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
4:10	1
Herein	1
is	1
love,	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
loved	1
God,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins.	1
	1
4:11	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
us,	1
we	1
ought	1
also	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:12	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
If	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
his	1
love	1
is	1
perfected	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
4:13	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
dwell	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
us,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
do	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
sent	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:15	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
to	1
us.	1
God	1
is	1
love;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
love	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
Herein	1
is	1
our	1
love	1
made	1
perfect,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment:	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
4:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
perfect	1
love	1
casteth	1
out	1
fear:	1
because	1
fear	1
hath	1
torment.	1
He	1
that	1
feareth	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:19	1
We	1
love	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
4:20	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
seen,	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
love	1
God	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen?	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
this	1
commandment	1
have	1
we	1
from	1
him,	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
loveth	1
God	1
love	1
his	1
brother	1
also.	1
	1
5:1	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
him	1
that	1
begat	1
loveth	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:2	1
By	1
this	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
when	1
we	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
and	1
his	1
commandments	1
are	1
not	1
grievous.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
5:5	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
5:6	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood,	1
even	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
not	1
by	1
water	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness,	1
because	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
record	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
Father,	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
in	1
earth,	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
agree	1
in	1
one.	1
	1
5:9	1
If	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
men,	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
testified	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:10	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
the	1
witness	1
in	1
himself:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
liar;	1
because	1
he	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
record	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:12	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
life.	1
	1
5:13	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
confidence	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
him,	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
heareth	1
us:	1
5:15	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
hear	1
us,	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
petitions	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
sin	1
a	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
he	1
shall	1
ask,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
life	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
unto	1
death:	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
5:17	1
All	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
sin:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
5:18	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
sinneth	1
not;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
God	1
keepeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
wicked	1
one	1
toucheth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
lieth	1
in	1
wickedness.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
an	1
understanding,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
Little	1
children,	1
keep	1
yourselves	1
from	1
idols.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
elect	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
children,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
not	1
I	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
truth;	1
1:2	1
For	1
the	1
truth's	1
sake,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
of	1
thy	1
children	1
walking	1
in	1
truth,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
from	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lady,	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
love,	1
that	1
we	1
walk	1
after	1
his	1
commandments.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
commandment,	1
That,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
ye	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
many	1
deceivers	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
who	1
confess	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
deceiver	1
and	1
an	1
antichrist.	1
	1
1:8	1
Look	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
wrought,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
receive	1
a	1
full	1
reward.	1
	1
1:9	1
Whosoever	1
transgresseth,	1
and	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
not	1
God.	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
there	1
come	1
any	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
receive	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
your	1
house,	1
neither	1
bid	1
him	1
God	1
speed:	1
1:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
biddeth	1
him	1
God	1
speed	1
is	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
deeds.	1
	1
1:12	1
Having	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
paper	1
and	1
ink:	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
that	1
our	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:13	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
elect	1
sister	1
greet	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Third	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
wellbeloved	1
Gaius,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:2	1
Beloved,	1
I	1
wish	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
health,	1
even	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
prospereth.	1
	1
1:3	1
For	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
came	1
and	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
walkest	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
greater	1
joy	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
walk	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Beloved,	1
thou	1
doest	1
faithfully	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
strangers;	1
1:6	1
Which	1
have	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
thy	1
charity	1
before	1
the	1
church:	1
whom	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
forward	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
well:	1
1:7	1
Because	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
taking	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:8	1
We	1
therefore	1
ought	1
to	1
receive	1
such,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
fellowhelpers	1
to	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
Diotrephes,	1
who	1
loveth	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence	1
among	1
them,	1
receiveth	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
his	1
deeds	1
which	1
he	1
doeth,	1
prating	1
against	1
us	1
with	1
malicious	1
words:	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
therewith,	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
himself	1
receive	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
forbiddeth	1
them	1
that	1
would,	1
and	1
casteth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
1:11	1
Beloved,	1
follow	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
He	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
Demetrius	1
hath	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
itself:	1
yea,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
bear	1
record;	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
our	1
record	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
1:13	1
I	1
had	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
with	1
ink	1
and	1
pen	1
write	1
unto	1
thee:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
shall	1
shortly	1
see	1
thee,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
thee.	1
Our	1
friends	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
the	1
friends	1
by	1
name.	1

The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Jude	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Jude,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
preserved	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
called:	1
1:2	1
Mercy	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
love,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Beloved,	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
salvation,	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
earnestly	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
was	1
once	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
1:4	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
men	1
crept	1
in	1
unawares,	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
of	1
old	1
ordained	1
to	1
this	1
condemnation,	1
ungodly	1
men,	1
turning	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
into	1
lasciviousness,	1
and	1
denying	1
the	1
only	1
Lord	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
though	1
ye	1
once	1
knew	1
this,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
saved	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
afterward	1
destroyed	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
kept	1
not	1
their	1
first	1
estate,	1
but	1
left	1
their	1
own	1
habitation,	1
he	1
hath	1
reserved	1
in	1
everlasting	1
chains	1
under	1
darkness	1
unto	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
day.	1
	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
giving	1
themselves	1
over	1
to	1
fornication,	1
and	1
going	1
after	1
strange	1
flesh,	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
suffering	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
eternal	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
Likewise	1
also	1
these	1
filthy	1
dreamers	1
defile	1
the	1
flesh,	1
despise	1
dominion,	1
and	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
Michael	1
the	1
archangel,	1
when	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
disputed	1
about	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Moses,	1
durst	1
not	1
bring	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
railing	1
accusation,	1
but	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
1:10	1
But	1
these	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not:	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
know	1
naturally,	1
as	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
they	1
corrupt	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Cain,	1
and	1
ran	1
greedily	1
after	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
Balaam	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
gainsaying	1
of	1
Core.	1
	1
1:12	1
These	1
are	1
spots	1
in	1
your	1
feasts	1
of	1
charity,	1
when	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you,	1
feeding	1
themselves	1
without	1
fear:	1
clouds	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
water,	1
carried	1
about	1
of	1
winds;	1
trees	1
whose	1
fruit	1
withereth,	1
without	1
fruit,	1
twice	1
dead,	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots;	1
1:13	1
Raging	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
foaming	1
out	1
their	1
own	1
shame;	1
wandering	1
stars,	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
reserved	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Enoch	1
also,	1
the	1
seventh	1
from	1
Adam,	1
prophesied	1
of	1
these,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
cometh	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
1:15	1
To	1
execute	1
judgment	1
upon	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
ungodly	1
among	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
ungodly	1
deeds	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
ungodly	1
committed,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
hard	1
speeches	1
which	1
ungodly	1
sinners	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
1:16	1
These	1
are	1
murmurers,	1
complainers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts;	1
and	1
their	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
great	1
swelling	1
words,	1
having	1
men's	1
persons	1
in	1
admiration	1
because	1
of	1
advantage.	1
	1
1:17	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
remember	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:18	1
How	1
that	1
they	1
told	1
you	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
mockers	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
who	1
should	1
walk	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
ungodly	1
lusts.	1
	1
1:19	1
These	1
be	1
they	1
who	1
separate	1
themselves,	1
sensual,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
ye,	1
beloved,	1
building	1
up	1
yourselves	1
on	1
your	1
most	1
holy	1
faith,	1
praying	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
1:21	1
Keep	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
of	1
some	1
have	1
compassion,	1
making	1
a	1
difference:	1
1:23	1
And	1
others	1
save	1
with	1
fear,	1
pulling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
hating	1
even	1
the	1
garment	1
spotted	1
by	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
1:24	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
falling,	1
and	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
faultless	1
before	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy,	1
1:25	1
To	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
majesty,	1
dominion	1
and	1
power,	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Saint	1
John	1
the	1

	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
signified	1
it	1
by	1
his	1
angel	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
John:	1
1:2	1
Who	1
bare	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
saw.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
readeth,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
keep	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia:	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
is,	1
and	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
his	1
throne;	1
1:5	1
And	1
from	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
witness,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Unto	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
washed	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
1:6	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
kings	1
and	1
priests	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
Father;	1
to	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:7	1
Behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
clouds;	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
pierced	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wail	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
Even	1
so,	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1

which	1
is	1
to	1

1:9	1
I	1
John,	1
who	1
also	1
am	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
isle	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Patmos,	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
on	1
the	1
Lord's	1
day,	1
and	1
heard	1
behind	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
voice,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
1:11	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
and,	1
What	1
thou	1
seest,	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia;	1
unto	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
unto	1
Smyrna,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pergamos,	1
and	1
unto	1
Thyatira,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sardis,	1
and	1
unto	1
Philadelphia,	1
and	1
unto	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
spake	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
being	1
turned,	1
I	1
saw	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
1:13	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
one	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot,	1
and	1
girt	1
about	1
the	1
paps	1
with	1
a	1
golden	1
girdle.	1
	1
1:14	1
His	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
white	1
like	1
wool,	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire;	1
1:15	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
unto	1
fine	1
brass,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
burned	1
in	1
a	1
furnace;	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
seven	1
stars:	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
a	1
sharp	1
twoedged	1
sword:	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
shineth	1
in	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
dead.	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
1:18	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
was	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
for	1
evermore,	1
Amen;	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
1:19	1
Write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
hereafter;	1
1:20	1
The	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks.	1
The	1
seven	1
stars	1
are	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
churches:	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
churches.	1
	1
2:1	1
Unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Ephesus	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
who	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
2:2	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
thy	1
labour,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
evil:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
apostles,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
hast	1
found	1
them	1
liars:	1
2:3	1
And	1
hast	1
borne,	1
and	1
hast	1
patience,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
fainted.	1
	1
2:4	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
first	1
love.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
art	1
fallen,	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
first	1
works;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
remove	1
thy	1
candlestick	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
except	1
thou	1
repent.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
this	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
thou	1
hatest	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
hate.	1
	1
2:7	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Smyrna	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive;	1
2:9	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
poverty,	1
(but	1
thou	1
art	1
rich)	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
are	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan.	1
	1
2:10	1
Fear	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
suffer:	1
behold,	1
the	1
devil	1
shall	1
cast	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
into	1
prison,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
tried;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation	1
ten	1
days:	1
be	1
thou	1
faithful	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
2:11	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Pergamos	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
sharp	1
sword	1
with	1
two	1
edges;	1
2:13	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
dwellest,	1
even	1
where	1
Satan's	1
seat	1
is:	1
and	1
thou	1
holdest	1
fast	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
faith,	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
wherein	1
Antipas	1
was	1
my	1
faithful	1
martyr,	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
among	1
you,	1
where	1
Satan	1
dwelleth.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
there	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
who	1
taught	1
Balac	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication.	1
	1
2:15	1
So	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
thing	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
2:16	1
Repent;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
2:17	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
hidden	1
manna,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
white	1
stone,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stone	1
a	1
new	1
name	1
written,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
saving	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
it.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Thyatira	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
are	1
like	1
fine	1
brass;	1
2:19	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
service,	1
and	1
faith,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
2:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sufferest	1
that	1
woman	1
Jezebel,	1
which	1
calleth	1
herself	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
seduce	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
space	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
her	1
fornication;	1
and	1
she	1
repented	1
not.	1
	1
2:22	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
commit	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
her	1
children	1
with	1
death;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
which	1
searcheth	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
Thyatira,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Satan,	1
as	1
they	1
speak;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
upon	1
you	1
none	1
other	1
burden.	1
	1
2:25	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
already	1
hold	1
fast	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
my	1
works	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
nations:	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron;	1
as	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
a	1
potter	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
shivers:	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
2:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Sardis	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
stars;	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
art	1
dead.	1
	1
3:2	1
Be	1
watchful,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
remain,	1
that	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
thy	1
works	1
perfect	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
hold	1
fast,	1
and	1
repent.	1
If	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
watch,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
on	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
hour	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
few	1
names	1
even	1
in	1
Sardis	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
defiled	1
their	1
garments;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
white:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
blot	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
his	1
name	1
before	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
angels.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Philadelphia	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
David,	1
he	1
that	1
openeth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shutteth;	1
and	1
shutteth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
openeth;	1
3:8	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee	1
an	1
open	1
door,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
shut	1
it:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
little	1
strength,	1
and	1
hast	1
kept	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
3:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan,	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
do	1
lie;	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee.	1
	1
3:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
patience,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
temptation,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
hold	1
that	1
fast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
take	1
thy	1
crown.	1
	1
3:12	1
Him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
my	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
him	1
my	1
new	1
name.	1
	1
3:13	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Amen,	1
the	1
faithful	1
and	1
true	1
witness,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
God;	1
3:15	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot:	1
I	1
would	1
thou	1
wert	1
cold	1
or	1
hot.	1
	1
3:16	1
So	1
then	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
lukewarm,	1
and	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot,	1
I	1
will	1
spue	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:17	1
Because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
am	1
rich,	1
and	1
increased	1
with	1
goods,	1
and	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
nothing;	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wretched,	1
and	1
miserable,	1
and	1
poor,	1
and	1
blind,	1
and	1
naked:	1
3:18	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
to	1
buy	1
of	1
me	1
gold	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
rich;	1
and	1
white	1
raiment,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
clothed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
do	1
not	1
appear;	1
and	1
anoint	1
thine	1
eyes	1
with	1
eyesalve,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see.	1
	1
3:19	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
rebuke	1
and	1
chasten:	1
be	1
zealous	1
therefore,	1
and	1
repent.	1
	1
3:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
knock:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
sup	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
3:21	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
grant	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
throne,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
overcame,	1
and	1
am	1
set	1
down	1
with	1
my	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
3:22	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
4:1	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
talking	1
with	1
me;	1
which	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hereafter.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
immediately	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
spirit:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
throne	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
one	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
and	1
a	1
sardine	1
stone:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rainbow	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
in	1
sight	1
like	1
unto	1
an	1
emerald.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
seats:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
seats	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
sitting,	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
crowns	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
proceeded	1
lightnings	1
and	1
thunderings	1
and	1
voices:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
like	1
unto	1
crystal:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
were	1
four	1
beasts	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
before	1
and	1
behind.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
like	1
a	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
had	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
eagle.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
six	1
wings	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
within:	1
and	1
they	1
rest	1
not	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
saying,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
when	1
those	1
beasts	1
give	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
thanks	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
4:10	1
The	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fall	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
crowns	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
4:11	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
receive	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
power:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
created	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
were	1
created.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
a	1
book	1
written	1
within	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
backside,	1
sealed	1
with	1
seven	1
seals.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
strong	1
angel	1
proclaiming	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof?	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
heaven,	1
nor	1
in	1
earth,	1
neither	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
much,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Weep	1
not:	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lion	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda,	1
the	1
Root	1
of	1
David,	1
hath	1
prevailed	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seven	1
seals	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
stood	1
a	1
Lamb	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
slain,	1
having	1
seven	1
horns	1
and	1
seven	1
eyes,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
book,	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
and	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
having	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
harps,	1
and	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
odours,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof:	1
for	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain,	1
and	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
us	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
thy	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
nation;	1
5:10	1
And	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
kings	1
and	1
priests:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
angels	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
thousands;	1
5:12	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Worthy	1
is	1
the	1
Lamb	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
to	1
receive	1
power,	1
and	1
riches,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
blessing.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
them,	1
heard	1
I	1
saying,	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
power,	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
said,	1
Amen.	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
the	1
Lamb	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seals,	1
and	1
I	1
heard,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thunder,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
saying,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
bow;	1
and	1
a	1
crown	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
conquering,	1
and	1
to	1
conquer.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
another	1
horse	1
that	1
was	1
red:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
thereon	1
to	1
take	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
sword.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
third	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
a	1
black	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
balances	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
say,	1
A	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
and	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
penny;	1
and	1
see	1
thou	1
hurt	1
not	1
the	1
oil	1
and	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fourth	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
pale	1
horse:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
Death,	1
and	1
Hell	1
followed	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
kill	1
with	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fifth	1
seal,	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
they	1
held:	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
How	1
long,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
holy	1
and	1
true,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
judge	1
and	1
avenge	1
our	1
blood	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
white	1
robes	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
rest	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
season,	1
until	1
their	1
fellowservants	1
also	1
and	1
their	1
brethren,	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
sixth	1
seal,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
black	1
as	1
sackcloth	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
became	1
as	1
blood;	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
casteth	1
her	1
untimely	1
figs,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
shaken	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
wind.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
heaven	1
departed	1
as	1
a	1
scroll	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
rolled	1
together;	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
island	1
were	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
every	1
bondman,	1
and	1
every	1
free	1
man,	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
6:16	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
rocks,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
hide	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
6:17	1
For	1
the	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
angels	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
holding	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
should	1
not	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
on	1
any	1
tree.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
ascending	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
having	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
angels,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
hurt	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
7:3	1
Saying,	1
Hurt	1
not	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
the	1
trees,	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
sealed	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
sealed:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
sealed	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1

	1
7:9	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
number,	1
of	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
clothed	1
with	1
white	1
robes,	1
and	1
palms	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
7:10	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Salvation	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
which	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
7:12	1
Saying,	1
Amen:	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
be	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
arrayed	1
in	1
white	1
robes?	1
and	1
whence	1
came	1
they?	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
have	1
washed	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:15	1
Therefore	1
are	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
shall	1
hunger	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
thirst	1
any	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
light	1
on	1
them,	1
nor	1
any	1
heat.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
the	1
Lamb	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
unto	1
living	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters:	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
seventh	1
seal,	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
heaven	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
stood	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
given	1
seven	1
trumpets.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
altar,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
censer;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
much	1
incense,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
all	1
saints	1
upon	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
incense,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
ascended	1
up	1
before	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
took	1
the	1
censer,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
to	1
sound.	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
first	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
hail	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
burnt	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
green	1
grass	1
was	1
burnt	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
burning	1
with	1
fire	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
blood;	1
8:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
had	1
life,	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
destroyed.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
great	1
star	1
from	1
heaven,	1
burning	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
lamp,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
called	1
Wormwood:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
became	1
wormwood;	1
and	1
many	1
men	1
died	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
bitter.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars;	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shone	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
likewise.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
heard	1
an	1
angel	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Woe,	1
woe,	1
woe,	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
sound!	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
star	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
given	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit;	1
and	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
furnace;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
were	1
darkened	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
locusts	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
given	1
power,	1
as	1
the	1
scorpions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
power.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hurt	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
any	1
green	1
thing,	1
neither	1
any	1
tree;	1
but	1
only	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
tormented	1
five	1
months:	1
and	1
their	1
torment	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
scorpion,	1
when	1
he	1
striketh	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
men	1
seek	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
death	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
locusts	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
horses	1
prepared	1
unto	1
battle;	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
crowns	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
hair	1
as	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
their	1
teeth	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
breastplates,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
breastplates	1
of	1
iron;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
chariots	1
of	1
many	1
horses	1
running	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
tails	1
like	1
unto	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
stings	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
and	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
to	1
hurt	1
men	1
five	1
months.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
whose	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
is	1
Abaddon,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
tongue	1
hath	1
his	1
name	1
Apollyon.	1
	1
9:12	1
One	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
come	1
two	1
woes	1
more	1
hereafter.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
God,	1
9:14	1
Saying	1
to	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
Loose	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
were	1
loosed,	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
a	1
year,	1
for	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
thousand:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
them,	1
having	1
breastplates	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
of	1
jacinth,	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
lions;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths	1
issued	1
fire	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
brimstone.	1
	1
9:18	1
By	1
these	1
three	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men	1
killed,	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
brimstone,	1
which	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
for	1
their	1
tails	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
serpents,	1
and	1
had	1
heads,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
do	1
hurt.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
by	1
these	1
plagues	1
yet	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
worship	1
devils,	1
and	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
and	1
stone,	1
and	1
of	1
wood:	1
which	1
neither	1
can	1
see,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
walk:	1
9:21	1
Neither	1
repented	1
they	1
of	1
their	1
murders,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
sorceries,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
fornication,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
thefts.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
mighty	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
cloud:	1
and	1
a	1
rainbow	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
pillars	1
of	1
fire:	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
little	1
book	1
open:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
10:3	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
lion	1
roareth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried,	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
had	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
up	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
heaven,	1
10:6	1
And	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
who	1
created	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
therein,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
time	1
no	1
longer:	1
10:7	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
sound,	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
finished,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
heaven	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
which	1
is	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
standeth	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
little	1
book.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
bitter,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand,	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
it,	1
my	1
belly	1
was	1
bitter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
must	1
prophesy	1
again	1
before	1
many	1
peoples,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
kings.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
reed	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
rod:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
stood,	1
saying,	1
Rise,	1
and	1
measure	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
therein.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
temple	1
leave	1
out,	1
and	1
measure	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
shall	1
they	1
tread	1
under	1
foot	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
power	1
unto	1
my	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days,	1
clothed	1
in	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
11:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
olive	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
candlesticks	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
fire	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
devoureth	1
their	1
enemies:	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
11:6	1
These	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
shut	1
heaven,	1
that	1
it	1
rain	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
prophecy:	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
waters	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
blood,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
all	1
plagues,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
will.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
their	1
testimony,	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
ascendeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
kill	1
them.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
shall	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
spiritually	1
is	1
called	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
where	1
also	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
kindreds	1
and	1
tongues	1
and	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
graves.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
gifts	1
one	1
to	1
another;	1
because	1
these	1
two	1
prophets	1
tormented	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
God	1
entered	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
upon	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
saw	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
in	1
a	1
cloud;	1
and	1
their	1
enemies	1
beheld	1
them.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
fell,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earthquake	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
men	1
seven	1
thousand:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
gave	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:14	1
The	1
second	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
third	1
woe	1
cometh	1
quickly.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
sounded;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
voices	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
become	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
Christ;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders,	1
which	1
sat	1
before	1
God	1
on	1
their	1
seats,	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
11:17	1
Saying,	1
We	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
art	1
to	1
come;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
to	1
thee	1
thy	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
hast	1
reigned.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
angry,	1
and	1
thy	1
wrath	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
judged,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
give	1
reward	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thy	1
name,	1
small	1
and	1
great;	1
and	1
shouldest	1
destroy	1
them	1
which	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
his	1
testament:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
hail.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
great	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
a	1
woman	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
under	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
twelve	1
stars:	1
12:2	1
And	1
she	1
being	1
with	1
child	1
cried,	1
travailing	1
in	1
birth,	1
and	1
pained	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
another	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
red	1
dragon,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
seven	1
crowns	1
upon	1
his	1
heads.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
his	1
tail	1
drew	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
delivered,	1
for	1
to	1
devour	1
her	1
child	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
born.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
rule	1
all	1
nations	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
she	1
hath	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
feed	1
her	1
there	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
heaven:	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
dragon;	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
fought	1
and	1
his	1
angels,	1
12:8	1
And	1
prevailed	1
not;	1
neither	1
was	1
their	1
place	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
dragon	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
called	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
which	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
whole	1
world:	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Now	1
is	1
come	1
salvation,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
Christ:	1
for	1
the	1
accuser	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
is	1
cast	1
down,	1
which	1
accused	1
them	1
before	1
our	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
they	1
overcame	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
their	1
testimony;	1
and	1
they	1
loved	1
not	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
rejoice,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
them.	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
you,	1
having	1
great	1
wrath,	1
because	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dragon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
he	1
persecuted	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
given	1
two	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
eagle,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
fly	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
her	1
place,	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
nourished	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
time,	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
serpent.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
water	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
after	1
the	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
helped	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
flood	1
which	1
the	1
dragon	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
dragon	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
her	1
seed,	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
beast	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horns	1
ten	1
crowns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
heads	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
leopard,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
as	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
lion:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
great	1
authority.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
heads	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wounded	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
his	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
wondered	1
after	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
dragon	1
which	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
beast:	1
and	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
beast?	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
God,	1
to	1
blaspheme	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
overcome	1
them:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
over	1
all	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
nations.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
slain	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:9	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
He	1
that	1
leadeth	1
into	1
captivity	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
must	1
be	1
killed	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
another	1
beast	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
horns	1
like	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
dragon.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
he	1
exerciseth	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
causeth	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
first	1
beast,	1
whose	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
doeth	1
great	1
wonders,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
maketh	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men,	1
13:14	1
And	1
deceiveth	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
those	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
an	1
image	1
to	1
the	1
beast,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
wound	1
by	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
live.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
that	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
both	1
speak,	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
causeth	1
all,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
mark	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads:	1
13:17	1
And	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
buy	1
or	1
sell,	1
save	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
mark,	1
or	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:18	1
Here	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
number	1
is	1
Six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
Lamb	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
having	1
his	1
Father's	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
thunder:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers	1
harping	1
with	1
their	1
harps:	1
14:3	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
learn	1
that	1
song	1
but	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
which	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:4	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
defiled	1
with	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
virgins.	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
follow	1
the	1
Lamb	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
goeth.	1
These	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
among	1
men,	1
being	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
mouth	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
guile:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
fault	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
everlasting	1
gospel	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
nation,	1
and	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
14:7	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Fear	1
God,	1
and	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
judgment	1
is	1
come:	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
another	1
angel,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
because	1
she	1
made	1
all	1
nations	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
followed	1
them,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
mark	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
14:10	1
The	1
same	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
without	1
mixture	1
into	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
indignation;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
torment	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
nor	1
night,	1
who	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
receiveth	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
14:12	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
the	1
saints:	1
here	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
henceforth:	1
Yea,	1
saith	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
labours;	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
do	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
cloud,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cloud	1
one	1
sat	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
having	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
golden	1
crown,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
crying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sickle,	1
and	1
reap:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
reap;	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
reaped.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
he	1
also	1
having	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
fire;	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
cry	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
saying,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clusters	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
her	1
grapes	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
winepress	1
was	1
trodden	1
without	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
blood	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
winepress,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
horse	1
bridles,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
furlongs.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
sign	1
in	1
heaven,	1
great	1
and	1
marvellous,	1
seven	1
angels	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
mingled	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
gotten	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
mark,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
glass,	1
having	1
the	1
harps	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
they	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
and	1
marvellous	1
are	1
thy	1
works,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty;	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
are	1
thy	1
ways,	1
thou	1
King	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
15:4	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
and	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name?	1
for	1
thou	1
only	1
art	1
holy:	1
for	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
made	1
manifest.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened:	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues,	1
clothed	1
in	1
pure	1
and	1
white	1
linen,	1
and	1
having	1
their	1
breasts	1
girded	1
with	1
golden	1
girdles.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
seven	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
power;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
till	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
angels,	1
Go	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
vials	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
went,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
noisome	1
and	1
grievous	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man:	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
soul	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
rivers	1
and	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
blood.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
righteous,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
judged	1
thus.	1
	1
16:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
saints	1
and	1
prophets,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
blood	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
say,	1
Even	1
so,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
scorch	1
men	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
men	1
were	1
scorched	1
with	1
great	1
heat,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
plagues:	1
and	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
glory.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
darkness;	1
and	1
they	1
gnawed	1
their	1
tongues	1
for	1
pain,	1
16:11	1
And	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
pains	1
and	1
their	1
sores,	1
and	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates;	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
thereof	1
was	1
dried	1
up,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
might	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
three	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
like	1
frogs	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
dragon,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
false	1
prophet.	1
	1
16:14	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
devils,	1
working	1
miracles,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty.	1
	1
16:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
watcheth,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
garments,	1
lest	1
he	1
walk	1
naked,	1
and	1
they	1
see	1
his	1
shame.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Armageddon.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
heaven,	1
from	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunders,	1
and	1
lightnings;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
men	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
so	1
great.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
parts,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
Babylon	1
came	1
in	1
remembrance	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
every	1
island	1
fled	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
not	1
found.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
men	1
a	1
great	1
hail	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
every	1
stone	1
about	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
a	1
talent:	1
and	1
men	1
blasphemed	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
hail;	1
for	1
the	1
plague	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceeding	1
great.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Come	1
hither;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whore	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
many	1
waters:	1
17:2	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
drunk	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
17:3	1
So	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
sit	1
upon	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coloured	1
beast,	1
full	1
of	1
names	1
of	1
blasphemy,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
arrayed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
scarlet	1
colour,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
and	1
pearls,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
cup	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
full	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
filthiness	1
of	1
her	1
fornication:	1
17:5	1
And	1
upon	1
her	1
forehead	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
MYSTERY,	1
BABYLON	1
THE	1
GREAT,	1
THE	1
MOTHER	1
OF	1
HARLOTS	1
AND	1
ABOMINATIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
EARTH.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
woman	1
drunken	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
I	1
wondered	1
with	1
great	1
admiration.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
marvel?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
carrieth	1
her,	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:8	1
The	1
beast	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
ascend	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
perdition:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wonder,	1
whose	1
names	1
were	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
when	1
they	1
behold	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
yet	1
is.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
hath	1
wisdom.	1
The	1
seven	1
heads	1
are	1
seven	1
mountains,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
woman	1
sitteth.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
kings:	1
five	1
are	1
fallen,	1
and	1
one	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
must	1
continue	1
a	1
short	1
space.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
even	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
eighth,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
seven,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
perdition.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
ten	1
kings,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
kingdom	1
as	1
yet;	1
but	1
receive	1
power	1
as	1
kings	1
one	1
hour	1
with	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:13	1
These	1
have	1
one	1
mind,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
power	1
and	1
strength	1
unto	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:14	1
These	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords,	1
and	1
King	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
called,	1
and	1
chosen,	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
waters	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
where	1
the	1
whore	1
sitteth,	1
are	1
peoples,	1
and	1
multitudes,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
upon	1
the	1
beast,	1
these	1
shall	1
hate	1
the	1
whore,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
desolate	1
and	1
naked,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
burn	1
her	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
17:17	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
fulfil	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
to	1
agree,	1
and	1
give	1
their	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
the	1
beast,	1
until	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
is	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
reigneth	1
over	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
great	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
lightened	1
with	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
mightily	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
the	1
great	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
devils,	1
and	1
the	1
hold	1
of	1
every	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
cage	1
of	1
every	1
unclean	1
and	1
hateful	1
bird.	1
	1
18:3	1
For	1
all	1
nations	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
waxed	1
rich	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
delicacies.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
partakers	1
of	1
her	1
sins,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
plagues.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
her	1
sins	1
have	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
remembered	1
her	1
iniquities.	1
	1
18:6	1
Reward	1
her	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
rewarded	1
you,	1
and	1
double	1
unto	1
her	1
double	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
works:	1
in	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
she	1
hath	1
filled	1
fill	1
to	1
her	1
double.	1
	1
18:7	1
How	1
much	1
she	1
hath	1
glorified	1
herself,	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously,	1
so	1
much	1
torment	1
and	1
sorrow	1
give	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
saith	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
sit	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
widow,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
sorrow.	1
	1
18:8	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
her	1
plagues	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
death,	1
and	1
mourning,	1
and	1
famine;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
for	1
strong	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
who	1
judgeth	1
her.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously	1
with	1
her,	1
shall	1
bewail	1
her,	1
and	1
lament	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
18:10	1
Standing	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
mighty	1
city!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
thy	1
judgment	1
come.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
mourn	1
over	1
her;	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
buyeth	1
their	1
merchandise	1
any	1
more:	1
18:12	1
The	1
merchandise	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
of	1
pearls,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
silk,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
all	1
thyine	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
most	1
precious	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
marble,	1
18:13	1
And	1
cinnamon,	1
and	1
odours,	1
and	1
ointments,	1
and	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
wheat,	1
and	1
beasts,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
slaves,	1
and	1
souls	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
the	1
fruits	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusted	1
after	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
dainty	1
and	1
goodly	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
them	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
merchants	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
by	1
her,	1
shall	1
stand	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
18:16	1
And	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
that	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pearls!	1
	1
18:17	1
For	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
so	1
great	1
riches	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
And	1
every	1
shipmaster,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
ships,	1
and	1
sailors,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
trade	1
by	1
sea,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
18:18	1
And	1
cried	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
saying,	1
What	1
city	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city!	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
dust	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
cried,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
ships	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
costliness!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
she	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
18:20	1
Rejoice	1
over	1
her,	1
thou	1
heaven,	1
and	1
ye	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
avenged	1
you	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
angel	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stone	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
millstone,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
with	1
violence	1
shall	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon	1
be	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers,	1
and	1
musicians,	1
and	1
of	1
pipers,	1
and	1
trumpeters,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
no	1
craftsman,	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
craft	1
he	1
be,	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
18:23	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
shall	1
shine	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee:	1
for	1
thy	1
merchants	1
were	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
by	1
thy	1
sorceries	1
were	1
all	1
nations	1
deceived.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
of	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia;	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God:	1
19:2	1
For	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
his	1
judgments:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
judged	1
the	1
great	1
whore,	1
which	1
did	1
corrupt	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
hath	1
avenged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
said,	1
Alleluia	1
And	1
her	1
smoke	1
rose	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Amen;	1
Alleluia.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Praise	1
our	1
God,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mighty	1
thunderings,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
omnipotent	1
reigneth.	1
	1
19:7	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
give	1
honour	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hath	1
made	1
herself	1
ready.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
granted	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
arrayed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
clean	1
and	1
white:	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
linen	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
sayings	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
worship	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
called	1
Faithful	1
and	1
True,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness	1
he	1
doth	1
judge	1
and	1
make	1
war.	1
	1
19:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
many	1
crowns;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
knew,	1
but	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
vesture	1
dipped	1
in	1
blood:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
Word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
heaven	1
followed	1
him	1
upon	1
white	1
horses,	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
white	1
and	1
clean.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword,	1
that	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
the	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
he	1
treadeth	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
and	1
wrath	1
of	1
Almighty	1
God.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
on	1
his	1
vesture	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
thigh	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
KING	1
OF	1
KINGS,	1
AND	1
LORD	1
OF	1
LORDS.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
that	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
Come	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God;	1
19:18	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
both	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
armies,	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
that	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
deceived	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
These	1
both	1
were	1
cast	1
alive	1
into	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
with	1
brimstone.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
horse,	1
which	1
sword	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
chain	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
dragon,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
20:3	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
no	1
more,	1
till	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
loosed	1
a	1
little	1
season.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
thrones,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
beheaded	1
for	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
neither	1
his	1
image,	1
neither	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
mark	1
upon	1
their	1
foreheads,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
reigned	1
with	1
Christ	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:5	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
lived	1
not	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
were	1
finished.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:6	1
Blessed	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection:	1
on	1
such	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
power,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
priests	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
shall	1
reign	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
are	1
expired,	1
Satan	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
prison,	1
20:8	1
And	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Gog,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
battle:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
beloved	1
city:	1
and	1
fire	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
deceived	1
them	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone,	1
where	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
are,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
throne,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
it,	1
from	1
whose	1
face	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
fled	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dead,	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
stand	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened:	1
and	1
another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
were	1
judged	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
books,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
judged	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
whosoever	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
heaven	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
earth	1
were	1
passed	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sea.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
prepared	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
death,	1
neither	1
sorrow,	1
nor	1
crying,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
pain:	1
for	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
new.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write:	1
for	1
these	1
words	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
21:7	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
inherit	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:8	1
But	1
the	1
fearful,	1
and	1
unbelieving,	1
and	1
the	1
abominable,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
all	1
liars,	1
shall	1
have	1
their	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
burneth	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
the	1
holy	1
Jerusalem,	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
God,	1
21:11	1
Having	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
her	1
light	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
stone	1
most	1
precious,	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
stone,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal;	1
21:12	1
And	1
had	1
a	1
wall	1
great	1
and	1
high,	1
and	1
had	1
twelve	1
gates,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
twelve	1
angels,	1
and	1
names	1
written	1
thereon,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
21:13	1
On	1
the	1
east	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
three	1
gates;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
three	1
gates.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
twelve	1
foundations,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
had	1
a	1
golden	1
reed	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
lieth	1
foursquare,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
is	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
breadth:	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
reed,	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
furlongs.	1
	1
The	1
length	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
equal.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
cubits,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
jasper:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
like	1
unto	1
clear	1
glass.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
were	1
garnished	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
stones.	1
The	1
first	1
foundation	1
was	1
jasper;	1
the	1
second,	1
sapphire;	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
chalcedony;	1
the	1
fourth,	1
an	1
emerald;	1
21:20	1
The	1
fifth,	1
sardonyx;	1
the	1
sixth,	1
sardius;	1
the	1
seventh,	1
chrysolyte;	1
the	1
eighth,	1
beryl;	1
the	1
ninth,	1
a	1
topaz;	1
the	1
tenth,	1
a	1
chrysoprasus;	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
a	1
jacinth;	1
the	1
twelfth,	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
the	1
twelve	1
gates	1
were	1
twelve	1
pearls:	1
every	1
several	1
gate	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
pearl:	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
transparent	1
glass.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
temple	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
lighten	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
bring	1
their	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
day:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
into	1
it	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
defileth,	1
neither	1
whatsoever	1
worketh	1
abomination,	1
or	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie:	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
a	1
pure	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
life,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal,	1
proceeding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
22:2	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
bare	1
twelve	1
manner	1
of	1
fruits,	1
and	1
yielded	1
her	1
fruit	1
every	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
healing	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
curse:	1
but	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
22:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
need	1
no	1
candle,	1
neither	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
giveth	1
them	1
light:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
sayings	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
true:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
shewed	1
me	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
worship	1
God.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
not	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
22:11	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unjust,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unjust	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
filthy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
filthy	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
righteous	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
holy	1
still.	1
	1
22:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly;	1
and	1
my	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
me,	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
his	1
work	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
22:13	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
22:14	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
may	1
enter	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
without	1
are	1
dogs,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
loveth	1
and	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
22:16	1
I	1
Jesus	1
have	1
sent	1
mine	1
angel	1
to	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
churches.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

offspring	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
and	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
heareth	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
come.	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1

If	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
these	1
things,	1
God	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
plagues	1
that	1
are	1
written	1

22:19	1

man	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
words	1

	1
22:20	1
He	1
which	1
testifieth	1
these	1
things	1
saith,	1
Surely	1
I	1
come	1
quickly.	1
Amen.	1
	1

Night.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
day.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
firmament	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
divide	1
the	1
waters	1
from	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
firmament,	1
and	1
divided	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
firmament	1
from	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
were	1
above	1
the	1
firmament:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
God	1
called	1
the	1
firmament	1
Heaven.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
second	1
day.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
waters	1
under	1
the	1
heaven	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
appear:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
God	1
called	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
Earth;	1
and	1
the	1
gathering	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
called	1
he	1
Seas:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
earth	1
bring	1
forth	1
grass,	1
the	1
herb	1
yielding	1
seed,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
tree	1
yielding	1
fruit	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
whose	1
seed	1
is	1
in	1
itself,	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
grass,	1
and	1
herb	1
yielding	1
seed	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
the	1
tree	1
yielding	1
fruit,	1
whose	1
seed	1
was	1
in	1
itself,	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
signs,	1
and	1
for	1
seasons,	1
and	1
for	1
days,	1
and	1
years:	1
1:15	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
for	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
two	1
great	1
lights;	1
the	1
greater	1
light	1
to	1
rule	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
lesser	1
light	1
to	1
rule	1
the	1
night:	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
stars	1
also.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
God	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
firmament	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
to	1
give	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
1:18	1
And	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
darkness:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
fourth	1
day.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
waters	1
bring	1
forth	1
abundantly	1
the	1
moving	1
creature	1
that	1
hath	1
life,	1
and	1
fowl	1
that	1
may	1
fly	1
above	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
firmament	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
God	1
created	1
great	1
whales,	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
moveth,	1
which	1
the	1
waters	1
brought	1
forth	1
abundantly,	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
winged	1
fowl	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
fill	1
the	1
waters	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
let	1
fowl	1
multiply	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
fifth	1
day.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
earth	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
cattle,	1
and	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind:	1
and	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
good.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
image,	1
after	1
our	1
likeness:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
over	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:27	1
So	1
God	1
created	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
image,	1
in	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
created	1
he	1
him;	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
created	1
he	1
them.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
replenish	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
subdue	1
it:	1
and	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
over	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
moveth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
every	1
herb	1
bearing	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
tree,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
yielding	1
seed;	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
meat.	1
	1
1:30	1
And	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
life,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
every	1
green	1
herb	1
for	1
meat:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
good.	1
And	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
were	1
the	1
sixth	1
day.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thus	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
finished,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
God	1
ended	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made;	1
and	1
he	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
it:	1
because	1
that	1
in	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
rested	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
God	1
created	1
and	1
made.	1
	1
2:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
created,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
made	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heavens,	1
2:5	1
And	1
every	1
plant	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
it	1
grew:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
not	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
a	1
mist	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
whole	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
formed	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
breathed	1
into	1
his	1
nostrils	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
man	1
became	1
a	1
living	1
soul.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
planted	1
a	1
garden	1
eastward	1
in	1
Eden;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
formed.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
made	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
to	1
grow	1
every	1
tree	1
that	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
sight,	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
food;	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
a	1
river	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
water	1
the	1
garden;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
it	1
was	1
parted,	1
and	1
became	1
into	1
four	1
heads.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
Pison:	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
compasseth	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
of	1
Havilah,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
gold;	1
2:12	1
And	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
is	1
good:	1
there	1
is	1
bdellium	1
and	1
the	1
onyx	1
stone.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
river	1
is	1
Gihon:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
compasseth	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
of	1
Ethiopia.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
river	1
is	1
Hiddekel:	1
that	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
goeth	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
river	1
is	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
took	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
to	1
dress	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
commanded	1
the	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
thou	1
mayest	1
freely	1
eat:	1
2:17	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
good	1
and	1
evil,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
eatest	1
thereof	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
alone;	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
help	1
meet	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
formed	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
Adam	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
them:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
Adam	1
called	1
every	1
living	1
creature,	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Adam	1
gave	1
names	1
to	1
all	1
cattle,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
but	1
for	1
Adam	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
an	1
help	1
meet	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
caused	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
Adam,	1
and	1
he	1
slept:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
ribs,	1
and	1
closed	1
up	1
the	1
flesh	1
instead	1
thereof;	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
rib,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
man,	1
made	1
he	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
unto	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
Adam	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
bone	1
of	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
flesh:	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
Woman,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
Man.	1
	1
2:24	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
cleave	1
unto	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
naked,	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
the	1
serpent	1
was	1
more	1
subtil	1
than	1
any	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
had	1
made.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Yea,	1
hath	1
God	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
garden?	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
serpent,	1
We	1
may	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden:	1
3:3	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
touch	1
it,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
surely	1
die:	1
3:5	1
For	1
God	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
then	1
your	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
gods,	1
knowing	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
tree	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
food,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
tree	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
wise,	1
she	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
unto	1
her	1
husband	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
naked;	1
and	1
they	1
sewed	1
fig	1
leaves	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
themselves	1
aprons.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
and	1
Adam	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hid	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
amongst	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
called	1
unto	1
Adam,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
naked;	1
and	1
I	1
hid	1
myself.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
told	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wast	1
naked?	1
Hast	1
thou	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
whereof	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
eat?	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said,	1
The	1
woman	1
whom	1
thou	1
gavest	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
The	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
serpent,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this,	1
thou	1
art	1
cursed	1
above	1
all	1
cattle,	1
and	1
above	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
upon	1
thy	1
belly	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go,	1
and	1
dust	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life:	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
enmity	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
between	1
thy	1
seed	1
and	1
her	1
seed;	1
it	1
shall	1
bruise	1
thy	1
head,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bruise	1
his	1
heel.	1
	1
3:16	1
Unto	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
greatly	1
multiply	1
thy	1
sorrow	1
and	1
thy	1
conception;	1
in	1
sorrow	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
forth	1
children;	1
and	1
thy	1
desire	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
thee.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
unto	1
Adam	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
hast	1
eaten	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
it:	1
cursed	1
is	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
thy	1
sake;	1
in	1
sorrow	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
life;	1
3:18	1
Thorns	1
also	1
and	1
thistles	1
shall	1
it	1
bring	1
forth	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
the	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
3:19	1
In	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
thy	1
face	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
bread,	1
till	1
thou	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
ground;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
wast	1
thou	1
taken:	1
for	1
dust	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
unto	1
dust	1
shalt	1
thou	1
return.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
Adam	1
called	1
his	1
wife's	1
name	1
Eve;	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
all	1
living.	1
	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
Adam	1
also	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
make	1
coats	1
of	1
skins,	1
and	1
clothed	1
them.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
become	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
us,	1
to	1
know	1
good	1
and	1
evil:	1
and	1
now,	1
lest	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
eat,	1
and	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
3:23	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden,	1
to	1
till	1
the	1
ground	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
3:24	1
So	1
he	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
Cherubims,	1
and	1
a	1
flaming	1
sword	1
which	1
turned	1
every	1
way,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
Adam	1
knew	1
Eve	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Cain,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
gotten	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
she	1
again	1
bare	1
his	1
brother	1
Abel.	1
And	1
Abel	1
was	1
a	1
keeper	1
of	1
sheep,	1
but	1
Cain	1
was	1
a	1
tiller	1
of	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
Cain	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Abel,	1
he	1
also	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
firstlings	1
of	1
his	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
thereof.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
Abel	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
offering:	1
4:5	1
But	1
unto	1
Cain	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
offering	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
respect.	1
And	1
Cain	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
fell.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Cain,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
wroth?	1
and	1
why	1
is	1
thy	1
countenance	1
fallen?	1
	1
4:7	1
If	1
thou	1
doest	1
well,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
accepted?	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
doest	1
not	1
well,	1
sin	1
lieth	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
And	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
desire,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rule	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Cain	1
talked	1
with	1
Abel	1
his	1
brother:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
Cain	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
Abel	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Cain,	1
Where	1
is	1
Abel	1
thy	1
brother?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
Am	1
I	1
my	1
brother's	1
keeper?	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's	1
blood	1
crieth	1
unto	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
now	1
art	1
thou	1
cursed	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
hath	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth	1
to	1
receive	1
thy	1
brother's	1
blood	1
from	1
thy	1
hand;	1
4:12	1
When	1
thou	1
tillest	1
the	1
ground,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
henceforth	1
yield	1
unto	1
thee	1
her	1
strength;	1
a	1
fugitive	1
and	1
a	1
vagabond	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
Cain	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
My	1
punishment	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
bear.	1
	1
4:14	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
driven	1
me	1
out	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
face	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
hid;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fugitive	1
and	1
a	1
vagabond	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
findeth	1
me	1
shall	1
slay	1
me.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
slayeth	1
Cain,	1
vengeance	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
on	1
him	1
sevenfold.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
set	1
a	1
mark	1
upon	1
Cain,	1
lest	1
any	1
finding	1
him	1
should	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
Cain	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nod,	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Eden.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
Cain	1
knew	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Enoch:	1
and	1
he	1
builded	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
son,	1
Enoch.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
unto	1
Enoch	1
was	1
born	1
Irad:	1
and	1
Irad	1
begat	1
Mehujael:	1
and	1
Mehujael	1
begat	1
Methusael:	1
and	1
Methusael	1
begat	1
Lamech.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
Lamech	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
wives:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Adah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Zillah.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
Adah	1
bare	1
Jabal:	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
dwell	1
in	1
tents,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
cattle.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
his	1
brother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jubal:	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
handle	1
the	1
harp	1
and	1
organ.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
Zillah,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
Tubalcain,	1
an	1
instructer	1
of	1
every	1
artificer	1
in	1
brass	1
and	1
iron:	1
and	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Tubalcain	1
was	1
Naamah.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
Lamech	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
wives,	1
Adah	1
and	1
Zillah,	1
Hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
ye	1
wives	1
of	1
Lamech,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
speech:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
my	1
wounding,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
my	1
hurt.	1
	1
4:24	1
If	1
Cain	1
shall	1
be	1
avenged	1
sevenfold,	1
truly	1
Lamech	1
seventy	1
and	1
sevenfold.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
Adam	1
knew	1
his	1
wife	1
again;	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Seth:	1
For	1
God,	1
said	1
she,	1
hath	1
appointed	1
me	1
another	1
seed	1
instead	1
of	1
Abel,	1
whom	1
Cain	1
slew.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
to	1
Seth,	1
to	1
him	1
also	1
there	1
was	1
born	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Enos:	1
then	1
began	1
men	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Adam.	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1

toil	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1

of	1
the	1

	1
5:30	1

	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
men	1
began	1
to	1
multiply	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
daughters	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
them,	1
6:2	1
That	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
saw	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
fair;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
all	1
which	1
they	1
chose.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
My	1
spirit	1
shall	1
not	1
always	1
strive	1
with	1
man,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
flesh:	1
yet	1
his	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
6:4	1
There	1
were	1
giants	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
those	1
days;	1
and	1
also	1
after	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
children	1
to	1
them,	1
the	1
same	1
became	1
mighty	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
men	1
of	1
renown.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
only	1
evil	1
continually.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
it	1
repented	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
grieved	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
created	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
both	1
man,	1
and	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air;	1
for	1
it	1
repenteth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
them.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
Noah	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Noah:	1
Noah	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
perfect	1
in	1
his	1
generations,	1
and	1
Noah	1
walked	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Noah	1
begat	1
three	1
sons,	1
Shem,	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth.	1
	1
6:11	1
The	1
earth	1
also	1
was	1
corrupt	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
violence.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
God	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
corrupt;	1
for	1
all	1
flesh	1
had	1
corrupted	1
his	1
way	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
come	1
before	1
me;	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
filled	1
with	1
violence	1
through	1
them;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:14	1
Make	1
thee	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
gopher	1
wood;	1
rooms	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
shalt	1
pitch	1
it	1
within	1
and	1
without	1
with	1
pitch.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fashion	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
of:	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
shall	1
be	1
three	1
hundred	1
cubits,	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
it	1
fifty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
thirty	1
cubits.	1
	1
6:16	1
A	1
window	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
to	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cubit	1
shalt	1
thou	1
finish	1
it	1
above;	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
thereof;	1
with	1
lower,	1
second,	1
and	1
third	1
stories	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
6:17	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
do	1
bring	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
waters	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
flesh,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life,	1
from	1
under	1
heaven;	1
and	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
6:18	1
But	1
with	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
two	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
alive	1
with	1
thee;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
male	1
and	1
female.	1
	1
6:20	1
Of	1
fowls	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
two	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
alive.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
take	1
thou	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
food	1
that	1
is	1
eaten,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gather	1
it	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
food	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
6:22	1
Thus	1
did	1
Noah;	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
Come	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
into	1
the	1
ark;	1
for	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
righteous	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
7:2	1
Of	1
every	1
clean	1
beast	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
sevens,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
his	1
female:	1
and	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
clean	1
by	1
two,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
his	1
female.	1
	1
7:3	1
Of	1
fowls	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
sevens,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
the	1
female;	1
to	1
keep	1
seed	1
alive	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
yet	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights;	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
substance	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
Noah	1
did	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Noah	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
waters	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
Noah	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
him,	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
7:8	1
Of	1
clean	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
clean,	1
and	1
of	1
fowls,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
7:9	1
There	1
went	1
in	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
unto	1
Noah	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
the	1
male	1
and	1
the	1
female,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
Noah.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
seven	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
flood	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:11	1
In	1
the	1
six	1
hundredth	1
year	1
of	1
Noah's	1
life,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
deep	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven	1
were	1
opened.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights.	1
	1
7:13	1
In	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
entered	1
Noah,	1
and	1
Shem,	1
and	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
and	1
Noah's	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
wives	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
them,	1
into	1
the	1
ark;	1
7:14	1
They,	1
and	1
every	1
beast	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
after	1
their	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
every	1
bird	1
of	1
every	1
sort.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Noah	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
in,	1
went	1
in	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shut	1
him	1
in.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
the	1
flood	1
was	1
forty	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
increased,	1
and	1
bare	1
up	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
lift	1
up	1
above	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed,	1
and	1
were	1
increased	1
greatly	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
went	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed	1
exceedingly	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
high	1
hills,	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
were	1
covered.	1
	1
7:20	1
Fifteen	1
cubits	1
upward	1
did	1
the	1
waters	1
prevail;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
covered.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
died	1
that	1
moved	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
both	1
of	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
man:	1
7:22	1
All	1
in	1
whose	1
nostrils	1
was	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
life,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
died.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
every	1
living	1
substance	1
was	1
destroyed	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
both	1
man,	1
and	1
cattle,	1
and	1
the	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
heaven;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
destroyed	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Noah	1
only	1
remained	1
alive,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
days.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
God	1
remembered	1
Noah,	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
thing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ark:	1
and	1
God	1
made	1
a	1
wind	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
asswaged;	1
8:2	1
The	1
fountains	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven	1
were	1
stopped,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven	1
was	1
restrained;	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
returned	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth	1
continually:	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
days	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Ararat.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
decreased	1
continually	1
until	1
the	1
tenth	1
month:	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
were	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
seen.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
forty	1
days,	1
that	1
Noah	1
opened	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made:	1
8:7	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
raven,	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
until	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:8	1
Also	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
dove	1
from	1
him,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground;	1
8:9	1
But	1
the	1
dove	1
found	1
no	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
her	1
foot,	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
then	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
pulled	1
her	1
in	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
stayed	1
yet	1
other	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
dove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
dove	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
her	1
mouth	1
was	1
an	1
olive	1
leaf	1
pluckt	1
off:	1
so	1
Noah	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
abated	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
stayed	1
yet	1
other	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
dove;	1
which	1
returned	1
not	1
again	1
unto	1
him	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
six	1
hundredth	1
and	1
first	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Noah	1
removed	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
dry.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
was	1
the	1
earth	1
dried.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
saying,	1
8:16	1
Go	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
8:17	1
Bring	1
forth	1
with	1
thee	1
every	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
both	1
of	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
breed	1
abundantly	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
Noah	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
wives	1
with	1
him:	1
8:19	1
Every	1
beast,	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
and	1
every	1
fowl,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
after	1
their	1
kinds,	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Noah	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
every	1
clean	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
clean	1
fowl,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
smelled	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
curse	1
the	1
ground	1
any	1
more	1
for	1
man's	1
sake;	1
for	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
man's	1
heart	1
is	1
evil	1
from	1
his	1
youth;	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
again	1
smite	1
any	1
more	1
every	1
thing	1
living,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
8:22	1
While	1
the	1
earth	1
remaineth,	1
seedtime	1
and	1
harvest,	1
and	1
cold	1
and	1
heat,	1
and	1
summer	1
and	1
winter,	1
and	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
shall	1
not	1
cease.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
God	1
blessed	1
Noah	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply,	1
and	1
replenish	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
fowl	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
moveth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
into	1
your	1
hand	1
are	1
they	1
delivered.	1
	1
9:3	1
Every	1
moving	1
thing	1
that	1
liveth	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
you;	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
you	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
9:4	1
But	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
life	1
thereof,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
eat.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
surely	1
your	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
lives	1
will	1
I	1
require;	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
beast	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
it,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man;	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
every	1
man's	1
brother	1
will	1
I	1
require	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
Whoso	1
sheddeth	1
man's	1
blood,	1
by	1
man	1
shall	1
his	1
blood	1
be	1
shed:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God	1
made	1
he	1
man.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply;	1
bring	1
forth	1
abundantly	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
multiply	1
therein.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
saying,	1
9:9	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
seed	1
after	1
you;	1
9:10	1
And	1
with	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
of	1
the	1
fowl,	1
of	1
the	1
cattle,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
you;	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
to	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
neither	1
shall	1
all	1
flesh	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
any	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
a	1
flood;	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
a	1
flood	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
perpetual	1
generations:	1
9:13	1
I	1
do	1
set	1
my	1
bow	1
in	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
a	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
bring	1
a	1
cloud	1
over	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
cloud:	1
9:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant,	1
which	1
is	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
of	1
all	1
flesh;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
become	1
a	1
flood	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
flesh.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
cloud;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
remember	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Noah,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
established	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
that	1
went	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
were	1
Shem,	1
and	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth:	1
and	1
Ham	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
9:19	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
overspread.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
Noah	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
husbandman,	1
and	1
he	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard:	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
drank	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
was	1
drunken;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
uncovered	1
within	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Ham,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
saw	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
two	1
brethren	1
without.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Shem	1
and	1
Japheth	1
took	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
both	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
their	1
father;	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
backward,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
not	1
their	1
father's	1
nakedness.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
Noah	1
awoke	1
from	1
his	1
wine,	1
and	1
knew	1
what	1
his	1
younger	1
son	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
Canaan;	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
servants	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Shem;	1
and	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
9:27	1
God	1
shall	1
enlarge	1
Japheth,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Shem;	1
and	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
Noah	1
lived	1
after	1
the	1
flood	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah	1
were	1
nine	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years:	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
Shem,	1
Ham,	1
and	1
Japheth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
sons	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
10:2	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Japheth;	1
Gomer,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
and	1
Madai,	1
and	1
Javan,	1
and	1
Tubal,	1
and	1
Meshech,	1
and	1
Tiras.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gomer;	1
Ashkenaz,	1
and	1
Riphath,	1
and	1
Togarmah.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Javan;	1
Elishah,	1
and	1
Tarshish,	1
Kittim,	1
and	1
Dodanim.	1
	1
10:5	1
By	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
divided	1
in	1
their	1
lands;	1
every	1
one	1
after	1
his	1
tongue,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
in	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ham;	1
Cush,	1
and	1
Mizraim,	1
and	1
Phut,	1
and	1
Canaan.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Cush;	1
Seba,	1
and	1
Havilah,	1
and	1
Sabtah,	1
and	1
Raamah,	1
and	1
Sabtechah:	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Raamah;	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Dedan.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1

a	1
mighty	1
one	1

	1
10:9	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
Even	1
as	1
Nimrod	1
the	1
mighty	1
hunter	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1

and	1
Erech,	1
and	1
Accad,	1
and	1

	1
10:11	1
Out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
went	1
forth	1

and	1
builded	1
Nineveh,	1
and	1
the	1

10:12	1
And	1
Resen	1

Nineveh	1
and	1

the	1

is	1
a	1
great	1
city.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1

afterward	1
were	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
spread	1
abroad.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
was	1
from	1
Sidon,	1
as	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
Gerar,	1
unto	1
Gaza;	1
as	1
thou	1

unto	1
Sodom,	1

Gomorrah,	1
and	1
Admah,	1
and	1

	1
10:20	1
These	1

of	1
Ham,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
after	1
their	1

in	1

	1
10:21	1
Unto	1

of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Eber,	1
the	1

of	1
Japheth	1
the	1

The	1

of	1
Shem;	1

and	1
Asshur,	1
and	1

and	1

And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aram;	1
Uz,	1
and	1
Hul,	1
and	1
Gether,	1
and	1
Mash.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Arphaxad	1
begat	1
Salah;	1
and	1
Salah	1
begat	1
Eber.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
unto	1
Eber	1
were	1
born	1
two	1
sons:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
one	1
was	1
Peleg;	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
days	1
was	1
the	1
earth	1
divided;	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
name	1
was	1
Joktan.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
Joktan	1
begat	1
Almodad,	1
and	1
Sheleph,	1
and	1

10:29	1
And	1
Ophir,	1
and	1
Havilah,	1
and	1
Jobab:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joktan.	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
their	1
dwelling	1
was	1
from	1
Mesha,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
unto	1
Sephar	1
a	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
10:31	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shem,	1
after	1
their	1
families,	1
after	1
their	1
tongues,	1
in	1
their	1
lands,	1
after	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
10:32	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Noah,	1
after	1
their	1
generations,	1
in	1
their	1
nations:	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
nations	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
after	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
language,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
speech.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
plain	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar;	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
brick,	1
and	1
burn	1
them	1
thoroughly.	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
brick	1
for	1
stone,	1
and	1
slime	1
had	1
they	1
for	1
morter.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
build	1
us	1
a	1
city	1
and	1
a	1
tower,	1
whose	1
top	1
may	1
reach	1
unto	1
heaven;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
us	1
a	1
name,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
tower,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
builded.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
all	1
one	1
language;	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
do:	1
and	1
now	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
restrained	1
from	1
them,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
imagined	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
11:7	1
Go	1
to,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
there	1
confound	1
their	1
language,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
another's	1
speech.	1
	1
11:8	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
scattered	1
them	1
abroad	1
from	1
thence	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:9	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
called	1
Babel;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
there	1
confound	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
scatter	1
them	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:10	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Shem:	1
Shem	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
begat	1
Arphaxad	1
two	1
years	1
after	1

	1
11:16	1
And	1
Eber	1
lived	1
four	1
and	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Peleg:	1
11:17	1
And	1
Eber	1
lived	1

Peleg	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1

	1
11:18	1
And	1
Peleg	1
lived	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Reu:	1
11:19	1
And	1
Peleg	1
lived	1
after	1
he	1
begat	1
Reu	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
nine	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
Reu	1
lived	1
two	1
and	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Serug:	1
11:21	1
And	1
Reu	1
lived	1
after	1
he	1
begat	1
Serug	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
seven	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1

	1
11:22	1
And	1
Serug	1
lived	1
thirty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Nahor:	1
11:23	1
And	1
Serug	1
lived	1
after	1
he	1
begat	1

two	1
hundred	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1

	1
11:24	1
And	1
Nahor	1
lived	1
nine	1
and	1
twenty	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Terah:	1
11:25	1
And	1
Nahor	1
lived	1
after	1
he	1
begat	1
Terah	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
nineteen	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1

	1
11:26	1
And	1
Terah	1
lived	1
seventy	1
years,	1
and	1
begat	1
Abram,	1
Nahor,	1
and	1
Haran.	1
	1
11:27	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Terah:	1
Terah	1
begat	1
Abram,	1
Nahor,	1
and	1
Haran;	1
and	1
Haran	1
begat	1
Lot.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
Haran	1
died	1
before	1
his	1
father	1
Terah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
nativity,	1
in	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Abram	1
and	1
Nahor	1
took	1
them	1
wives:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
was	1
Sarai;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Nahor's	1
wife,	1
Milcah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Haran,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Iscah.	1
	1
11:30	1
But	1
Sarai	1
was	1
barren;	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
Terah	1
took	1
Abram	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
Lot	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haran	1
his	1
son's	1
son,	1
and	1
Sarai	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
his	1
son	1
Abram's	1
wife;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
them	1
from	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Haran,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Terah	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
years:	1
and	1
Terah	1
died	1
in	1
Haran.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee:	1
12:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
name	1
great;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
blessing:	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
curse	1
him	1
that	1
curseth	1
thee:	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
12:4	1
So	1
Abram	1
departed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
Lot	1
went	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
Abram	1
was	1
seventy	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
Haran.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
Abram	1
took	1
Sarai	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Lot	1
his	1
brother's	1
son,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
substance	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gathered,	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
Haran;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
they	1
came.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
Abram	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Sichem,	1
unto	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Moreh.	1
And	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
and	1
said,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
land:	1
and	1
there	1
builded	1
he	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent,	1
having	1
Bethel	1
on	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
Hai	1
on	1
the	1
east:	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
Abram	1
journeyed,	1
going	1
on	1
still	1
toward	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
Abram	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
sojourn	1
there;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
grievous	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Sarai	1
his	1
wife,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
fair	1
woman	1
to	1
look	1
upon:	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
see	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
kill	1
me,	1
but	1
they	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
alive.	1
	1
12:13	1
Say,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
sister:	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
sake;	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
live	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Abram	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
beheld	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
fair.	1
	1
12:15	1
The	1
princes	1
also	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
commended	1
her	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
house.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
he	1
entreated	1
Abram	1
well	1
for	1
her	1
sake:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
he	1
asses,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
she	1
asses,	1
and	1
camels.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
plagued	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
great	1
plagues	1
because	1
of	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife.	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
Abram	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me?	1
why	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
12:19	1
Why	1
saidst	1
thou,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
so	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
wife:	1
now	1
therefore	1
behold	1
thy	1
wife,	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
commanded	1
his	1
men	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
Abram	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
Lot	1
with	1
him,	1
into	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Abram	1
was	1
very	1
rich	1
in	1
cattle,	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
gold.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
journeys	1
from	1
the	1
south	1
even	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
tent	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
between	1
Bethel	1
and	1
Hai;	1
13:4	1
Unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
make	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
there	1
Abram	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Lot	1
also,	1
which	1
went	1
with	1
Abram,	1
had	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
tents.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
dwell	1
together:	1
for	1
their	1
substance	1
was	1
great,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
dwell	1
together.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strife	1
between	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Abram's	1
cattle	1
and	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Lot's	1
cattle:	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite	1
dwelled	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
Abram	1
said	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
strife,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
between	1
my	1
herdmen	1
and	1
thy	1
herdmen;	1
for	1
we	1
be	1
brethren.	1
	1
13:9	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
before	1
thee?	1
separate	1
thyself,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
me:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
right;	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
depart	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
Lot	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
beheld	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
watered	1
every	1
where,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroyed	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
comest	1
unto	1
Zoar.	1
	1
13:11	1
Then	1
Lot	1
chose	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
Lot	1
journeyed	1
east:	1
and	1
they	1
separated	1
themselves	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
13:12	1
Abram	1
dwelled	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
Lot	1
dwelled	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
toward	1
Sodom.	1
	1
13:13	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Sodom	1
were	1
wicked	1
and	1
sinners	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
after	1
that	1
Lot	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
him,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
look	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
art	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward,	1
and	1
eastward,	1
and	1
westward:	1
13:15	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
seest,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
number	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
then	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
also	1
be	1
numbered.	1
	1
13:17	1
Arise,	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
13:18	1
Then	1
Abram	1
removed	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Mamre,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Amraphel	1
king	1
of	1
Shinar,	1
Arioch	1
king	1
of	1
Ellasar,	1
Chedorlaomer	1
king	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
Tidal	1
king	1
of	1
nations;	1
14:2	1
That	1
these	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
Bera	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
with	1
Birsha	1
king	1
of	1
Gomorrah,	1
Shinab	1
king	1
of	1
Admah,	1
and	1
Shemeber	1
king	1
of	1
Zeboiim,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bela,	1
which	1
is	1
Zoar.	1
	1
14:3	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
salt	1
sea.	1
	1
14:4	1
Twelve	1
years	1
they	1
served	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
thirteenth	1
year	1
they	1
rebelled.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
came	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Rephaims	1
in	1
Ashteroth	1
Karnaim,	1
and	1
the	1
Zuzims	1
in	1
Ham,	1
and	1
the	1
Emins	1
in	1
Shaveh	1
Kiriathaim,	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
Horites	1
in	1
their	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
unto	1
Elparan,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Enmishpat,	1
which	1
is	1
Kadesh,	1
and	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Hazezontamar.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Admah,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Zeboiim,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bela	1
(the	1
same	1
is	1
Zoar;)	1
and	1
they	1
joined	1
battle	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim;	1
14:9	1
With	1
Chedorlaomer	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Elam,	1
and	1
with	1
Tidal	1
king	1
of	1
nations,	1
and	1
Amraphel	1
king	1
of	1
Shinar,	1
and	1
Arioch	1
king	1
of	1
Ellasar;	1
four	1
kings	1
with	1
five.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Siddim	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
slimepits;	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
fled,	1
and	1
fell	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
remained	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
mountain.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
victuals,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Lot,	1
Abram's	1
brother's	1
son,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
his	1
goods,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
escaped,	1
and	1
told	1
Abram	1
the	1
Hebrew;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Mamre	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
brother	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
Aner:	1
and	1
these	1
were	1
confederate	1
with	1
Abram.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
when	1
Abram	1
heard	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
taken	1
captive,	1
he	1
armed	1
his	1
trained	1
servants,	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
pursued	1
them	1
unto	1
Dan.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
himself	1
against	1
them,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
pursued	1
them	1
unto	1
Hobah,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
of	1
Damascus.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
goods,	1
and	1
also	1
brought	1
again	1
his	1
brother	1
Lot,	1
and	1
his	1
goods,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
Chedorlaomer,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shaveh,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
dale.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
Melchizedek	1
king	1
of	1
Salem	1
brought	1
forth	1
bread	1
and	1
wine:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
Abram	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
possessor	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth:	1
14:20	1
And	1
blessed	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
delivered	1
thine	1
enemies	1
into	1
thy	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
tithes	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
persons,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
goods	1
to	1
thyself.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
Abram	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
I	1
have	1
lift	1
up	1
mine	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
14:23	1
That	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
from	1
a	1
thread	1
even	1
to	1
a	1
shoelatchet,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thine,	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
Abram	1
rich:	1
14:24	1
Save	1
only	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
eaten,	1
and	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
went	1
with	1
me,	1
Aner,	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
Mamre;	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
their	1
portion.	1
	1
15:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Abram	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Abram:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
shield,	1
and	1
thy	1
exceeding	1
great	1
reward.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Abram	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me,	1
seeing	1
I	1
go	1
childless,	1
and	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
this	1
Eliezer	1
of	1
Damascus?	1
15:3	1
And	1
Abram	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
no	1
seed:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
one	1
born	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
is	1
mine	1
heir.	1
	1
15:4	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
This	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thine	1
heir;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
bowels	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
heir.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
abroad,	1
and	1
said,	1
Look	1
now	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
stars,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
number	1
them:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
counted	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
inherit	1
it.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God,	1
whereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it?	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
me	1
an	1
heifer	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
she	1
goat	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
a	1
turtledove,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
pigeon.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
these,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
laid	1
each	1
piece	1
one	1
against	1
another:	1
but	1
the	1
birds	1
divided	1
he	1
not.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
fowls	1
came	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases,	1
Abram	1
drove	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
going	1
down,	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
fell	1
upon	1
Abram;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
an	1
horror	1
of	1
great	1
darkness	1
fell	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Know	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
that	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
their's,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
afflict	1
them	1
four	1
hundred	1
years;	1
15:14	1
And	1
also	1
that	1
nation,	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
serve,	1
will	1
I	1
judge:	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
great	1
substance.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
to	1
thy	1
fathers	1
in	1
peace;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age.	1
	1
15:16	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
hither	1
again:	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
full.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dark,	1
behold	1
a	1
smoking	1
furnace,	1
and	1
a	1
burning	1
lamp	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
those	1
pieces.	1
	1
15:18	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abram,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
this	1
land,	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates:	1
15:19	1
The	1
Kenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Kenizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Kadmonites,	1
15:20	1
And	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Rephaims,	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
bare	1
him	1
no	1
children:	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
handmaid,	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Hagar.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
Sarai	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
restrained	1
me	1
from	1
bearing:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
my	1
maid;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
obtain	1
children	1
by	1
her.	1
And	1
Abram	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Sarai.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
Sarai	1
Abram's	1
wife	1
took	1
Hagar	1
her	1
maid	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
after	1
Abram	1
had	1
dwelt	1
ten	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
Abram	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Hagar,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
conceived,	1
her	1
mistress	1
was	1
despised	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
Sarai	1
said	1
unto	1
Abram,	1
My	1
wrong	1
be	1
upon	1
thee:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
maid	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
conceived,	1
I	1
was	1
despised	1
in	1
her	1
eyes:	1
the	1
LORD	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
Abram	1
said	1
unto	1
Sarai,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
maid	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
do	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
pleaseth	1
thee.	1
And	1
when	1
Sarai	1
dealt	1
hardly	1
with	1
her,	1
she	1
fled	1
from	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
found	1
her	1
by	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
by	1
the	1
fountain	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Shur.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hagar,	1
Sarai's	1
maid,	1
whence	1
camest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
mistress	1
Sarai.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Return	1
to	1
thy	1
mistress,	1
and	1
submit	1
thyself	1
under	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
exceedingly,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
with	1
child	1
and	1
shalt	1
bear	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Ishmael;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
thy	1
affliction.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
wild	1
man;	1
his	1
hand	1
will	1
be	1
against	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
every	1
man's	1
hand	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
spake	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
God	1
seest	1
me:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Have	1
I	1
also	1
here	1
looked	1
after	1
him	1
that	1
seeth	1
me?	1
	1
16:14	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
well	1
was	1
called	1
Beerlahairoi;	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
between	1
Kadesh	1
and	1
Bered.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Hagar	1
bare	1
Abram	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
Abram	1
called	1
his	1
son's	1
name,	1
which	1
Hagar	1
bare,	1
Ishmael.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Abram	1
was	1
fourscore	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
Hagar	1
bare	1
Ishmael	1
to	1
Abram.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
when	1
Abram	1
was	1
ninety	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
nine,	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
to	1
Abram,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Almighty	1
God;	1
walk	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
perfect.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
Abram	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
God	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
saying,	1
17:4	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
behold,	1
my	1
covenant	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations.	1
	1
17:5	1
Neither	1
shall	1
thy	1
name	1
any	1
more	1
be	1
called	1
Abram,	1
but	1
thy	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
Abraham;	1
for	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
thee.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
exceeding	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
nations	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
kings	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
generations	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
God	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee,	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
possession;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
my	1
covenant	1
therefore,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
17:10	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
covenant,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep,	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee;	1
Every	1
man	1
child	1
among	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
circumcise	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
foreskin;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
you.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
eight	1
days	1
old	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised	1
among	1
you,	1
every	1
man	1
child	1
in	1
your	1
generations,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
or	1
bought	1
with	1
money	1
of	1
any	1
stranger,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
17:13	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
bought	1
with	1
thy	1
money,	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
and	1
my	1
covenant	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
flesh	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
man	1
child	1
whose	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin	1
is	1
not	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people;	1
he	1
hath	1
broken	1
my	1
covenant.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
As	1
for	1
Sarai	1
thy	1
wife,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
call	1
her	1
name	1
Sarai,	1
but	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
her	1
name	1
be.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
her,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
son	1
also	1
of	1
her:	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
mother	1
of	1
nations;	1
kings	1
of	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
17:17	1
Then	1
Abraham	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Shall	1
a	1
child	1
be	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old?	1
and	1
shall	1
Sarah,	1
that	1
is	1
ninety	1
years	1
old,	1
bear?	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
O	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
might	1
live	1
before	1
thee!	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
God	1
said,	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
a	1
son	1
indeed;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
Ishmael,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee:	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
will	1
multiply	1
him	1
exceedingly;	1
twelve	1
princes	1
shall	1
he	1
beget,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
17:21	1
But	1
my	1
covenant	1
will	1
I	1
establish	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
which	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
bear	1
unto	1
thee	1
at	1
this	1
set	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
year.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
talking	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
God	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Abraham.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
bought	1
with	1
his	1
money,	1
every	1
male	1
among	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Abraham's	1
house;	1
and	1
circumcised	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
their	1
foreskin	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
ninety	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
nine,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
circumcised	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
thirteen	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
circumcised	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin.	1
	1
17:26	1
In	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
was	1
Abraham	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
bought	1
with	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
were	1
circumcised	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Mamre:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
three	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
tent	1
door,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
18:3	1
And	1
said,	1
My	1
LORD,	1
if	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
pass	1
not	1
away,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
thy	1
servant:	1
18:4	1
Let	1
a	1
little	1
water,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
be	1
fetched,	1
and	1
wash	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
rest	1
yourselves	1
under	1
the	1
tree:	1
18:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
comfort	1
ye	1
your	1
hearts;	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
pass	1
on:	1
for	1
therefore	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
to	1
your	1
servant.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
So	1
do,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
hastened	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
unto	1
Sarah,	1
and	1
said,	1
Make	1
ready	1
quickly	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
fine	1
meal,	1
knead	1
it,	1
and	1
make	1
cakes	1
upon	1
the	1
hearth.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
Abraham	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
herd,	1
and	1
fetcht	1
a	1
calf	1
tender	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
a	1
young	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
hasted	1
to	1
dress	1
it.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
butter,	1
and	1
milk,	1
and	1
the	1
calf	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
dressed,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
certainly	1
return	1
unto	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
Sarah	1
thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
And	1
Sarah	1
heard	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
door,	1
which	1
was	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Sarah	1
were	1
old	1
and	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
age;	1
and	1
it	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Sarah	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
women.	1
	1
18:12	1
Therefore	1
Sarah	1
laughed	1
within	1
herself,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
am	1
waxed	1
old	1
shall	1
I	1
have	1
pleasure,	1
my	1
lord	1
being	1
old	1
also?	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Wherefore	1
did	1
Sarah	1
laugh,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
bear	1
a	1
child,	1
which	1
am	1
old?	1
	1
18:14	1
Is	1
any	1
thing	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
the	1
LORD?	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
thee,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
18:15	1
Then	1
Sarah	1
denied,	1
saying,	1
I	1
laughed	1
not;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
afraid.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
thou	1
didst	1
laugh.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
looked	1
toward	1
Sodom:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
went	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Shall	1
I	1
hide	1
from	1
Abraham	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
do;	1
18:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
Abraham	1
shall	1
surely	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
nation,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
him?	1
18:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
command	1
his	1
children	1
and	1
his	1
household	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
and	1
judgment;	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
may	1
bring	1
upon	1
Abraham	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
sin	1
is	1
very	1
grievous;	1
18:21	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
altogether	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
know.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
turned	1
their	1
faces	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
Sodom:	1
but	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
yet	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
Abraham	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
also	1
destroy	1
the	1
righteous	1
with	1
the	1
wicked?	1
	1
18:24	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
be	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
within	1
the	1
city:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
also	1
destroy	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
that	1
are	1
therein?	1
	1
18:25	1
That	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
righteous	1
with	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
righteous	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wicked,	1
that	1
be	1
far	1
from	1
thee:	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
right?	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
Sodom	1
fifty	1
righteous	1
within	1
the	1
city,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
all	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
their	1
sakes.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
am	1
but	1
dust	1
and	1
ashes:	1
18:28	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
lack	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
fifty	1
righteous:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
five?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
find	1
there	1
forty	1
and	1
five,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
forty	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
forty's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
angry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak:	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
thirty	1
be	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it,	1
if	1
I	1
find	1
thirty	1
there.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Peradventure	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
twenty	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it	1
for	1
twenty's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Oh	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
angry,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
yet	1
but	1
this	1
once:	1
Peradventure	1
ten	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
it	1
for	1
ten's	1
sake.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
communing	1
with	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
two	1
angels	1
to	1
Sodom	1
at	1
even;	1
and	1
Lot	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Sodom:	1
and	1
Lot	1
seeing	1
them	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground;	1
19:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
my	1
lords,	1
turn	1
in,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
into	1
your	1
servant's	1
house,	1
and	1
tarry	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
wash	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
your	1
ways.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
pressed	1
upon	1
them	1
greatly;	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
19:4	1
But	1
before	1
they	1
lay	1
down,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Sodom,	1
compassed	1
the	1
house	1
round,	1
both	1
old	1
and	1
young,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
every	1
quarter:	1
19:5	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
thee	1
this	1
night?	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him,	1
19:7	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
wickedly.	1
	1
19:8	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
daughters	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
man;	1
let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
eyes:	1
only	1
unto	1
these	1
men	1
do	1
nothing;	1
for	1
therefore	1
came	1
they	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
my	1
roof.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Stand	1
back.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
again,	1
This	1
one	1
fellow	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
sojourn,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
judge:	1
now	1
will	1
we	1
deal	1
worse	1
with	1
thee,	1
than	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
pressed	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
Lot,	1
and	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:10	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
pulled	1
Lot	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
blindness,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great:	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
wearied	1
themselves	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
Lot,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
here	1
any	1
besides?	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place:	1
19:13	1
For	1
we	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
because	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
waxen	1
great	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
us	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
in	1
law,	1
which	1
married	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
said,	1
Up,	1
get	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
place;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
city.	1
But	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
mocked	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
arose,	1
then	1
the	1
angels	1
hastened	1
Lot,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
take	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thy	1
two	1
daughters,	1
which	1
are	1
here;	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
lingered,	1
the	1
men	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
daughters;	1
the	1
LORD	1
being	1
merciful	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
abroad,	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Escape	1
for	1
thy	1
life;	1
look	1
not	1
behind	1
thee,	1
neither	1
stay	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
plain;	1
escape	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
lest	1
thou	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
Lot	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Oh,	1
not	1
so,	1
my	1
LORD:	1
19:19	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
magnified	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
saving	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
escape	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
lest	1
some	1
evil	1
take	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
die:	1
19:20	1
Behold	1
now,	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
near	1
to	1
flee	1
unto,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
one:	1
Oh,	1
let	1
me	1
escape	1
thither,	1
(is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
one?)	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
accepted	1
thee	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing	1
also,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
overthrow	1
this	1
city,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
	1
19:22	1
Haste	1
thee,	1
escape	1
thither;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
anything	1
till	1
thou	1
be	1
come	1
thither.	1
Therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
called	1
Zoar.	1
	1
19:23	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
risen	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
when	1
Lot	1
entered	1
into	1
Zoar.	1
	1
19:24	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
rained	1
upon	1
Sodom	1
and	1
upon	1
Gomorrah	1
brimstone	1
and	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
heaven;	1
19:25	1
And	1
he	1
overthrew	1
those	1
cities,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
grew	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
19:26	1
But	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
back	1
from	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
salt.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
gat	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
19:28	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
toward	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
went	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
furnace.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
God	1
destroyed	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
that	1
God	1
remembered	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
sent	1
Lot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
overthrow,	1
when	1
he	1
overthrew	1
the	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Lot	1
dwelt.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
Lot	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Zoar,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
daughters	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
Zoar:	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
cave,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
daughters.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
the	1
firstborn	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
younger,	1
Our	1
father	1
is	1
old,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
us	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
19:32	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
our	1
father	1
drink	1
wine,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
lie	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
seed	1
of	1
our	1
father.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
father	1
drink	1
wine	1
that	1
night:	1
and	1
the	1
firstborn	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
father;	1
and	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
when	1
she	1
lay	1
down,	1
nor	1
when	1
she	1
arose.	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
firstborn	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
younger,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
yesternight	1
with	1
my	1
father:	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
him	1
drink	1
wine	1
this	1
night	1
also;	1
and	1
go	1
thou	1
in,	1
and	1
lie	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
preserve	1
seed	1
of	1
our	1
father.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
father	1
drink	1
wine	1
that	1
night	1
also:	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
arose,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
when	1
she	1
lay	1
down,	1
nor	1
when	1
she	1
arose.	1
	1
19:36	1
Thus	1
were	1
both	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Lot	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
their	1
father.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
born	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Moab:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
the	1
younger,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Benammi:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
Abraham	1
journeyed	1
from	1
thence	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
country,	1
and	1
dwelled	1
between	1
Kadesh	1
and	1
Shur,	1
and	1
sojourned	1
in	1
Gerar.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
of	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister:	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
Gerar	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
Sarah.	1
	1
20:3	1
But	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Abimelech	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
a	1
dead	1
man,	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken;	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
man's	1
wife.	1
	1
20:4	1
But	1
Abimelech	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
near	1
her:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
slay	1
also	1
a	1
righteous	1
nation?	1
	1
20:5	1
Said	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
me,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
and	1
she,	1
even	1
she	1
herself	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
brother:	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
innocency	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
this.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
thy	1
heart;	1
for	1
I	1
also	1
withheld	1
thee	1
from	1
sinning	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
suffered	1
I	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
her.	1
	1
20:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
restore	1
the	1
man	1
his	1
wife;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
restore	1
her	1
not,	1
know	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
20:8	1
Therefore	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
called	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
their	1
ears:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
Abimelech	1
called	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
kingdom	1
a	1
great	1
sin?	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
deeds	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
What	1
sawest	1
thou,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
thing?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
thought,	1
Surely	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
slay	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
wife's	1
sake.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
yet	1
indeed	1
she	1
is	1
my	1
sister;	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
mother;	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
my	1
wife.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
God	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
wander	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
This	1
is	1
thy	1
kindness	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
unto	1
me;	1
at	1
every	1
place	1
whither	1
we	1
shall	1
come,	1
say	1
of	1
me,	1
He	1
is	1
my	1
brother.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
took	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
womenservants,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
restored	1
him	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
land	1
is	1
before	1
thee:	1
dwell	1
where	1
it	1
pleaseth	1
thee.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thy	1
brother	1
a	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
other:	1
thus	1
she	1
was	1
reproved.	1
	1
20:17	1
So	1
Abraham	1
prayed	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
God	1
healed	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
maidservants;	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
children.	1
	1
20:18	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
fast	1
closed	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
wombs	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abimelech,	1
because	1
of	1
Sarah	1
Abraham's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
visited	1
Sarah	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
unto	1
Sarah	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
spoken.	1
	1
21:2	1
For	1
Sarah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Abraham	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
at	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
of	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
him,	1
whom	1
Sarah	1
bare	1
to	1
him,	1
Isaac.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
Abraham	1
circumcised	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac	1
being	1
eight	1
days	1
old,	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
Sarah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
laugh,	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
will	1
laugh	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
that	1
Sarah	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
children	1
suck?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
weaned:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Isaac	1
was	1
weaned.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
Sarah	1
saw	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hagar	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
born	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
mocking.	1
	1
21:10	1
Wherefore	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Cast	1
out	1
this	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
this	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
my	1
son,	1
even	1
with	1
Isaac.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
very	1
grievous	1
in	1
Abraham's	1
sight	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
grievous	1
in	1
thy	1
sight	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
bondwoman;	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
Sarah	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her	1
voice;	1
for	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
nation,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
Abraham	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
Hagar,	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
away:	1
and	1
she	1
departed,	1
and	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
bottle,	1
and	1
she	1
cast	1
the	1
child	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
shrubs.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
sat	1
her	1
down	1
over	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
bow	1
shot:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
God	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
lad;	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
called	1
to	1
Hagar	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee,	1
Hagar?	1
fear	1
not;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
where	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
21:18	1
Arise,	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
hold	1
him	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
God	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
bottle	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
lad	1
drink.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
lad;	1
and	1
he	1
grew,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
became	1
an	1
archer.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
took	1
him	1
a	1
wife	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
spake	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest:	1
21:23	1
Now	1
therefore	1
swear	1
unto	1
me	1
here	1
by	1
God	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
deal	1
falsely	1
with	1
me,	1
nor	1
with	1
my	1
son,	1
nor	1
with	1
my	1
son's	1
son:	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
kindness	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
sojourned.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
swear.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
Abraham	1
reproved	1
Abimelech	1
because	1
of	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water,	1
which	1
Abimelech's	1
servants	1
had	1
violently	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
I	1
wot	1
not	1
who	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing;	1
neither	1
didst	1
thou	1
tell	1
me,	1
neither	1
yet	1
heard	1
I	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
Abimelech;	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
made	1
a	1
covenant.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
Abraham	1
set	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
by	1
themselves.	1
	1
21:29	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
What	1
mean	1
these	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
by	1
themselves?	1
	1
21:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
these	1
seven	1
ewe	1
lambs	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
of	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
this	1
well.	1
	1
21:31	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Beersheba;	1
because	1
there	1
they	1
sware	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:32	1
Thus	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
at	1
Beersheba:	1
then	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host,	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
21:33	1
And	1
Abraham	1
planted	1
a	1
grove	1
in	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
called	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
Abraham	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
land	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
God	1
did	1
tempt	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
here	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
now	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son	1
Isaac,	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moriah;	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
of.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
clave	1
the	1
wood	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
told	1
him.	1
	1
22:4	1
Then	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
Abraham	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
place	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
Abide	1
ye	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
ass;	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
will	1
go	1
yonder	1
and	1
worship,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
took	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
knife;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
Isaac	1
spake	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I,	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
wood:	1
but	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
lamb	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
My	1
son,	1
God	1
will	1
provide	1
himself	1
a	1
lamb	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
of;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
there,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
bound	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
upon	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
knife	1
to	1
slay	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Abraham,	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lay	1
not	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
lad,	1
neither	1
do	1
thou	1
any	1
thing	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
fearest	1
God,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
withheld	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Abraham	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
ram	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
thicket	1
by	1
his	1
horns:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
in	1
the	1
stead	1
of	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
Abraham	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Jehovahjireh:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
In	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
22:16	1
And	1
said,	1
By	1
myself	1
have	1
I	1
sworn,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
withheld	1
thy	1
son,	1
thine	1
only	1
son:	1
22:17	1
That	1
in	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
shore;	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
enemies;	1
22:18	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
22:19	1
So	1
Abraham	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
together	1
to	1
Beersheba;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Milcah,	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
born	1
children	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother	1
Nahor;	1
22:21	1
Huz	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
Buz	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
Kemuel	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Aram,	1
22:22	1
And	1
Chesed,	1
and	1
Hazo,	1
and	1
Pildash,	1
and	1
Jidlaph,	1
and	1
Bethuel.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
Bethuel	1
begat	1
Rebekah:	1
these	1
eight	1
Milcah	1
did	1
bear	1
to	1
Nahor,	1
Abraham's	1
brother.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
his	1
concubine,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Reumah,	1
she	1
bare	1
also	1
Tebah,	1
and	1
Gaham,	1
and	1
Thahash,	1
and	1
Maachah.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Sarah	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Sarah.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
Sarah	1
died	1
in	1
Kirjatharba;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Hebron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
and	1
Abraham	1
came	1
to	1
mourn	1
for	1
Sarah,	1
and	1
to	1
weep	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
up	1
from	1
before	1
his	1
dead,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth,	1
saying,	1
23:4	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger	1
and	1
a	1
sojourner	1
with	1
you:	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth	1
answered	1
Abraham,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
23:6	1
Hear	1
us,	1
my	1
lord:	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
mighty	1
prince	1
among	1
us:	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
our	1
sepulchres	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead;	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
withhold	1
from	1
thee	1
his	1
sepulchre,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
Abraham	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
he	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
saying,	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
mind	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight;	1
hear	1
me,	1
and	1
intreat	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
Ephron	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zohar,	1
23:9	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
he	1
hath,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
field;	1
for	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
amongst	1
you.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
Ephron	1
dwelt	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth:	1
and	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite	1
answered	1
Abraham	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city,	1
saying,	1
23:11	1
Nay,	1
my	1
lord,	1
hear	1
me:	1
the	1
field	1
give	1
I	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
thee;	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
give	1
I	1
it	1
thee:	1
bury	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
Abraham	1
bowed	1
down	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ephron	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
give	1
it,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hear	1
me:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
field;	1
take	1
it	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bury	1
my	1
dead	1
there.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
Ephron	1
answered	1
Abraham,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
23:15	1
My	1
lord,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
worth	1
four	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver;	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee?	1
bury	1
therefore	1
thy	1
dead.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
Abraham	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
Ephron;	1
and	1
Abraham	1
weighed	1
to	1
Ephron	1
the	1
silver,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
named	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth,	1
four	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
current	1
money	1
with	1
the	1
merchant.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
Mamre,	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
which	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
borders	1
round	1
about,	1
were	1
made	1
sure	1
23:18	1
Unto	1
Abraham	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth,	1
before	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
23:19	1
And	1
after	1
this,	1
Abraham	1
buried	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah	1
before	1
Mamre:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Hebron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
23:20	1
And	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
were	1
made	1
sure	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
by	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Abraham	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
age:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
blessed	1
Abraham	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
eldest	1
servant	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
ruled	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
Put,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
hand	1
under	1
my	1
thigh:	1
24:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
dwell:	1
24:4	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
country,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
Isaac.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Peradventure	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
follow	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
land:	1
must	1
I	1
needs	1
bring	1
thy	1
son	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
camest?	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
Abraham	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Beware	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
bring	1
not	1
my	1
son	1
thither	1
again.	1
	1
24:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
took	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
sware	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
land;	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
his	1
angel	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
follow	1
thee,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
this	1
my	1
oath:	1
only	1
bring	1
not	1
my	1
son	1
thither	1
again.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
under	1
the	1
thigh	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
sware	1
to	1
him	1
concerning	1
that	1
matter.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
took	1
ten	1
camels	1
of	1
the	1
camels	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
departed;	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goods	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Mesopotamia,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nahor.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
camels	1
to	1
kneel	1
down	1
without	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
evening,	1
even	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
women	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
send	1
me	1
good	1
speed	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham.	1
	1
24:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
here	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water:	1
24:14	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
damsel	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
say,	1
Let	1
down	1
thy	1
pitcher,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drink;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
say,	1
Drink,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
camels	1
drink	1
also:	1
let	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
she	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
appointed	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
thereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
unto	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
speaking,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
Rebekah	1
came	1
out,	1
who	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
Bethuel,	1
son	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nahor,	1
Abraham's	1
brother,	1
with	1
her	1
pitcher	1
upon	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
very	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
upon,	1
a	1
virgin,	1
neither	1
had	1
any	1
man	1
known	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
filled	1
her	1
pitcher,	1
and	1
came	1
up.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
drink	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
of	1
thy	1
pitcher.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Drink,	1
my	1
lord:	1
and	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
her	1
pitcher	1
upon	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
drink.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
giving	1
him	1
drink,	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
water	1
for	1
thy	1
camels	1
also,	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
drinking.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
emptied	1
her	1
pitcher	1
into	1
the	1
trough,	1
and	1
ran	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
well	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
drew	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
camels.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
wondering	1
at	1
her	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
to	1
wit	1
whether	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
journey	1
prosperous	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
camels	1
had	1
done	1
drinking,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
a	1
golden	1
earring	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
shekel	1
weight,	1
and	1
two	1
bracelets	1
for	1
her	1
hands	1
of	1
ten	1
shekels	1
weight	1
of	1
gold;	1
24:23	1
And	1
said,	1
Whose	1
daughter	1
art	1
thou?	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee:	1
is	1
there	1
room	1
in	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
lodge	1
in?	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Milcah,	1
which	1
she	1
bare	1
unto	1
Nahor.	1
	1
24:25	1
She	1
said	1
moreover	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
both	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
enough,	1
and	1
room	1
to	1
lodge	1
in.	1
	1
24:26	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
bowed	1
down	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
destitute	1
my	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
his	1
truth:	1
I	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
LORD	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
master's	1
brethren.	1
	1
24:28	1
And	1
the	1
damsel	1
ran,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
house	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
24:29	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
had	1
a	1
brother,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Laban:	1
and	1
Laban	1
ran	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
well.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
earring	1
and	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
his	1
sister's	1
hands,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
sister,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
spake	1
the	1
man	1
unto	1
me;	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
man;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
camels	1
at	1
the	1
well.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come	1
in,	1
thou	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
wherefore	1
standest	1
thou	1
without?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
camels.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
he	1
ungirded	1
his	1
camels,	1
and	1
gave	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
for	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
water	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
the	1
men's	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
eat:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
mine	1
errand.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Speak	1
on.	1
	1
24:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Abraham's	1
servant.	1
	1
24:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
my	1
master	1
greatly;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
become	1
great:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
camels,	1
and	1
asses.	1
	1
24:36	1
And	1
Sarah	1
my	1
master's	1
wife	1
bare	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
old:	1
and	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
24:37	1
And	1
my	1
master	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
in	1
whose	1
land	1
I	1
dwell:	1
24:38	1
But	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
unto	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
24:39	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
master,	1
Peradventure	1
the	1
woman	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
24:40	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
walk,	1
will	1
send	1
his	1
angel	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
prosper	1
thy	1
way;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
kindred,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
24:41	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
this	1
my	1
oath,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
my	1
kindred;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
give	1
not	1
thee	1
one,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clear	1
from	1
my	1
oath.	1
	1
24:42	1
And	1
I	1
came	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
if	1
now	1
thou	1
do	1
prosper	1
my	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
go:	1
24:43	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
water;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
virgin	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
her,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
of	1
thy	1
pitcher	1
to	1
drink;	1
24:44	1
And	1
she	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
Both	1
drink	1
thou,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
draw	1
for	1
thy	1
camels:	1
let	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
appointed	1
out	1
for	1
my	1
master's	1
son.	1
	1
24:45	1
And	1
before	1
I	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
behold,	1
Rebekah	1
came	1
forth	1
with	1
her	1
pitcher	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
drew	1
water:	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Let	1
me	1
drink,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
	1
24:46	1
And	1
she	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
her	1
pitcher	1
from	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
said,	1
Drink,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
camels	1
drink	1
also:	1
so	1
I	1
drank,	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
camels	1
drink	1
also.	1
	1
24:47	1
And	1
I	1
asked	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Whose	1
daughter	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel,	1
Nahor's	1
son,	1
whom	1
Milcah	1
bare	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
earring	1
upon	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelets	1
upon	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
24:48	1
And	1
I	1
bowed	1
down	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
master's	1
brother's	1
daughter	1
unto	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
24:49	1
And	1
now	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
deal	1
kindly	1
and	1
truly	1
with	1
my	1
master,	1
tell	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
tell	1
me;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
24:50	1
Then	1
Laban	1
and	1
Bethuel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
LORD:	1
we	1
cannot	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
bad	1
or	1
good.	1
	1
24:51	1
Behold,	1
Rebekah	1
is	1
before	1
thee,	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
go,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
thy	1
master's	1
son's	1
wife,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken.	1
	1
24:52	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Abraham's	1
servant	1
heard	1
their	1
words,	1
he	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD,	1
bowing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
24:53	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
brought	1
forth	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
Rebekah:	1
he	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
precious	1
things.	1
	1
24:54	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
tarried	1
all	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Send	1
me	1
away	1
unto	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:55	1
And	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
damsel	1
abide	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
ten;	1
after	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
go.	1
	1
24:56	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hinder	1
me	1
not,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prospered	1
my	1
way;	1
send	1
me	1
away	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
master.	1
	1
24:57	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
call	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
enquire	1
at	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
24:58	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
this	1
man?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go.	1
	1
24:59	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
away	1
Rebekah	1
their	1
sister,	1
and	1
her	1
nurse,	1
and	1
Abraham's	1
servant,	1
and	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
24:60	1
And	1
they	1
blessed	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
our	1
sister,	1
be	1
thou	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
millions,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
seed	1
possess	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
hate	1
them.	1
	1
24:61	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
arose,	1
and	1
her	1
damsels,	1
and	1
they	1
rode	1
upon	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
man:	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
took	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
24:62	1
And	1
Isaac	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
Lahairoi;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
south	1
country.	1
	1
24:63	1
And	1
Isaac	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meditate	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
the	1
eventide:	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
camels	1
were	1
coming.	1
	1
24:64	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Isaac,	1
she	1
lighted	1
off	1
the	1
camel.	1
	1
24:65	1
For	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
meet	1
us?	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
had	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
master:	1
therefore	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
vail,	1
and	1
covered	1
herself.	1
	1
24:66	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
told	1
Isaac	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
24:67	1
And	1
Isaac	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
his	1
mother	1
Sarah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
took	1
Rebekah,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
her:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
was	1
comforted	1
after	1
his	1
mother's	1
death.	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
again	1
Abraham	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Keturah.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
she	1
bare	1
him	1
Zimran,	1
and	1
Jokshan,	1
and	1
Medan,	1
and	1
Midian,	1
and	1
Ishbak,	1
and	1
Shuah.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
Jokshan	1
begat	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Dedan.	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Dedan	1
were	1
Asshurim,	1
and	1
Letushim,	1
and	1
Leummim.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Midian;	1
Ephah,	1
and	1
Epher,	1
and	1
Hanoch,	1
and	1
Abidah,	1
and	1
Eldaah.	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Keturah.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
unto	1
Isaac.	1
	1
25:6	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
concubines,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
had,	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
gifts,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away	1
from	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
lived,	1
eastward,	1
unto	1
the	1
east	1
country.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
Abraham's	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
lived,	1
an	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
25:8	1
Then	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age,	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
years;	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
to	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zohar	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Mamre;	1
25:10	1
The	1
field	1
which	1
Abraham	1
purchased	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heth:	1
there	1
was	1
Abraham	1
buried,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
that	1
God	1
blessed	1
his	1
son	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
dwelt	1
by	1
the	1
well	1
Lahairoi.	1
	1
25:12	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
Abraham's	1
son,	1
whom	1
Hagar	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
Sarah's	1
handmaid,	1
bare	1
unto	1
Abraham:	1
25:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
by	1
their	1
names,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
generations:	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
Nebajoth;	1
and	1
Kedar,	1
and	1
Adbeel,	1
and	1
Mibsam,	1
25:14	1
And	1
Mishma,	1
and	1
Dumah,	1
and	1
Massa,	1
25:15	1
Hadar,	1
and	1
Tema,	1
Jetur,	1
Naphish,	1
and	1
Kedemah:	1
25:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
names,	1
by	1
their	1
towns,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
castles;	1
twelve	1
princes	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
nations.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
seven	1
years:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
and	1
died;	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
25:18	1
And	1
they	1
dwelt	1
from	1
Havilah	1
unto	1
Shur,	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Egypt,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
toward	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
Abraham's	1
son:	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac:	1
25:20	1
And	1
Isaac	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
Rebekah	1
to	1
wife,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
Syrian	1
of	1
Padanaram,	1
the	1
sister	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian.	1
	1
25:21	1
And	1
Isaac	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
barren:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife	1
conceived.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
struggled	1
together	1
within	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
thus?	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Two	1
nations	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
two	1
manner	1
of	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
separated	1
from	1
thy	1
bowels;	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
people;	1
and	1
the	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
days	1
to	1
be	1
delivered	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
behold,	1
there	1
were	1
twins	1
in	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
25:25	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
out	1
red,	1
all	1
over	1
like	1
an	1
hairy	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Esau.	1
	1
25:26	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
came	1
his	1
brother	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
took	1
hold	1
on	1
Esau's	1
heel;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
was	1
threescore	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
she	1
bare	1
them.	1
	1
25:27	1
And	1
the	1
boys	1
grew:	1
and	1
Esau	1
was	1
a	1
cunning	1
hunter,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
was	1
a	1
plain	1
man,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tents.	1
	1
25:28	1
And	1
Isaac	1
loved	1
Esau,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
venison:	1
but	1
Rebekah	1
loved	1
Jacob.	1
	1
25:29	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sod	1
pottage:	1
and	1
Esau	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
faint:	1
25:30	1
And	1
Esau	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
Feed	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
that	1
same	1
red	1
pottage;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
faint:	1
therefore	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
called	1
Edom.	1
	1
25:31	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Sell	1
me	1
this	1
day	1
thy	1
birthright.	1
	1
25:32	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
to	1
die:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
shall	1
this	1
birthright	1
do	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Swear	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
day;	1
and	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright	1
unto	1
Jacob.	1
	1
25:34	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
Esau	1
bread	1
and	1
pottage	1
of	1
lentiles;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way:	1
thus	1
Esau	1
despised	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
beside	1
the	1
first	1
famine	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
And	1
Isaac	1
went	1
unto	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
unto	1
Gerar.	1
	1
26:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
not	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
of:	1
26:3	1
Sojourn	1
in	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
bless	1
thee;	1
for	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
all	1
these	1
countries,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
the	1
oath	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father;	1
26:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
to	1
multiply	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
all	1
these	1
countries;	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed;	1
26:5	1
Because	1
that	1
Abraham	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
kept	1
my	1
charge,	1
my	1
commandments,	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
my	1
laws.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
Isaac	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gerar:	1
26:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
asked	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister:	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
to	1
say,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
wife;	1
lest,	1
said	1
he,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
should	1
kill	1
me	1
for	1
Rebekah;	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
upon.	1
	1
26:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Isaac	1
was	1
sporting	1
with	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
26:9	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
called	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
of	1
a	1
surety	1
she	1
is	1
thy	1
wife;	1
and	1
how	1
saidst	1
thou,	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
sister?	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
I	1
said,	1
Lest	1
I	1
die	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
26:10	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
might	1
lightly	1
have	1
lien	1
with	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
have	1
brought	1
guiltiness	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
charged	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
He	1
that	1
toucheth	1
this	1
man	1
or	1
his	1
wife	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
26:12	1
Then	1
Isaac	1
sowed	1
in	1
that	1
land,	1
and	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
an	1
hundredfold:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
26:13	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
waxed	1
great,	1
and	1
went	1
forward,	1
and	1
grew	1
until	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
great:	1
26:14	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
possession	1
of	1
flocks,	1
and	1
possession	1
of	1
herds,	1
and	1
great	1
store	1
of	1
servants:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
envied	1
him.	1
	1
26:15	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
wells	1
which	1
his	1
father's	1
servants	1
had	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
stopped	1
them,	1
and	1
filled	1
them	1
with	1
earth.	1
	1
26:16	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
said	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
Go	1
from	1
us;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
much	1
mightier	1
than	1
we.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
Isaac	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Gerar,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
Isaac	1
digged	1
again	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abraham	1
his	1
father;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
stopped	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
their	1
names	1
after	1
the	1
names	1
by	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
found	1
there	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
springing	1
water.	1
	1
26:20	1
And	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Gerar	1
did	1
strive	1
with	1
Isaac's	1
herdmen,	1
saying,	1
The	1
water	1
is	1
ours:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
Esek;	1
because	1
they	1
strove	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
they	1
digged	1
another	1
well,	1
and	1
strove	1
for	1
that	1
also:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Sitnah.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
digged	1
another	1
well;	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
strove	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Rehoboth;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
fruitful	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father:	1
fear	1
not,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
Abraham's	1
sake.	1
	1
26:25	1
And	1
he	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
there,	1
and	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
there:	1
and	1
there	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
digged	1
a	1
well.	1
	1
26:26	1
Then	1
Abimelech	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
Gerar,	1
and	1
Ahuzzath	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
Phichol	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
ye	1
to	1
me,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
26:28	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
saw	1
certainly	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
we	1
said,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
now	1
an	1
oath	1
betwixt	1
us,	1
even	1
betwixt	1
us	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee;	1
26:29	1
That	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
us	1
no	1
hurt,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
touched	1
thee,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
thee	1
nothing	1
but	1
good,	1
and	1
have	1
sent	1
thee	1
away	1
in	1
peace:	1
thou	1
art	1
now	1
the	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
26:31	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
betimes	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
sware	1
one	1
to	1
another:	1
and	1
Isaac	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
26:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
that	1
Isaac's	1
servants	1
came,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
well	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
digged,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
water.	1
	1
26:33	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
Shebah:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
Beersheba	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
26:34	1
And	1
Esau	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
Judith	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Beeri	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
Bashemath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Elon	1
the	1
Hittite:	1
26:35	1
Which	1
were	1
a	1
grief	1
of	1
mind	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
and	1
to	1
Rebekah.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Isaac	1
was	1
old,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see,	1
he	1
called	1
Esau	1
his	1
eldest	1
son,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
son:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
am	1
old,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
death:	1
27:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
take,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
weapons,	1
thy	1
quiver	1
and	1
thy	1
bow,	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
some	1
venison;	1
27:4	1
And	1
make	1
me	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat;	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
heard	1
when	1
Isaac	1
spake	1
to	1
Esau	1
his	1
son.	1
And	1
Esau	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
hunt	1
for	1
venison,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
it.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
spake	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
her	1
son,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
heard	1
thy	1
father	1
speak	1
unto	1
Esau	1
thy	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
27:7	1
Bring	1
me	1
venison,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat,	1
and	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
my	1
death.	1
	1
27:8	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
obey	1
my	1
voice	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee.	1
	1
27:9	1
Go	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
fetch	1
me	1
from	1
thence	1
two	1
good	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
savoury	1
meat	1
for	1
thy	1
father,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
loveth:	1
27:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bless	1
thee	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
to	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
mother,	1
Behold,	1
Esau	1
my	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
hairy	1
man,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
smooth	1
man:	1
27:12	1
My	1
father	1
peradventure	1
will	1
feel	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
deceiver;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Upon	1
me	1
be	1
thy	1
curse,	1
my	1
son:	1
only	1
obey	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
go	1
fetch	1
me	1
them.	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
fetched,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
mother:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
made	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
loved.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
took	1
goodly	1
raiment	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
son	1
Esau,	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Jacob	1
her	1
younger	1
son:	1
27:16	1
And	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
the	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
upon	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
smooth	1
of	1
his	1
neck:	1
27:17	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
savoury	1
meat	1
and	1
the	1
bread,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
prepared,	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
Jacob.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
who	1
art	1
thou,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
27:19	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
Esau	1
thy	1
first	1
born;	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
badest	1
me:	1
arise,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
sit	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
venison,	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
son,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
quickly,	1
my	1
son?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
27:21	1
And	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Come	1
near,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
feel	1
thee,	1
my	1
son,	1
whether	1
thou	1
be	1
my	1
very	1
son	1
Esau	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
near	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father;	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
voice	1
is	1
Jacob's	1
voice,	1
but	1
the	1
hands	1
are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Esau.	1
	1
27:23	1
And	1
he	1
discerned	1
him	1
not,	1
because	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
hairy,	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
Esau's	1
hands:	1
so	1
he	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
27:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
my	1
very	1
son	1
Esau?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
27:25	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
it	1
near	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
of	1
my	1
son's	1
venison,	1
that	1
my	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
it	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
wine	1
and	1
he	1
drank.	1
	1
27:26	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
near	1
now,	1
and	1
kiss	1
me,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
27:27	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
smelled	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
See,	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed:	1
27:28	1
Therefore	1
God	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
plenty	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine:	1
27:29	1
Let	1
people	1
serve	1
thee,	1
and	1
nations	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee:	1
be	1
lord	1
over	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
mother's	1
sons	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
thee:	1
cursed	1
be	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
curseth	1
thee,	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
blesseth	1
thee.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Isaac	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
blessing	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
Jacob	1
was	1
yet	1
scarce	1
gone	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father,	1
that	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother	1
came	1
in	1
from	1
his	1
hunting.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
had	1
made	1
savoury	1
meat,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Let	1
my	1
father	1
arise,	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
venison,	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
may	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
son,	1
thy	1
firstborn	1
Esau.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
Isaac	1
trembled	1
very	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who?	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
taken	1
venison,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
of	1
all	1
before	1
thou	1
camest,	1
and	1
have	1
blessed	1
him?	1
yea,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
27:34	1
And	1
when	1
Esau	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
exceeding	1
bitter	1
cry,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Bless	1
me,	1
even	1
me	1
also,	1
O	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
came	1
with	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
thy	1
blessing.	1
	1
27:36	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
he	1
rightly	1
named	1
Jacob?	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
supplanted	1
me	1
these	1
two	1
times:	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
birthright;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
blessing.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
reserved	1
a	1
blessing	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
Isaac	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Esau,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
thy	1
lord,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
servants;	1
and	1
with	1
corn	1
and	1
wine	1
have	1
I	1
sustained	1
him:	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
now	1
unto	1
thee,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
Esau	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
but	1
one	1
blessing,	1
my	1
father?	1
bless	1
me,	1
even	1
me	1
also,	1
O	1
my	1
father.	1
And	1
Esau	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
above;	1
27:40	1
And	1
by	1
thy	1
sword	1
shalt	1
thou	1
live,	1
and	1
shalt	1
serve	1
thy	1
brother;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
the	1
dominion,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
neck.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
Esau	1
hated	1
Jacob	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
wherewith	1
his	1
father	1
blessed	1
him:	1
and	1
Esau	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
mourning	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
are	1
at	1
hand;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
slay	1
my	1
brother	1
Jacob.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Esau	1
her	1
elder	1
son	1
were	1
told	1
to	1
Rebekah:	1
and	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Jacob	1
her	1
younger	1
son,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
brother	1
Esau,	1
as	1
touching	1
thee,	1
doth	1
comfort	1
himself,	1
purposing	1
to	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
27:43	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
obey	1
my	1
voice;	1
arise,	1
flee	1
thou	1
to	1
Laban	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
Haran;	1
27:44	1
And	1
tarry	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
until	1
thy	1
brother's	1
fury	1
turn	1
away;	1
27:45	1
Until	1
thy	1
brother's	1
anger	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
he	1
forget	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
to	1
him:	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
send,	1
and	1
fetch	1
thee	1
from	1
thence:	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
deprived	1
also	1
of	1
you	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
day?	1
	1
27:46	1
And	1
Rebekah	1
said	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
I	1
am	1
weary	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Heth:	1
if	1
Jacob	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Heth,	1
such	1
as	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
what	1
good	1
shall	1
my	1
life	1
do	1
me?	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
Isaac	1
called	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
28:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Padanaram,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
thy	1
mother's	1
father;	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
thence	1
of	1
the	1
daughers	1
of	1
Laban	1
thy	1
mother's	1
brother.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
God	1
Almighty	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people;	1
28:4	1
And	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
with	1
thee;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
inherit	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
Isaac	1
sent	1
away	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Padanaram	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
son	1
of	1
Bethuel	1
the	1
Syrian,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Rebekah,	1
Jacob's	1
and	1
Esau's	1
mother.	1
	1
28:6	1
When	1
Esau	1
saw	1
that	1
Isaac	1
had	1
blessed	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Padanaram,	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
thence;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
charge,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughers	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
28:7	1
And	1
that	1
Jacob	1
obeyed	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
Padanaram;	1
28:8	1
And	1
Esau	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan	1
pleased	1
not	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father;	1
28:9	1
Then	1
went	1
Esau	1
unto	1
Ishmael,	1
and	1
took	1
unto	1
the	1
wives	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
Mahalath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ishmael	1
Abraham's	1
son,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Nebajoth,	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
Haran.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
he	1
lighted	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
place,	1
and	1
tarried	1
there	1
all	1
night,	1
because	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
set;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
for	1
his	1
pillows,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
to	1
sleep.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
ladder	1
set	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
reached	1
to	1
heaven:	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
28:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
above	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac:	1
the	1
land	1
whereon	1
thou	1
liest,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed;	1
28:14	1
And	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
spread	1
abroad	1
to	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
south:	1
and	1
in	1
thee	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
28:15	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
again	1
into	1
this	1
land;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
thee	1
of.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
Jacob	1
awaked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
place;	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
dreadful	1
is	1
this	1
place!	1
this	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
but	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
for	1
his	1
pillows,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
pillar,	1
and	1
poured	1
oil	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
28:19	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Bethel:	1
but	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
was	1
called	1
Luz	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
28:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow,	1
saying,	1
If	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
bread	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
raiment	1
to	1
put	1
on,	1
28:21	1
So	1
that	1
I	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
in	1
peace;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
my	1
God:	1
28:22	1
And	1
this	1
stone,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
for	1
a	1
pillar,	1
shall	1
be	1
God's	1
house:	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
give	1
the	1
tenth	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
29:1	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
journey,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
east.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
he	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
lying	1
by	1
it;	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
well	1
they	1
watered	1
the	1
flocks:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
thither	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
gathered:	1
and	1
they	1
rolled	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
stone	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
brethren,	1
whence	1
be	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Of	1
Haran	1
are	1
we.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
Laban	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahor?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
29:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
he	1
well?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
well:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
cometh	1
with	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
29:7	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
high	1
day,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
cattle	1
should	1
be	1
gathered	1
together:	1
water	1
ye	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
feed	1
them.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
till	1
they	1
roll	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth;	1
then	1
we	1
water	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
29:9	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake	1
with	1
them,	1
Rachel	1
came	1
with	1
her	1
father's	1
sheep;	1
for	1
she	1
kept	1
them.	1
	1
29:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
Rachel	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
went	1
near,	1
and	1
rolled	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Laban	1
his	1
mother's	1
brother.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
Jacob	1
kissed	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
29:12	1
And	1
Jacob	1
told	1
Rachel	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
father's	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Rebekah's	1
son:	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
father.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Laban	1
heard	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
Jacob	1
his	1
sister's	1
son,	1
that	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
Laban	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
29:14	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
bone	1
and	1
my	1
flesh.	1
And	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
month.	1
	1
29:15	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Because	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
brother,	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
therefore	1
serve	1
me	1
for	1
nought?	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
shall	1
thy	1
wages	1
be?	1
	1
29:16	1
And	1
Laban	1
had	1
two	1
daughters:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
elder	1
was	1
Leah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
was	1
Rachel.	1
	1
29:17	1
Leah	1
was	1
tender	1
eyed;	1
but	1
Rachel	1
was	1
beautiful	1
and	1
well	1
favoured.	1
	1
29:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
loved	1
Rachel;	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
serve	1
thee	1
seven	1
years	1
for	1
Rachel	1
thy	1
younger	1
daughter.	1
	1
29:19	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
I	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
thee,	1
than	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
another	1
man:	1
abide	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
29:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
served	1
seven	1
years	1
for	1
Rachel;	1
and	1
they	1
seemed	1
unto	1
him	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
wife,	1
for	1
my	1
days	1
are	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
29:22	1
And	1
Laban	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
feast.	1
	1
29:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
Leah	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
29:24	1
And	1
Laban	1
gave	1
unto	1
his	1
daughter	1
Leah	1
Zilpah	1
his	1
maid	1
for	1
an	1
handmaid.	1
	1
29:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
Leah:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me?	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
Rachel?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
beguiled	1
me?	1
29:26	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
in	1
our	1
country,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
younger	1
before	1
the	1
firstborn.	1
	1
29:27	1
Fulfil	1
her	1
week,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
this	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
serve	1
with	1
me	1
yet	1
seven	1
other	1
years.	1
	1
29:28	1
And	1
Jacob	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
fulfilled	1
her	1
week:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife	1
also.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
Laban	1
gave	1
to	1
Rachel	1
his	1
daughter	1
Bilhah	1
his	1
handmaid	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
maid.	1
	1
29:30	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
unto	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
also	1
Rachel	1
more	1
than	1
Leah,	1
and	1
served	1
with	1
him	1
yet	1
seven	1
other	1
years.	1
	1
29:31	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
that	1
Leah	1
was	1
hated,	1
he	1
opened	1
her	1
womb:	1
but	1
Rachel	1
was	1
barren.	1
	1
29:32	1
And	1
Leah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Reuben:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
looked	1
upon	1
my	1
affliction;	1
now	1
therefore	1
my	1
husband	1
will	1
love	1
me.	1
	1
29:33	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
heard	1
I	1
was	1
hated,	1
he	1
hath	1
therefore	1
given	1
me	1
this	1
son	1
also:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Simeon.	1
	1
29:34	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
Now	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
my	1
husband	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
three	1
sons:	1
therefore	1
was	1
his	1
name	1
called	1
Levi.	1
	1
29:35	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Now	1
will	1
I	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Judah;	1
and	1
left	1
bearing.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
when	1
Rachel	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
no	1
children,	1
Rachel	1
envied	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Give	1
me	1
children,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
30:2	1
And	1
Jacob's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Rachel:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Am	1
I	1
in	1
God's	1
stead,	1
who	1
hath	1
withheld	1
from	1
thee	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
womb?	1
30:3	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
maid	1
Bilhah,	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
bear	1
upon	1
my	1
knees,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
children	1
by	1
her.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
Bilhah	1
her	1
handmaid	1
to	1
wife:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
Bilhah	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
judged	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
also	1
heard	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
son:	1
therefore	1
called	1
she	1
his	1
name	1
Dan.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
Bilhah	1
Rachel's	1
maid	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
second	1
son.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
With	1
great	1
wrestlings	1
have	1
I	1
wrestled	1
with	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
prevailed:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
30:9	1
When	1
Leah	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
bearing,	1
she	1
took	1
Zilpah	1
her	1
maid,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
Jacob	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
30:10	1
And	1
Zilpah	1
Leah's	1
maid	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
A	1
troop	1
cometh:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Gad.	1
	1
30:12	1
And	1
Zilpah	1
Leah's	1
maid	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
a	1
second	1
son.	1
	1
30:13	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
Happy	1
am	1
I,	1
for	1
the	1
daughters	1
will	1
call	1
me	1
blessed:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Asher.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
Reuben	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
and	1
found	1
mandrakes	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
his	1
mother	1
Leah.	1
Then	1
Rachel	1
said	1
to	1
Leah,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
thy	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
	1
30:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
matter	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
my	1
husband?	1
and	1
wouldest	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
son's	1
mandrakes	1
also?	1
And	1
Rachel	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
night	1
for	1
thy	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
Leah	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
must	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
me;	1
for	1
surely	1
I	1
have	1
hired	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
son's	1
mandrakes.	1
And	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
God	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
Leah,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
the	1
fifth	1
son.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
my	1
hire,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
maiden	1
to	1
my	1
husband:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Issachar.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
Leah	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
Jacob	1
the	1
sixth	1
son.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
Leah	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
endued	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
dowry;	1
now	1
will	1
my	1
husband	1
dwell	1
with	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
six	1
sons:	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
afterwards	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
daughter,	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
name	1
Dinah.	1
	1
30:22	1
And	1
God	1
remembered	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
God	1
hearkened	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
opened	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
30:23	1
And	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
reproach:	1
30:24	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
add	1
to	1
me	1
another	1
son.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Rachel	1
had	1
born	1
Joseph,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Laban,	1
Send	1
me	1
away,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
unto	1
mine	1
own	1
place,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
country.	1
	1
30:26	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
wives	1
and	1
my	1
children,	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go:	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
thee.	1
	1
30:27	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
tarry:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
30:28	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Appoint	1
me	1
thy	1
wages,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it.	1
	1
30:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
thee,	1
and	1
how	1
thy	1
cattle	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
30:30	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
little	1
which	1
thou	1
hadst	1
before	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
increased	1
unto	1
a	1
multitude;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
thee	1
since	1
my	1
coming:	1
and	1
now	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
provide	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
house	1
also?	1
	1
30:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee?	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
any	1
thing:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
again	1
feed	1
and	1
keep	1
thy	1
flock.	1
	1
30:32	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
all	1
thy	1
flock	1
to	1
day,	1
removing	1
from	1
thence	1
all	1
the	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
cattle	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
spotted	1
and	1
speckled	1
among	1
the	1
goats:	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
hire.	1
	1
30:33	1
So	1
shall	1
my	1
righteousness	1
answer	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
for	1
my	1
hire	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted	1
among	1
the	1
goats,	1
and	1
brown	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
stolen	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
30:34	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
would	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
30:35	1
And	1
he	1
removed	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
he	1
goats	1
that	1
were	1
ringstraked	1
and	1
spotted,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
she	1
goats	1
that	1
were	1
speckled	1
and	1
spotted,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
some	1
white	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
30:36	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
betwixt	1
himself	1
and	1
Jacob:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
fed	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Laban's	1
flocks.	1
	1
30:37	1
And	1
Jacob	1
took	1
him	1
rods	1
of	1
green	1
poplar,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
hazel	1
and	1
chesnut	1
tree;	1
and	1
pilled	1
white	1
strakes	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
white	1
appear	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
rods.	1
	1
30:38	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
rods	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
pilled	1
before	1
the	1
flocks	1
in	1
the	1
gutters	1
in	1
the	1
watering	1
troughs	1
when	1
the	1
flocks	1
came	1
to	1
drink,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
conceive	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
30:39	1
And	1
the	1
flocks	1
conceived	1
before	1
the	1
rods,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
cattle	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
spotted.	1
	1
30:40	1
And	1
Jacob	1
did	1
separate	1
the	1
lambs,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
flocks	1
toward	1
the	1
ringstraked,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brown	1
in	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Laban;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
flocks	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
not	1
unto	1
Laban's	1
cattle.	1
	1
30:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
whensoever	1
the	1
stronger	1
cattle	1
did	1
conceive,	1
that	1
Jacob	1
laid	1
the	1
rods	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
gutters,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
conceive	1
among	1
the	1
rods.	1
	1
30:42	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
cattle	1
were	1
feeble,	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
not	1
in:	1
so	1
the	1
feebler	1
were	1
Laban's,	1
and	1
the	1
stronger	1
Jacob's.	1
	1
30:43	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
increased	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
had	1
much	1
cattle,	1
and	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
camels,	1
and	1
asses.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Laban's	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
Jacob	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
our	1
father's;	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
father's	1
hath	1
he	1
gotten	1
all	1
this	1
glory.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
Jacob	1
beheld	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
Laban,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
toward	1
him	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
31:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
kindred;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
31:4	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Leah	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
unto	1
his	1
flock,	1
31:5	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
father's	1
countenance,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
toward	1
me	1
as	1
before;	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
power	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
your	1
father	1
hath	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
changed	1
my	1
wages	1
ten	1
times;	1
but	1
God	1
suffered	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
hurt	1
me.	1
	1
31:8	1
If	1
he	1
said	1
thus,	1
The	1
speckled	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
wages;	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
bare	1
speckled:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
thus,	1
The	1
ringstraked	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
hire;	1
then	1
bare	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
ringstraked.	1
	1
31:9	1
Thus	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
cattle	1
conceived,	1
that	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
rams	1
which	1
leaped	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle	1
were	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
grisled.	1
	1
31:11	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Jacob:	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see,	1
all	1
the	1
rams	1
which	1
leap	1
upon	1
the	1
cattle	1
are	1
ringstraked,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
grisled:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
Laban	1
doeth	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
31:13	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
where	1
thou	1
anointedst	1
the	1
pillar,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
vowedst	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
me:	1
now	1
arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Leah	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
portion	1
or	1
inheritance	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
father's	1
house?	1
	1
31:15	1
Are	1
we	1
not	1
counted	1
of	1
him	1
strangers?	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
sold	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
quite	1
devoured	1
also	1
our	1
money.	1
	1
31:16	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
riches	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
from	1
our	1
father,	1
that	1
is	1
ours,	1
and	1
our	1
children's:	1
now	1
then,	1
whatsoever	1
God	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
do.	1
	1
31:17	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
wives	1
upon	1
camels;	1
31:18	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
all	1
his	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
goods	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gotten,	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
his	1
getting,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
Padanaram,	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
31:19	1
And	1
Laban	1
went	1
to	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep:	1
and	1
Rachel	1
had	1
stolen	1
the	1
images	1
that	1
were	1
her	1
father's.	1
	1
31:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
stole	1
away	1
unawares	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
fled.	1
	1
31:21	1
So	1
he	1
fled	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Laban	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
that	1
Jacob	1
was	1
fled.	1
	1
31:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
brethren	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
him	1
seven	1
days'	1
journey;	1
and	1
they	1
overtook	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:24	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Laban	1
the	1
Syrian	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
thou	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
Jacob	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
31:25	1
Then	1
Laban	1
overtook	1
Jacob.	1
Now	1
Jacob	1
had	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
in	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Laban	1
with	1
his	1
brethren	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
31:26	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
stolen	1
away	1
unawares	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
my	1
daughters,	1
as	1
captives	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
sword?	1
	1
31:27	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
flee	1
away	1
secretly,	1
and	1
steal	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
and	1
didst	1
not	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
sent	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
mirth,	1
and	1
with	1
songs,	1
with	1
tabret,	1
and	1
with	1
harp?	1
31:28	1
And	1
hast	1
not	1
suffered	1
me	1
to	1
kiss	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
my	1
daughters?	1
thou	1
hast	1
now	1
done	1
foolishly	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
31:29	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
hurt:	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
yesternight,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
thou	1
heed	1
that	1
thou	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
Jacob	1
either	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
31:30	1
And	1
now,	1
though	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
needs	1
be	1
gone,	1
because	1
thou	1
sore	1
longedst	1
after	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
yet	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
stolen	1
my	1
gods?	1
	1
31:31	1
And	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
Because	1
I	1
was	1
afraid:	1
for	1
I	1
said,	1
Peradventure	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
take	1
by	1
force	1
thy	1
daughters	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
31:32	1
With	1
whomsoever	1
thou	1
findest	1
thy	1
gods,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
live:	1
before	1
our	1
brethren	1
discern	1
thou	1
what	1
is	1
thine	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
thee.	1
For	1
Jacob	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Rachel	1
had	1
stolen	1
them.	1
	1
31:33	1
And	1
Laban	1
went	1
into	1
Jacob's	1
tent,	1
and	1
into	1
Leah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
two	1
maidservants'	1
tents;	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
Leah's	1
tent,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Rachel's	1
tent.	1
	1
31:34	1
Now	1
Rachel	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
camel's	1
furniture,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
them.	1
And	1
Laban	1
searched	1
all	1
the	1
tent,	1
but	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
31:35	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
displease	1
my	1
lord	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
rise	1
up	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
women	1
is	1
upon	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
searched	1
but	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
images.	1
	1
31:36	1
And	1
Jacob	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
chode	1
with	1
Laban:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Laban,	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
trespass?	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
sin,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
hotly	1
pursued	1
after	1
me?	1
	1
31:37	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
hast	1
searched	1
all	1
my	1
stuff,	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
found	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
household	1
stuff?	1
set	1
it	1
here	1
before	1
my	1
brethren	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
judge	1
betwixt	1
us	1
both.	1
	1
31:38	1
This	1
twenty	1
years	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
with	1
thee;	1
thy	1
ewes	1
and	1
thy	1
she	1
goats	1
have	1
not	1
cast	1
their	1
young,	1
and	1
the	1
rams	1
of	1
thy	1
flock	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
eaten.	1
	1
31:39	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
torn	1
of	1
beasts	1
I	1
brought	1
not	1
unto	1
thee;	1
I	1
bare	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it;	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
didst	1
thou	1
require	1
it,	1
whether	1
stolen	1
by	1
day,	1
or	1
stolen	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
31:40	1
Thus	1
I	1
was;	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
drought	1
consumed	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
frost	1
by	1
night;	1
and	1
my	1
sleep	1
departed	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
31:41	1
Thus	1
have	1
I	1
been	1
twenty	1
years	1
in	1
thy	1
house;	1
I	1
served	1
thee	1
fourteen	1
years	1
for	1
thy	1
two	1
daughters,	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
for	1
thy	1
cattle:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
changed	1
my	1
wages	1
ten	1
times.	1
	1
31:42	1
Except	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
me,	1
surely	1
thou	1
hadst	1
sent	1
me	1
away	1
now	1
empty.	1
God	1
hath	1
seen	1
mine	1
affliction	1
and	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
thee	1
yesternight.	1
	1
31:43	1
And	1
Laban	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
These	1
daughters	1
are	1
my	1
daughters,	1
and	1
these	1
children	1
are	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
these	1
cattle	1
are	1
my	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
seest	1
is	1
mine:	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
these	1
my	1
daughters,	1
or	1
unto	1
their	1
children	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
born?	1
31:44	1
Now	1
therefore	1
come	1
thou,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
covenant,	1
I	1
and	1
thou;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
31:45	1
And	1
Jacob	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
pillar.	1
	1
31:46	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Gather	1
stones;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
stones,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
heap:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
heap.	1
	1
31:47	1
And	1
Laban	1
called	1
it	1
Jegarsahadutha:	1
but	1
Jacob	1
called	1
it	1
Galeed.	1
	1
31:48	1
And	1
Laban	1
said,	1
This	1
heap	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
Therefore	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
called	1
Galeed;	1
31:49	1
And	1
Mizpah;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
watch	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
31:50	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
afflict	1
my	1
daughters,	1
or	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
other	1
wives	1
beside	1
my	1
daughters,	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
with	1
us;	1
see,	1
God	1
is	1
witness	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
31:51	1
And	1
Laban	1
said	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
Behold	1
this	1
heap,	1
and	1
behold	1
this	1
pillar,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
cast	1
betwixt	1
me	1
and	1
thee:	1
31:52	1
This	1
heap	1
be	1
witness,	1
and	1
this	1
pillar	1
be	1
witness,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
this	1
heap	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
this	1
heap	1
and	1
this	1
pillar	1
unto	1
me,	1
for	1
harm.	1
	1
31:53	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Nahor,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
father,	1
judge	1
betwixt	1
us.	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sware	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac.	1
	1
31:54	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
brethren	1
to	1
eat	1
bread:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
tarried	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
31:55	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Laban	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them:	1
and	1
Laban	1
departed,	1
and	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
32:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
God's	1
host:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Mahanaim.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
messengers	1
before	1
him	1
to	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Seir,	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
32:4	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
Esau;	1
Thy	1
servant	1
Jacob	1
saith	1
thus,	1
I	1
have	1
sojourned	1
with	1
Laban,	1
and	1
stayed	1
there	1
until	1
now:	1
32:5	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
oxen,	1
and	1
asses,	1
flocks,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
womenservants:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
tell	1
my	1
lord,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
returned	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
saying,	1
We	1
came	1
to	1
thy	1
brother	1
Esau,	1
and	1
also	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
meet	1
thee,	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
men	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
32:7	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
was	1
greatly	1
afraid	1
and	1
distressed:	1
and	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
and	1
the	1
camels,	1
into	1
two	1
bands;	1
32:8	1
And	1
said,	1
If	1
Esau	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
company,	1
and	1
smite	1
it,	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
company	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
shall	1
escape.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Isaac,	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
saidst	1
unto	1
me,	1
Return	1
unto	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deal	1
well	1
with	1
thee:	1
32:10	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mercies,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
with	1
my	1
staff	1
I	1
passed	1
over	1
this	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
two	1
bands.	1
	1
32:11	1
Deliver	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
brother,	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Esau:	1
for	1
I	1
fear	1
him,	1
lest	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
smite	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
with	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
32:12	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
do	1
thee	1
good,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
32:13	1
And	1
he	1
lodged	1
there	1
that	1
same	1
night;	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
Esau	1
his	1
brother;	1
32:14	1
Two	1
hundred	1
she	1
goats,	1
and	1
twenty	1
he	1
goats,	1
two	1
hundred	1
ewes,	1
and	1
twenty	1
rams,	1
32:15	1
Thirty	1
milch	1
camels	1
with	1
their	1
colts,	1
forty	1
kine,	1
and	1
ten	1
bulls,	1
twenty	1
she	1
asses,	1
and	1
ten	1
foals.	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
every	1
drove	1
by	1
themselves;	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Pass	1
over	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
space	1
betwixt	1
drove	1
and	1
drove.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
foremost,	1
saying,	1
When	1
Esau	1
my	1
brother	1
meeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
asketh	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Whose	1
art	1
thou?	1
and	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whose	1
are	1
these	1
before	1
thee?	1
	1
32:18	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
They	1
be	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jacob's;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
present	1
sent	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
Esau:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
behind	1
us.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
so	1
commanded	1
he	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
droves,	1
saying,	1
On	1
this	1
manner	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
unto	1
Esau,	1
when	1
ye	1
find	1
him.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
say	1
ye	1
moreover,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jacob	1
is	1
behind	1
us.	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
appease	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
that	1
goeth	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
afterward	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
accept	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
32:21	1
So	1
went	1
the	1
present	1
over	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
himself	1
lodged	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
32:22	1
And	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
two	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
womenservants,	1
and	1
his	1
eleven	1
sons,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
ford	1
Jabbok.	1
	1
32:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
sent	1
over	1
that	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
32:24	1
And	1
Jacob	1
was	1
left	1
alone;	1
and	1
there	1
wrestled	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
the	1
breaking	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
prevailed	1
not	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
thigh;	1
and	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
thigh	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
joint,	1
as	1
he	1
wrestled	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
32:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
breaketh.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
thee	1
go,	1
except	1
thou	1
bless	1
me.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Jacob.	1
	1
32:28	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
no	1
more	1
Jacob,	1
but	1
Israel:	1
for	1
as	1
a	1
prince	1
hast	1
thou	1
power	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
hast	1
prevailed.	1
	1
32:29	1
And	1
Jacob	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
name.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
ask	1
after	1
my	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
32:30	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Peniel:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
God	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
preserved.	1
	1
32:31	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
Penuel	1
the	1
sun	1
rose	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
halted	1
upon	1
his	1
thigh.	1
	1
32:32	1
Therefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
eat	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
sinew	1
which	1
shrank,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
the	1
thigh,	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
because	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
Jacob's	1
thigh	1
in	1
the	1
sinew	1
that	1
shrank.	1
	1
33:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Esau	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
four	1
hundred	1
men.	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
Leah,	1
and	1
unto	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
two	1
handmaids.	1
	1
33:2	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
handmaids	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
foremost,	1
and	1
Leah	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
after,	1
and	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Joseph	1
hindermost.	1
	1
33:3	1
And	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
seven	1
times,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
Esau	1
ran	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
wept.	1
	1
33:5	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
children;	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
are	1
those	1
with	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
graciously	1
given	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
33:6	1
Then	1
the	1
handmaidens	1
came	1
near,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
Leah	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
children	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
after	1
came	1
Joseph	1
near	1
and	1
Rachel,	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
drove	1
which	1
I	1
met?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
to	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
33:9	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
enough,	1
my	1
brother;	1
keep	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
unto	1
thyself.	1
	1
33:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
then	1
receive	1
my	1
present	1
at	1
my	1
hand:	1
for	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
face,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
thou	1
wast	1
pleased	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
33:11	1
Take,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
my	1
blessing	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
thee;	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
graciously	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
enough.	1
And	1
he	1
urged	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
take	1
our	1
journey,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
33:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
lord	1
knoweth	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
tender,	1
and	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
with	1
young	1
are	1
with	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
men	1
should	1
overdrive	1
them	1
one	1
day,	1
all	1
the	1
flock	1
will	1
die.	1
	1
33:14	1
Let	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pass	1
over	1
before	1
his	1
servant:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
lead	1
on	1
softly,	1
according	1
as	1
the	1
cattle	1
that	1
goeth	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure,	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
unto	1
Seir.	1
	1
33:15	1
And	1
Esau	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
leave	1
with	1
thee	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
folk	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
needeth	1
it?	1
let	1
me	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
33:16	1
So	1
Esau	1
returned	1
that	1
day	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
unto	1
Seir.	1
	1
33:17	1
And	1
Jacob	1
journeyed	1
to	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
made	1
booths	1
for	1
his	1
cattle:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
is	1
called	1
Succoth.	1
	1
33:18	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
to	1
Shalem,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
Padanaram;	1
and	1
pitched	1
his	1
tent	1
before	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
33:19	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
a	1
field,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
spread	1
his	1
tent,	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Hamor,	1
Shechem's	1
father,	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
money.	1
	1
33:20	1
And	1
he	1
erected	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
EleloheIsrael.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
Dinah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Leah,	1
which	1
she	1
bare	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
34:2	1
And	1
when	1
Shechem	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hamor	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
defiled	1
her.	1
	1
34:3	1
And	1
his	1
soul	1
clave	1
unto	1
Dinah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
spake	1
kindly	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
Shechem	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
Hamor,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
me	1
this	1
damsel	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
defiled	1
Dinah	1
his	1
daughter:	1
now	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
with	1
his	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
come.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
Hamor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Shechem	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
to	1
commune	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
grieved,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
wroth,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
lying	1
with	1
Jacob's	1
daughter:	1
which	1
thing	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
34:8	1
And	1
Hamor	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
soul	1
of	1
my	1
son	1
Shechem	1
longeth	1
for	1
your	1
daughter:	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
give	1
her	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
make	1
ye	1
marriages	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
give	1
your	1
daughters	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
take	1
our	1
daughters	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
before	1
you;	1
dwell	1
and	1
trade	1
ye	1
therein,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
possessions	1
therein.	1
	1
34:11	1
And	1
Shechem	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
unto	1
her	1
brethren,	1
Let	1
me	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
give.	1
	1
34:12	1
Ask	1
me	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
dowry	1
and	1
gift,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
me:	1
but	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
damsel	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
34:13	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
answered	1
Shechem	1
and	1
Hamor	1
his	1
father	1
deceitfully,	1
and	1
said,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
defiled	1
Dinah	1
their	1
sister:	1
34:14	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
We	1
cannot	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
to	1
give	1
our	1
sister	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
uncircumcised;	1
for	1
that	1
were	1
a	1
reproach	1
unto	1
us:	1
34:15	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
consent	1
unto	1
you:	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
we	1
be,	1
that	1
every	1
male	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
34:16	1
Then	1
will	1
we	1
give	1
our	1
daughters	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
become	1
one	1
people.	1
	1
34:17	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
us,	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
take	1
our	1
daughter,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
gone.	1
	1
34:18	1
And	1
their	1
words	1
pleased	1
Hamor,	1
and	1
Shechem	1
Hamor's	1
son.	1
	1
34:19	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
deferred	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
thing,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
delight	1
in	1
Jacob's	1
daughter:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
34:20	1
And	1
Hamor	1
and	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
their	1
city,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
city,	1
saying,	1
34:21	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
peaceable	1
with	1
us;	1
therefore	1
let	1
them	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
trade	1
therein;	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
large	1
enough	1
for	1
them;	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
wives,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
give	1
them	1
our	1
daughters.	1
	1
34:22	1
Only	1
herein	1
will	1
the	1
men	1
consent	1
unto	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
us,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
people,	1
if	1
every	1
male	1
among	1
us	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
circumcised.	1
	1
34:23	1
Shall	1
not	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
and	1
every	1
beast	1
of	1
their's	1
be	1
our's?	1
only	1
let	1
us	1
consent	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
34:24	1
And	1
unto	1
Hamor	1
and	1
unto	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
hearkened	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city;	1
and	1
every	1
male	1
was	1
circumcised,	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
34:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
sore,	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi,	1
Dinah's	1
brethren,	1
took	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
city	1
boldly,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
males.	1
	1
34:26	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
Hamor	1
and	1
Shechem	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
took	1
Dinah	1
out	1
of	1
Shechem's	1
house,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
34:27	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
slain,	1
and	1
spoiled	1
the	1
city,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
defiled	1
their	1
sister.	1
	1
34:28	1
They	1
took	1
their	1
sheep,	1
and	1
their	1
oxen,	1
and	1
their	1
asses,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
34:29	1
And	1
all	1
their	1
wealth,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
took	1
they	1
captive,	1
and	1
spoiled	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
34:30	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
to	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi,	1
Ye	1
have	1
troubled	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
stink	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
among	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites:	1
and	1
I	1
being	1
few	1
in	1
number,	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
slay	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
house.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Should	1
he	1
deal	1
with	1
our	1
sister	1
as	1
with	1
an	1
harlot?	1
35:1	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
make	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
when	1
thou	1
fleddest	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Esau	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
35:2	1
Then	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
that	1
are	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
change	1
your	1
garments:	1
35:3	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
arise,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Bethel;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
God,	1
who	1
answered	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
distress,	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
went.	1
	1
35:4	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
all	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
earrings	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
ears;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
hid	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
oak	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
Shechem.	1
	1
35:5	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
and	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
pursue	1
after	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
35:6	1
So	1
Jacob	1
came	1
to	1
Luz,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
that	1
is,	1
Bethel,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:7	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
Elbethel:	1
because	1
there	1
God	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
35:8	1
But	1
Deborah	1
Rebekah's	1
nurse	1
died,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
buried	1
beneath	1
Bethel	1
under	1
an	1
oak:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Allonbachuth.	1
	1
35:9	1
And	1
God	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Padanaram,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
35:10	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
name	1
is	1
Jacob:	1
thy	1
name	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
any	1
more	1
Jacob,	1
but	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
name:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Israel.	1
	1
35:11	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
God	1
Almighty:	1
be	1
fruitful	1
and	1
multiply;	1
a	1
nation	1
and	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
kings	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
loins;	1
35:12	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
35:13	1
And	1
God	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:14	1
And	1
Jacob	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
stone:	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
thereon,	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
oil	1
thereon.	1
	1
35:15	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
God	1
spake	1
with	1
him,	1
Bethel.	1
	1
35:16	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Bethel;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Ephrath:	1
and	1
Rachel	1
travailed,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
hard	1
labour.	1
	1
35:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
hard	1
labour,	1
that	1
the	1
midwife	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
this	1
son	1
also.	1
	1
35:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
her	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
departing,	1
(for	1
she	1
died)	1
that	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Benoni:	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
called	1
him	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
35:19	1
And	1
Rachel	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Ephrath,	1
which	1
is	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
35:20	1
And	1
Jacob	1
set	1
a	1
pillar	1
upon	1
her	1
grave:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
Rachel's	1
grave	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
35:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
journeyed,	1
and	1
spread	1
his	1
tent	1
beyond	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Edar.	1
	1
35:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
that	1
land,	1
that	1
Reuben	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
Bilhah	1
his	1
father's	1
concubine:	1
and	1
Israel	1
heard	1
it.	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
were	1
twelve:	1
35:23	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Leah;	1
Reuben,	1
Jacob's	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
Simeon,	1
and	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
Zebulun:	1
35:24	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Rachel;	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
Benjamin:	1
35:25	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bilhah,	1
Rachel's	1
handmaid;	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Naphtali:	1
35:26	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zilpah,	1
Leah's	1
handmaid:	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Asher:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
Padanaram.	1
	1
35:27	1
And	1
Jacob	1
came	1
unto	1
Isaac	1
his	1
father	1
unto	1
Mamre,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Arbah,	1
which	1
is	1
Hebron,	1
where	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
sojourned.	1
	1
35:28	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Isaac	1
were	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
years.	1
	1
35:29	1
And	1
Isaac	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
being	1
old	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
days:	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
Esau	1
and	1
Jacob	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
36:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Esau,	1
who	1
is	1
Edom.	1
	1
36:2	1
Esau	1
took	1
his	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
Adah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Elon	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
Aholibamah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Anah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zibeon	1
the	1
Hivite;	1
36:3	1
And	1
Bashemath	1
Ishmael's	1
daughter,	1
sister	1
of	1
Nebajoth.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
Adah	1
bare	1
to	1
Esau	1
Eliphaz;	1
and	1
Bashemath	1
bare	1
Reuel;	1
36:5	1
And	1
Aholibamah	1
bare	1
Jeush,	1
and	1
Jaalam,	1
and	1
Korah:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Esau,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
36:6	1
And	1
Esau	1
took	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
beasts,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
substance,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
Jacob.	1
	1
36:7	1
For	1
their	1
riches	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
dwell	1
together;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
cattle.	1
	1
36:8	1
Thus	1
dwelt	1
Esau	1
in	1
mount	1
Seir:	1
Esau	1
is	1
Edom.	1
	1
36:9	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Esau	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites	1
in	1
mount	1
Seir:	1
36:10	1
These	1

wife	1
of	1
Esau,	1
Reuel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bashemath	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Esau.	1
	1
36:11	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliphaz	1
were	1
Teman,	1
Omar,	1
Zepho,	1
and	1
Gatam,	1
and	1

	1
36:12	1
And	1
Timna	1
was	1
concubine	1
to	1
Eliphaz	1
Esau's	1
son;	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
to	1
Eliphaz	1
Amalek:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Adah	1
Esau's	1

	1
36:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1

of	1
Reuel;	1
Nahath,	1
and	1

and	1

to	1
Esau	1
Jeush,	1
and	1

	1

the	1

	1
36:40	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

that	1

36:43	1
Duke	1

these	1
be	1
the	1
dukes	1
of	1
Edom,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
habitations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
possession:	1
he	1
is	1
Esau	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites.	1
	1
37:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
wherein	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
37:2	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Joseph,	1
being	1
seventeen	1
years	1
old,	1
was	1
feeding	1
the	1
flock	1
with	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Bilhah,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zilpah,	1
his	1
father's	1
wives:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
their	1
evil	1
report.	1
	1
37:3	1
Now	1
Israel	1
loved	1
Joseph	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
children,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours.	1
	1
37:4	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
loved	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
they	1
hated	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
peaceably	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
37:5	1
And	1
Joseph	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
they	1
hated	1
him	1
yet	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
37:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
this	1
dream	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed:	1
37:7	1
For,	1
behold,	1
we	1
were	1
binding	1
sheaves	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
my	1
sheaf	1
arose,	1
and	1
also	1
stood	1
upright;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
your	1
sheaves	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
made	1
obeisance	1
to	1
my	1
sheaf.	1
	1
37:8	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
indeed	1
reign	1
over	1
us?	1
or	1
shalt	1
thou	1
indeed	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
hated	1
him	1
yet	1
the	1
more	1
for	1
his	1
dreams,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
37:9	1
And	1
he	1
dreamed	1
yet	1
another	1
dream,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
more;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1
eleven	1
stars	1
made	1
obeisance	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
37:10	1
And	1
he	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
dream	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
dreamed?	1
	1
Shall	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
indeed	1
come	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
ourselves	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
37:11	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
envied	1
him;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
observed	1
the	1
saying.	1
	1
37:12	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
went	1
to	1
feed	1
their	1
father's	1
flock	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
37:13	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Do	1
not	1
thy	1
brethren	1
feed	1
the	1
flock	1
in	1
Shechem?	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
unto	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
37:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
flocks;	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again.	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Shechem.	1
	1
37:15	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
found	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
was	1
wandering	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
37:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
seek	1
my	1
brethren:	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
where	1
they	1
feed	1
their	1
flocks.	1
	1
37:17	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
departed	1
hence;	1
for	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
say,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Dothan.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
after	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
in	1
Dothan.	1
	1
37:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
before	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
conspired	1
against	1
him	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
37:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
dreamer	1
cometh.	1
	1
37:20	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
slay	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
some	1
pit,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
say,	1
Some	1
evil	1
beast	1
hath	1
devoured	1
him:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
dreams.	1
	1
37:21	1
And	1
Reuben	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
37:22	1
And	1
Reuben	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shed	1
no	1
blood,	1
but	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
pit	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
lay	1
no	1
hand	1
upon	1
him;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rid	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
again.	1
	1
37:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joseph	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
stript	1
Joseph	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
his	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
him;	1
37:24	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
pit:	1
and	1
the	1
pit	1
was	1
empty,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
37:25	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
bread:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
Ishmeelites	1
came	1
from	1
Gilead	1
with	1
their	1
camels	1
bearing	1
spicery	1
and	1
balm	1
and	1
myrrh,	1
going	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
37:26	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
What	1
profit	1
is	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
slay	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
conceal	1
his	1
blood?	1
	1
37:27	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
sell	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Ishmeelites,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
our	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
brother	1
and	1
our	1
flesh.	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
content.	1
	1
37:28	1
Then	1
there	1
passed	1
by	1
Midianites	1
merchantmen;	1
and	1
they	1
drew	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
Joseph	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
to	1
the	1
Ishmeelites	1
for	1
twenty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
37:29	1
And	1
Reuben	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
pit;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Joseph	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
pit;	1
and	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
37:30	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
child	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
I,	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go?	1
	1
37:31	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Joseph's	1
coat,	1
and	1
killed	1
a	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats,	1
and	1
dipped	1
the	1
coat	1
in	1
the	1
blood;	1
37:32	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
the	1
coat	1
of	1
many	1
colours,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
their	1
father;	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
have	1
we	1
found:	1
know	1
now	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
thy	1
son's	1
coat	1
or	1
no.	1
	1
37:33	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
son's	1
coat;	1
an	1
evil	1
beast	1
hath	1
devoured	1
him;	1
Joseph	1
is	1
without	1
doubt	1
rent	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
37:34	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
put	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
mourned	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
37:35	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
daughters	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
comfort	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
comforted;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
grave	1
unto	1
my	1
son	1
mourning.	1
Thus	1
his	1
father	1
wept	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
37:36	1
And	1
the	1
Midianites	1
sold	1
him	1
into	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
Potiphar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
Pharaoh's,	1
and	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard.	1
	1
38:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
Judah	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
turned	1
in	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
Adullamite,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Hirah.	1
	1
38:2	1
And	1
Judah	1
saw	1
there	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
Canaanite,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Shuah;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
38:3	1
And	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Er.	1
	1
38:4	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Onan.	1
	1
38:5	1
And	1
she	1
yet	1
again	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Shelah:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Chezib,	1
when	1
she	1
bare	1
him.	1
	1
38:6	1
And	1
Judah	1
took	1
a	1
wife	1
for	1
Er	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar.	1
	1
38:7	1
And	1
Er,	1
Judah's	1
firstborn,	1
was	1
wicked	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
38:8	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
Onan,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
thy	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
and	1
marry	1
her,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
to	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
38:9	1
And	1
Onan	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
his;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
that	1
he	1
spilled	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
lest	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
seed	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
38:10	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
slew	1
him	1
also.	1
	1
38:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Judah	1
to	1
Tamar	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Remain	1
a	1
widow	1
at	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
till	1
Shelah	1
my	1
son	1
be	1
grown:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
he	1
die	1
also,	1
as	1
his	1
brethren	1
did.	1
And	1
Tamar	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
38:12	1
And	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Shuah	1
Judah's	1
wife	1
died;	1
and	1
Judah	1
was	1
comforted,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
his	1
sheepshearers	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
Hirah	1
the	1
Adullamite.	1
	1
38:13	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Tamar,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
Timnath	1
to	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep.	1
	1
38:14	1
And	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
widow's	1
garments	1
off	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
covered	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
vail,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
herself,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
open	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Timnath;	1
for	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Shelah	1
was	1
grown,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
38:15	1
When	1
Judah	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
harlot;	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
covered	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
38:16	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
unto	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
to,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
thee;	1
(for	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law.)	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
38:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
a	1
kid	1
from	1
the	1
flock.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
pledge,	1
till	1
thou	1
send	1
it?	1
	1
38:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
pledge	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Thy	1
signet,	1
and	1
thy	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
thy	1
staff	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
her,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
conceived	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
38:19	1
And	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
laid	1
by	1
her	1
vail	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
her	1
widowhood.	1
	1
38:20	1
And	1
Judah	1
sent	1
the	1
kid	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Adullamite,	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
pledge	1
from	1
the	1
woman's	1
hand:	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
38:21	1
Then	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
harlot,	1
that	1
was	1
openly	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
harlot	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
38:22	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
her;	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
said,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harlot	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
38:23	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
her,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
shamed:	1
behold,	1
I	1
sent	1
this	1
kid,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
found	1
her.	1
	1
38:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
three	1
months	1
after,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Tamar	1
thy	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot;	1
and	1
also,	1
behold,	1
she	1
is	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
whoredom.	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Bring	1
her	1
forth,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
burnt.	1
	1
38:25	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
brought	1
forth,	1
she	1
sent	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
saying,	1
By	1
the	1
man,	1
whose	1
these	1
are,	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
child:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Discern,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
whose	1
are	1
these,	1
the	1
signet,	1
and	1
bracelets,	1
and	1
staff.	1
	1
38:26	1
And	1
Judah	1
acknowledged	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
She	1
hath	1
been	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
I;	1
because	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
Shelah	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
again	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
38:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
travail,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
twins	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
38:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
travailed,	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
the	1
midwife	1
took	1
and	1
bound	1
upon	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
scarlet	1
thread,	1
saying,	1
This	1
came	1
out	1
first.	1
	1
38:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
his	1
hand,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
his	1
brother	1
came	1
out:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
How	1
hast	1
thou	1
broken	1
forth?	1
this	1
breach	1
be	1
upon	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Pharez.	1
	1
38:30	1
And	1
afterward	1
came	1
out	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
scarlet	1
thread	1
upon	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Zarah.	1
	1
39:1	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
Potiphar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
bought	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Ishmeelites,	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
thither.	1
	1
39:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prosperous	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
the	1
Egyptian.	1
	1
39:3	1
And	1
his	1
master	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
39:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
he	1
served	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
overseer	1
over	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
he	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
39:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
overseer	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
Egyptian's	1
house	1
for	1
Joseph's	1
sake;	1
and	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
39:6	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
Joseph's	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
ought	1
he	1
had,	1
save	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
person,	1
and	1
well	1
favoured.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
his	1
master's	1
wife	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Lie	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
39:8	1
But	1
he	1
refused,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master's	1
wife,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
master	1
wotteth	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
committed	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
to	1
my	1
hand;	1
39:9	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
greater	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
than	1
I;	1
neither	1
hath	1
he	1
kept	1
back	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
his	1
wife:	1
how	1
then	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
great	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
sin	1
against	1
God?	1
	1
39:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
spake	1
to	1
Joseph	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
her,	1
to	1
lie	1
by	1
her,	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
39:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
this	1
time,	1
that	1
Joseph	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
business;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
within.	1
	1
39:12	1
And	1
she	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
garment,	1
saying,	1
Lie	1
with	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
39:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
was	1
fled	1
forth,	1
39:14	1
That	1
she	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
her	1
house,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
See,	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
in	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
mock	1
us;	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
lie	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
39:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
cried,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
39:16	1
And	1
she	1
laid	1
up	1
his	1
garment	1
by	1
her,	1
until	1
his	1
lord	1
came	1
home.	1
	1
39:17	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Hebrew	1
servant,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
unto	1
us,	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
mock	1
me:	1
39:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
voice	1
and	1
cried,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
garment	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
fled	1
out.	1
	1
39:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
which	1
she	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
thy	1
servant	1
to	1
me;	1
that	1
his	1
wrath	1
was	1
kindled.	1
	1
39:20	1
And	1
Joseph's	1
master	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
prison,	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
king's	1
prisoners	1
were	1
bound:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
39:21	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
mercy,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
39:22	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
committed	1
to	1
Joseph's	1
hand	1
all	1
the	1
prisoners	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
prison;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
did	1
there,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
doer	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
39:23	1
The	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
looked	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
hand;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
prosper.	1
	1
40:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
the	1
butler	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
his	1
baker	1
had	1
offended	1
their	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
40:2	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
wroth	1
against	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
officers,	1
against	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
butlers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
bakers.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
ward	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
into	1
the	1
prison,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Joseph	1
was	1
bound.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
charged	1
Joseph	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
served	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
a	1
season	1
in	1
ward.	1
	1
40:5	1
And	1
they	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
dream	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
his	1
dream,	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
the	1
baker	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
40:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
them,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
sad.	1
	1
40:7	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
Pharaoh's	1
officers	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ward	1
of	1
his	1
lord's	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
sadly	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
40:8	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
interpreter	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
not	1
interpretations	1
belong	1
to	1
God?	1
tell	1
me	1
them,	1
I	1
pray	1
you.	1
	1
40:9	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
told	1
his	1
dream	1
to	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
In	1
my	1
dream,	1
behold,	1
a	1
vine	1
was	1
before	1
me;	1
40:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
vine	1
were	1
three	1
branches:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
budded,	1
and	1
her	1
blossoms	1
shot	1
forth;	1
and	1
the	1
clusters	1
thereof	1
brought	1
forth	1
ripe	1
grapes:	1
40:11	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
hand:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
grapes,	1
and	1
pressed	1
them	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup,	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
cup	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
hand.	1
	1
40:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
it:	1
The	1
three	1
branches	1
are	1
three	1
days:	1
40:13	1
Yet	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
lift	1
up	1
thine	1
head,	1
and	1
restore	1
thee	1
unto	1
thy	1
place:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
Pharaoh's	1
cup	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
after	1
the	1
former	1
manner	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
his	1
butler.	1
	1
40:14	1
But	1
think	1
on	1
me	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
kindness,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
me	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house:	1
40:15	1
For	1
indeed	1
I	1
was	1
stolen	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews:	1
and	1
here	1
also	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
nothing	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
dungeon.	1
	1
40:16	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
baker	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
interpretation	1
was	1
good,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
had	1
three	1
white	1
baskets	1
on	1
my	1
head:	1
40:17	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
uppermost	1
basket	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
bakemeats	1
for	1
Pharaoh;	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
did	1
eat	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
upon	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
40:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof:	1
The	1
three	1
baskets	1
are	1
three	1
days:	1
40:19	1
Yet	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
head	1
from	1
off	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
hang	1
thee	1
on	1
a	1
tree;	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
shall	1
eat	1
thy	1
flesh	1
from	1
off	1
thee.	1
	1
40:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
Pharaoh's	1
birthday,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
baker	1
among	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
40:21	1
And	1
he	1
restored	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
unto	1
his	1
butlership	1
again;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
cup	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
hand:	1
40:22	1
But	1
he	1
hanged	1
the	1
chief	1
baker:	1
as	1
Joseph	1
had	1
interpreted	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
40:23	1
Yet	1
did	1
not	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
remember	1
Joseph,	1
but	1
forgat	1
him.	1
	1
41:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
full	1
years,	1
that	1
Pharaoh	1
dreamed:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
41:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
seven	1
well	1
favoured	1
kine	1
and	1
fatfleshed;	1
and	1
they	1
fed	1
in	1
a	1
meadow.	1
	1
41:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
other	1
kine	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed;	1
and	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
kine	1
upon	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
41:4	1
And	1
the	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed	1
kine	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
seven	1
well	1
favoured	1
and	1
fat	1
kine.	1
So	1
Pharaoh	1
awoke.	1
	1
41:5	1
And	1
he	1
slept	1
and	1
dreamed	1
the	1
second	1
time:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
came	1
up	1
upon	1
one	1
stalk,	1
rank	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
41:6	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
thin	1
ears	1
and	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
sprung	1
up	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
41:7	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
thin	1
ears	1
devoured	1
the	1
seven	1
rank	1
and	1
full	1
ears.	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
awoke,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
41:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
thereof:	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
told	1
them	1
his	1
dream;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
interpret	1
them	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
chief	1
butler	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
I	1
do	1
remember	1
my	1
faults	1
this	1
day:	1
41:10	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
ward	1
in	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard's	1
house,	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
baker:	1
41:11	1
And	1
we	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream	1
in	1
one	1
night,	1
I	1
and	1
he;	1
we	1
dreamed	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
his	1
dream.	1
	1
41:12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
an	1
Hebrew,	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard;	1
and	1
we	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
interpreted	1
to	1
us	1
our	1
dreams;	1
to	1
each	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
dream	1
he	1
did	1
interpret.	1
	1
41:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
interpreted	1
to	1
us,	1
so	1
it	1
was;	1
me	1
he	1
restored	1
unto	1
mine	1
office,	1
and	1
him	1
he	1
hanged.	1
	1
41:14	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
hastily	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dungeon:	1
and	1
he	1
shaved	1
himself,	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:15	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
can	1
interpret	1
it:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
understand	1
a	1
dream	1
to	1
interpret	1
it.	1
	1
41:16	1
And	1
Joseph	1
answered	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
me:	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
Pharaoh	1
an	1
answer	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
41:17	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
In	1
my	1
dream,	1
behold,	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river:	1
41:18	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
seven	1
kine,	1
fatfleshed	1
and	1
well	1
favoured;	1
and	1
they	1
fed	1
in	1
a	1
meadow:	1
41:19	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
other	1
kine	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them,	1
poor	1
and	1
very	1
ill	1
favoured	1
and	1
leanfleshed,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
badness:	1
41:20	1
And	1
the	1
lean	1
and	1
the	1
ill	1
favoured	1
kine	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
first	1
seven	1
fat	1
kine:	1
41:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
them	1
up,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
ill	1
favoured,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
So	1
I	1
awoke.	1
	1
41:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
dream,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
one	1
stalk,	1
full	1
and	1
good:	1
41:23	1
And,	1
behold,	1
seven	1
ears,	1
withered,	1
thin,	1
and	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind,	1
sprung	1
up	1
after	1
them:	1
41:24	1
And	1
the	1
thin	1
ears	1
devoured	1
the	1
seven	1
good	1
ears:	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
this	1
unto	1
the	1
magicians;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
declare	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
41:25	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
The	1
dream	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
is	1
one:	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
Pharaoh	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
41:26	1
The	1
seven	1
good	1
kine	1
are	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
good	1
ears	1
are	1
seven	1
years:	1
the	1
dream	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
41:27	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
thin	1
and	1
ill	1
favoured	1
kine	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
them	1
are	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
empty	1
ears	1
blasted	1
with	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine.	1
	1
41:28	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
What	1
God	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
do	1
he	1
sheweth	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
41:29	1
Behold,	1
there	1
come	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
great	1
plenty	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
41:30	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
after	1
them	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
plenty	1
shall	1
be	1
forgotten	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
famine	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
land;	1
41:31	1
And	1
the	1
plenty	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
that	1
famine	1
following;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
grievous.	1
	1
41:32	1
And	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
dream	1
was	1
doubled	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
twice;	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
established	1
by	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
shortly	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
41:33	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
Pharaoh	1
look	1
out	1
a	1
man	1
discreet	1
and	1
wise,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:34	1
Let	1
Pharaoh	1
do	1
this,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
appoint	1
officers	1
over	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
plenteous	1
years.	1
	1
41:35	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
gather	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
those	1
good	1
years	1
that	1
come,	1
and	1
lay	1
up	1
corn	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
keep	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cities.	1
	1
41:36	1
And	1
that	1
food	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
store	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
against	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
perish	1
not	1
through	1
the	1
famine.	1
	1
41:37	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
41:38	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Can	1
we	1
find	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
this	1
is,	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
is?	1
	1
41:39	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
thee	1
all	1
this,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
so	1
discreet	1
and	1
wise	1
as	1
thou	1
art:	1
41:40	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
thy	1
word	1
shall	1
all	1
my	1
people	1
be	1
ruled:	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
thou.	1
	1
41:41	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:42	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
Joseph's	1
hand,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
him	1
in	1
vestures	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
gold	1
chain	1
about	1
his	1
neck;	1
41:43	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
ride	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
which	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
before	1
him,	1
Bow	1
the	1
knee:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:44	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
am	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
without	1
thee	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
or	1
foot	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:45	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
Joseph's	1
name	1
Zaphnathpaaneah;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
wife	1
Asenath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Potipherah	1
priest	1
of	1
On.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
out	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:46	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
thirty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:47	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
plenteous	1
years	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
by	1
handfuls.	1
	1
41:48	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
years,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
laid	1
up	1
the	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
cities:	1
the	1
food	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
which	1
was	1
round	1
about	1
every	1
city,	1
laid	1
he	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
41:49	1
And	1
Joseph	1
gathered	1
corn	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
very	1
much,	1
until	1
he	1
left	1
numbering;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
without	1
number.	1
	1
41:50	1
And	1
unto	1
Joseph	1
were	1
born	1
two	1
sons	1
before	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
famine	1
came,	1
which	1
Asenath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Potipherah	1
priest	1
of	1
On	1
bare	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
41:51	1
And	1
Joseph	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
Manasseh:	1
For	1
God,	1
said	1
he,	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
all	1
my	1
toil,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
41:52	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
called	1
he	1
Ephraim:	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
fruitful	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
41:53	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
plenteousness,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
were	1
ended.	1
	1
41:54	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
dearth	1
began	1
to	1
come,	1
according	1
as	1
Joseph	1
had	1
said:	1
and	1
the	1
dearth	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
lands;	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
there	1
was	1
bread.	1
	1
41:55	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
was	1
famished,	1
the	1
people	1
cried	1
to	1
Pharaoh	1
for	1
bread:	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
Go	1
unto	1
Joseph;	1
what	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
you,	1
do.	1
	1
41:56	1
And	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
opened	1
all	1
the	1
storehouses,	1
and	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
the	1
famine	1
waxed	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
41:57	1
And	1
all	1
countries	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt	1
to	1
Joseph	1
for	1
to	1
buy	1
corn;	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
so	1
sore	1
in	1
all	1
lands.	1
	1
42:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Jacob	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
look	1
one	1
upon	1
another?	1
	1
42:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
get	1
you	1
down	1
thither,	1
and	1
buy	1
for	1
us	1
from	1
thence;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
42:3	1
And	1
Joseph's	1
ten	1
brethren	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
buy	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt.	1
	1
42:4	1
But	1
Benjamin,	1
Joseph's	1
brother,	1
Jacob	1
sent	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
brethren;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him.	1
	1
42:5	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
buy	1
corn	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
came:	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
42:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
was	1
the	1
governor	1
over	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
sold	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
came,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
themselves	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
42:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
them,	1
but	1
made	1
himself	1
strange	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
roughly	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whence	1
come	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
From	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
to	1
buy	1
food.	1
	1
42:8	1
And	1
Joseph	1
knew	1
his	1
brethren,	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
him.	1
	1
42:9	1
And	1
Joseph	1
remembered	1
the	1
dreams	1
which	1
he	1
dreamed	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
spies;	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
ye	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
42:10	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
lord,	1
but	1
to	1
buy	1
food	1
are	1
thy	1
servants	1
come.	1
	1
42:11	1
We	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
man's	1
sons;	1
we	1
are	1
true	1
men,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
no	1
spies.	1
	1
42:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nay,	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
ye	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
42:13	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
are	1
twelve	1
brethren,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
youngest	1
is	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
our	1
father,	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
not.	1
	1
42:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
That	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
are	1
spies:	1
42:15	1
Hereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
proved:	1
By	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
forth	1
hence,	1
except	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
42:16	1
Send	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
fetch	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
prison,	1
that	1
your	1
words	1
may	1
be	1
proved,	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
truth	1
in	1
you:	1
or	1
else	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
surely	1
ye	1
are	1
spies.	1
	1
42:17	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
together	1
into	1
ward	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
42:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
This	1
do,	1
and	1
live;	1
for	1
I	1
fear	1
God:	1
42:19	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
true	1
men,	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
prison:	1
go	1
ye,	1
carry	1
corn	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
of	1
your	1
houses:	1
42:20	1
But	1
bring	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
unto	1
me;	1
so	1
shall	1
your	1
words	1
be	1
verified,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
42:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
We	1
are	1
verily	1
guilty	1
concerning	1
our	1
brother,	1
in	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
anguish	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
when	1
he	1
besought	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
therefore	1
is	1
this	1
distress	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
42:22	1
And	1
Reuben	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Spake	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
not	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
hear?	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
also	1
his	1
blood	1
is	1
required.	1
	1
42:23	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Joseph	1
understood	1
them;	1
for	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
an	1
interpreter.	1
	1
42:24	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
himself	1
about	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
wept;	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
them	1
Simeon,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
42:25	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
commanded	1
to	1
fill	1
their	1
sacks	1
with	1
corn,	1
and	1
to	1
restore	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
into	1
his	1
sack,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
he	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
42:26	1
And	1
they	1
laded	1
their	1
asses	1
with	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
42:27	1
And	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
opened	1
his	1
sack	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
ass	1
provender	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
he	1
espied	1
his	1
money;	1
for,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
sack's	1
mouth.	1
	1
42:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
My	1
money	1
is	1
restored;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
sack:	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
failed	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
	1
42:29	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
befell	1
unto	1
them;	1
saying,	1
42:30	1
The	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
spake	1
roughly	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
us	1
for	1
spies	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
42:31	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
true	1
men;	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
spies:	1
42:32	1
We	1
be	1
twelve	1
brethren,	1
sons	1
of	1
our	1
father;	1
one	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
is	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
our	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
42:33	1
And	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Hereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
true	1
men;	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
here	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
food	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
of	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
be	1
gone:	1
42:34	1
And	1
bring	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
unto	1
me:	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
spies,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
true	1
men:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
you	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
traffick	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
42:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
emptied	1
their	1
sacks,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
bundle	1
of	1
money	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
sack:	1
and	1
when	1
both	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
saw	1
the	1
bundles	1
of	1
money,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
42:36	1
And	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Me	1
have	1
ye	1
bereaved	1
of	1
my	1
children:	1
Joseph	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
will	1
take	1
Benjamin	1
away:	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
42:37	1
And	1
Reuben	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
saying,	1
Slay	1
my	1
two	1
sons,	1
if	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
thee:	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
thee	1
again.	1
	1
42:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
My	1
son	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
you;	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
left	1
alone:	1
if	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
go,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
gray	1
hairs	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
43:1	1
And	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
43:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
up	1
the	1
corn	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
their	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
again,	1
buy	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
food.	1
	1
43:3	1
And	1
Judah	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
The	1
man	1
did	1
solemnly	1
protest	1
unto	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
your	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
43:4	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send	1
our	1
brother	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
buy	1
thee	1
food:	1
43:5	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
send	1
him,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
down:	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
your	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
43:6	1
And	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
dealt	1
ye	1
so	1
ill	1
with	1
me,	1
as	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
man	1
whether	1
ye	1
had	1
yet	1
a	1
brother?	1
	1
43:7	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
man	1
asked	1
us	1
straitly	1
of	1
our	1
state,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
kindred,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
your	1
father	1
yet	1
alive?	1
have	1
ye	1
another	1
brother?	1
and	1
we	1
told	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
these	1
words:	1
could	1
we	1
certainly	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
say,	1
Bring	1
your	1
brother	1
down?	1
	1
43:8	1
And	1
Judah	1
said	1
unto	1
Israel	1
his	1
father,	1
Send	1
the	1
lad	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
thou,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
43:9	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
surety	1
for	1
him;	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
shalt	1
thou	1
require	1
him:	1
if	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
thee,	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
bear	1
the	1
blame	1
for	1
ever:	1
43:10	1
For	1
except	1
we	1
had	1
lingered,	1
surely	1
now	1
we	1
had	1
returned	1
this	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
43:11	1
And	1
their	1
father	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
now,	1
do	1
this;	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
fruits	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
your	1
vessels,	1
and	1
carry	1
down	1
the	1
man	1
a	1
present,	1
a	1
little	1
balm,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
honey,	1
spices,	1
and	1
myrrh,	1
nuts,	1
and	1
almonds:	1
43:12	1
And	1
take	1
double	1
money	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
your	1
sacks,	1
carry	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
peradventure	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
oversight:	1
43:13	1
Take	1
also	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
man:	1
43:14	1
And	1
God	1
Almighty	1
give	1
you	1
mercy	1
before	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
send	1
away	1
your	1
other	1
brother,	1
and	1
Benjamin.	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
bereaved	1
of	1
my	1
children,	1
I	1
am	1
bereaved.	1
	1
43:15	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
took	1
that	1
present,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
double	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
and	1
Benjamin;	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
Joseph.	1
	1
43:16	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
Benjamin	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
Bring	1
these	1
men	1
home,	1
and	1
slay,	1
and	1
make	1
ready;	1
for	1
these	1
men	1
shall	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
noon.	1
	1
43:17	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
did	1
as	1
Joseph	1
bade;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
brought	1
the	1
men	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house.	1
	1
43:18	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
afraid,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
returned	1
in	1
our	1
sacks	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
are	1
we	1
brought	1
in;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
seek	1
occasion	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
take	1
us	1
for	1
bondmen,	1
and	1
our	1
asses.	1
	1
43:19	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
Joseph's	1
house,	1
and	1
they	1
communed	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
43:20	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
sir,	1
we	1
came	1
indeed	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
to	1
buy	1
food:	1
43:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
inn,	1
that	1
we	1
opened	1
our	1
sacks,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
sack,	1
our	1
money	1
in	1
full	1
weight:	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
brought	1
it	1
again	1
in	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
43:22	1
And	1
other	1
money	1
have	1
we	1
brought	1
down	1
in	1
our	1
hands	1
to	1
buy	1
food:	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
who	1
put	1
our	1
money	1
in	1
our	1
sacks.	1
	1
43:23	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
you,	1
fear	1
not:	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
father,	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
treasure	1
in	1
your	1
sacks:	1
I	1
had	1
your	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
Simeon	1
out	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
43:24	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
brought	1
the	1
men	1
into	1
Joseph's	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
water,	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
asses	1
provender.	1
	1
43:25	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
present	1
against	1
Joseph	1
came	1
at	1
noon:	1
for	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
eat	1
bread	1
there.	1
	1
43:26	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
came	1
home,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
present	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
43:27	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
welfare,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
your	1
father	1
well,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
spake?	1
Is	1
he	1
yet	1
alive?	1
	1
43:28	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
our	1
father	1
is	1
in	1
good	1
health,	1
he	1
is	1
yet	1
alive.	1
And	1
they	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
made	1
obeisance.	1
	1
43:29	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
his	1
brother	1
Benjamin,	1
his	1
mother's	1
son,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
younger	1
brother,	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
spake	1
unto	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
God	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
43:30	1
And	1
Joseph	1
made	1
haste;	1
for	1
his	1
bowels	1
did	1
yearn	1
upon	1
his	1
brother:	1
and	1
he	1
sought	1
where	1
to	1
weep;	1
and	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
wept	1
there.	1
	1
43:31	1
And	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
refrained	1
himself,	1
and	1
said,	1
Set	1
on	1
bread.	1
	1
43:32	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
on	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
him,	1
by	1
themselves:	1
because	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
might	1
not	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
43:33	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
before	1
him,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
birthright,	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
youth:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
marvelled	1
one	1
at	1
another.	1
	1
43:34	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
and	1
sent	1
messes	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
but	1
Benjamin's	1
mess	1
was	1
five	1
times	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
their's.	1
And	1
they	1
drank,	1
and	1
were	1
merry	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
44:1	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Fill	1
the	1
men's	1
sacks	1
with	1
food,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
carry,	1
and	1
put	1
every	1
man's	1
money	1
in	1
his	1
sack's	1
mouth.	1
	1
44:2	1
And	1
put	1
my	1
cup,	1
the	1
silver	1
cup,	1
in	1
the	1
sack's	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
youngest,	1
and	1
his	1
corn	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Joseph	1
had	1
spoken.	1
	1
44:3	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
light,	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
sent	1
away,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
asses.	1
	1
44:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
not	1
yet	1
far	1
off,	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
steward,	1
Up,	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
men;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
dost	1
overtake	1
them,	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
rewarded	1
evil	1
for	1
good?	1
	1
44:5	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
it	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
lord	1
drinketh,	1
and	1
whereby	1
indeed	1
he	1
divineth?	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
evil	1
in	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
44:6	1
And	1
he	1
overtook	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
these	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
44:7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
saith	1
my	1
lord	1
these	1
words?	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
thy	1
servants	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
thing:	1
44:8	1
Behold,	1
the	1
money,	1
which	1
we	1
found	1
in	1
our	1
sacks'	1
mouths,	1
we	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
how	1
then	1
should	1
we	1
steal	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
lord's	1
house	1
silver	1
or	1
gold?	1
	1
44:9	1
With	1
whomsoever	1
of	1
thy	1
servants	1
it	1
be	1
found,	1
both	1
let	1
him	1
die,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
lord's	1
bondmen.	1
	1
44:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
also	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
according	1
unto	1
your	1
words:	1
he	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
found	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
44:11	1
Then	1
they	1
speedily	1
took	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sack	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
opened	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sack.	1
	1
44:12	1
And	1
he	1
searched,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
and	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
youngest:	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
Benjamin's	1
sack.	1
	1
44:13	1
Then	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
laded	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
44:14	1
And	1
Judah	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
came	1
to	1
Joseph's	1
house;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
before	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
44:15	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
deed	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
done?	1
wot	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
certainly	1
divine?	1
	1
44:16	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
lord?	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
speak?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
clear	1
ourselves?	1
God	1
hath	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
servants:	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
my	1
lord's	1
servants,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
cup	1
is	1
found.	1
	1
44:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
so:	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
the	1
cup	1
is	1
found,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
get	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
peace	1
unto	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
44:18	1
Then	1
Judah	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh	1
my	1
lord,	1
let	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
my	1
lord's	1
ears,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thine	1
anger	1
burn	1
against	1
thy	1
servant:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
even	1
as	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
44:19	1
My	1
lord	1
asked	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
ye	1
a	1
father,	1
or	1
a	1
brother?	1
	1
44:20	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
father,	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
a	1
little	1
one;	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
loveth	1
him.	1
	1
44:21	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
Bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
44:22	1
And	1
we	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
The	1
lad	1
cannot	1
leave	1
his	1
father:	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
leave	1
his	1
father,	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
die.	1
	1
44:23	1
And	1
thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
Except	1
your	1
youngest	1
brother	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
44:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father,	1
we	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
44:25	1
And	1
our	1
father	1
said,	1
Go	1
again,	1
and	1
buy	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
food.	1
	1
44:26	1
And	1
we	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot	1
go	1
down:	1
if	1
our	1
youngest	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
go	1
down:	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
man's	1
face,	1
except	1
our	1
youngest	1
brother	1
be	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
44:27	1
And	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
bare	1
me	1
two	1
sons:	1
44:28	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
he	1
is	1
torn	1
in	1
pieces;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
not	1
since:	1
44:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
take	1
this	1
also	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
mischief	1
befall	1
him,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
gray	1
hairs	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
44:30	1
Now	1
therefore	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thy	1
servant	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
be	1
not	1
with	1
us;	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
lad's	1
life;	1
44:31	1
It	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
that	1
the	1
lad	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
die:	1
and	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
gray	1
hairs	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
our	1
father	1
with	1
sorrow	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
	1
44:32	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
became	1
surety	1
for	1
the	1
lad	1
unto	1
my	1
father,	1
saying,	1
If	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
blame	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
44:33	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
thy	1
servant	1
abide	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
a	1
bondman	1
to	1
my	1
lord;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
lad	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
44:34	1
For	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
lad	1
be	1
not	1
with	1
me?	1
lest	1
peradventure	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
on	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
45:1	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
himself	1
before	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
Cause	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
me.	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
no	1
man	1
with	1
him,	1
while	1
Joseph	1
made	1
himself	1
known	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
45:2	1
And	1
he	1
wept	1
aloud:	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
heard.	1
	1
45:3	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
Joseph;	1
doth	1
my	1
father	1
yet	1
live?	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
45:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Come	1
near	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
near.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Joseph	1
your	1
brother,	1
whom	1
ye	1
sold	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
45:5	1
Now	1
therefore	1
be	1
not	1
grieved,	1
nor	1
angry	1
with	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
sold	1
me	1
hither:	1
for	1
God	1
did	1
send	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
preserve	1
life.	1
	1
45:6	1
For	1
these	1
two	1
years	1
hath	1
the	1
famine	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
earing	1
nor	1
harvest.	1
	1
45:7	1
And	1
God	1
sent	1
me	1
before	1
you	1
to	1
preserve	1
you	1
a	1
posterity	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
lives	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
deliverance.	1
	1
45:8	1
So	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
you	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
hither,	1
but	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
a	1
ruler	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
45:9	1
Haste	1
ye,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
son	1
Joseph,	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
Egypt:	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
tarry	1
not:	1
45:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
near	1
unto	1
me,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
children's	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
flocks,	1
and	1
thy	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast:	1
45:11	1
And	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
nourish	1
thee;	1
for	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
famine;	1
lest	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
household,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
come	1
to	1
poverty.	1
	1
45:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
your	1
eyes	1
see,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
my	1
brother	1
Benjamin,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
mouth	1
that	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
45:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
tell	1
my	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
glory	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
seen;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
haste	1
and	1
bring	1
down	1
my	1
father	1
hither.	1
	1
45:14	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
brother	1
Benjamin's	1
neck,	1
and	1
wept;	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
wept	1
upon	1
his	1
neck.	1
	1
45:15	1
Moreover	1
he	1
kissed	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wept	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
his	1
brethren	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
45:16	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
thereof	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
are	1
come:	1
and	1
it	1
pleased	1
Pharaoh	1
well,	1
and	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
45:17	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Say	1
unto	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
This	1
do	1
ye;	1
lade	1
your	1
beasts,	1
and	1
go,	1
get	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
45:18	1
And	1
take	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
45:19	1
Now	1
thou	1
art	1
commanded,	1
this	1
do	1
ye;	1
take	1
you	1
wagons	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
come.	1
	1
45:20	1
Also	1
regard	1
not	1
your	1
stuff;	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
is	1
your's.	1
	1
45:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
gave	1
them	1
wagons,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:22	1
To	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
gave	1
each	1
man	1
changes	1
of	1
raiment;	1
but	1
to	1
Benjamin	1
he	1
gave	1
three	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
five	1
changes	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
45:23	1
And	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
he	1
sent	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
ten	1
asses	1
laden	1
with	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ten	1
she	1
asses	1
laden	1
with	1
corn	1
and	1
bread	1
and	1
meat	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:24	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
brethren	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
departed:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
fall	1
not	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
45:25	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father,	1
45:26	1
And	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Joseph	1
is	1
yet	1
alive,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
governor	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
And	1
Jacob's	1
heart	1
fainted,	1
for	1
he	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
45:27	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wagons	1
which	1
Joseph	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
carry	1
him,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father	1
revived:	1
45:28	1
And	1
Israel	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
enough;	1
Joseph	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
yet	1
alive:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
I	1
die.	1
	1
46:1	1
And	1
Israel	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Isaac.	1
	1
46:2	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
Jacob,	1
Jacob.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
46:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father:	1
fear	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
there	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation:	1
46:4	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
surely	1
bring	1
thee	1
up	1
again:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
46:5	1
And	1
Jacob	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
Beersheba:	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Israel	1
carried	1
Jacob	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
in	1
the	1
wagons	1
which	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
sent	1
to	1
carry	1
him.	1
	1
46:6	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
cattle,	1
and	1
their	1
goods,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
gotten	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
seed	1
with	1
him:	1
46:7	1
His	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
his	1
daughters,	1

his	1

and	1
all	1
his	1

he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
wept	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
a	1
good	1
while.	1
	1
46:30	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Now	1
let	1
me	1
die,	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
face,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
yet	1
alive.	1
	1
46:31	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up,	1
and	1
shew	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
brethren,	1
and	1
my	1
father's	1
house,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
46:32	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
shepherds,	1
for	1
their	1
trade	1
hath	1
been	1
to	1
feed	1
cattle;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have.	1
	1
46:33	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
call	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
occupation?	1
	1
46:34	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thy	1
servants'	1
trade	1
hath	1
been	1
about	1
cattle	1
from	1
our	1
youth	1
even	1
until	1
now,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
fathers:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen;	1
for	1
every	1
shepherd	1
is	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
47:1	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have,	1
are	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
47:2	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
brethren,	1
even	1
five	1
men,	1
and	1
presented	1
them	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:3	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
occupation?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
are	1
shepherds,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
also	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
47:4	1
They	1
said	1
morever	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
For	1
to	1
sojourn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
are	1
we	1
come;	1
for	1
thy	1
servants	1
have	1
no	1
pasture	1
for	1
their	1
flocks;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
is	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
thy	1
servants	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
47:5	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
spake	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
47:6	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
is	1
before	1
thee;	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
make	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
brethren	1
to	1
dwell;	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen	1
let	1
them	1
dwell:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
any	1
men	1
of	1
activity	1
among	1
them,	1
then	1
make	1
them	1
rulers	1
over	1
my	1
cattle.	1
	1
47:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
in	1
Jacob	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Jacob	1
blessed	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:8	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
How	1
old	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
47:9	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
pilgrimage	1
are	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years:	1
few	1
and	1
evil	1
have	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
been,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
attained	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
pilgrimage.	1
	1
47:10	1
And	1
Jacob	1
blessed	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
47:11	1
And	1
Joseph	1
placed	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
possession	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Rameses,	1
as	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
47:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
nourished	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
household,	1
with	1
bread,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
families.	1
	1
47:13	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
for	1
the	1
famine	1
was	1
very	1
sore,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
fainted	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
famine.	1
	1
47:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
gathered	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
which	1
they	1
bought:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
the	1
money	1
into	1
Pharaoh's	1
house.	1
	1
47:15	1
And	1
when	1
money	1
failed	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
came	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
bread:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
die	1
in	1
thy	1
presence?	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
faileth.	1
	1
47:16	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said,	1
Give	1
your	1
cattle;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
cattle,	1
if	1
money	1
fail.	1
	1
47:17	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
their	1
cattle	1
unto	1
Joseph:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
gave	1
them	1
bread	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
horses,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
flocks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
herds,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
he	1
fed	1
them	1
with	1
bread	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
cattle	1
for	1
that	1
year.	1
	1
47:18	1
When	1
that	1
year	1
was	1
ended,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
lord,	1
how	1
that	1
our	1
money	1
is	1
spent;	1
my	1
lord	1
also	1
hath	1
our	1
herds	1
of	1
cattle;	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
ought	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
but	1
our	1
bodies,	1
and	1
our	1
lands:	1
47:19	1
Wherefore	1
shall	1
we	1
die	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
both	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
land?	1
buy	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
land	1
for	1
bread,	1
and	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
land	1
will	1
be	1
servants	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
seed,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die,	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
be	1
not	1
desolate.	1
	1
47:20	1
And	1
Joseph	1
bought	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
Pharaoh;	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
sold	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
field,	1
because	1
the	1
famine	1
prevailed	1
over	1
them:	1
so	1
the	1
land	1
became	1
Pharaoh's.	1
	1
47:21	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
removed	1
them	1
to	1
cities	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
thereof.	1
	1
47:22	1
Only	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
bought	1
he	1
not;	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
had	1
a	1
portion	1
assigned	1
them	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
portion	1
which	1
Pharaoh	1
gave	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
they	1
sold	1
not	1
their	1
lands.	1
	1
47:23	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
you	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
your	1
land	1
for	1
Pharaoh:	1
lo,	1
here	1
is	1
seed	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
47:24	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
increase,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
four	1
parts	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
own,	1
for	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
your	1
households,	1
and	1
for	1
food	1
for	1
your	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
47:25	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
saved	1
our	1
lives:	1
let	1
us	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants.	1
	1
47:26	1
And	1
Joseph	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
law	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
Pharaoh	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
fifth	1
part,	1
except	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
only,	1
which	1
became	1
not	1
Pharaoh's.	1
	1
47:27	1
And	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Goshen;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
possessions	1
therein,	1
and	1
grew,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
47:28	1
And	1
Jacob	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
seventeen	1
years:	1
so	1
the	1
whole	1
age	1
of	1
Jacob	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
47:29	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
nigh	1
that	1
Israel	1
must	1
die:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
son	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
put,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
hand	1
under	1
my	1
thigh,	1
and	1
deal	1
kindly	1
and	1
truly	1
with	1
me;	1
bury	1
me	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
47:30	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
lie	1
with	1
my	1
fathers,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
carry	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bury	1
me	1
in	1
their	1
buryingplace.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
47:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
him.	1
And	1
Israel	1
bowed	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
bed's	1
head.	1
	1
48:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
one	1
told	1
Joseph,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
sick:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
his	1
two	1
sons,	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
48:2	1
And	1
one	1
told	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
son	1
Joseph	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee:	1
and	1
Israel	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
48:3	1
And	1
Jacob	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
God	1
Almighty	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Luz	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
blessed	1
me,	1
48:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people;	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
land	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
possession.	1
	1
48:5	1
And	1
now	1
thy	1
two	1
sons,	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
which	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
unto	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
are	1
mine;	1
as	1
Reuben	1
and	1
Simeon,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
48:6	1
And	1
thy	1
issue,	1
which	1
thou	1
begettest	1
after	1
them,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
in	1
their	1
inheritance.	1
	1
48:7	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
from	1
Padan,	1
Rachel	1
died	1
by	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
Ephrath:	1
and	1
I	1
buried	1
her	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Ephrath;	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
48:8	1
And	1
Israel	1
beheld	1
Joseph's	1
sons,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
are	1
these?	1
	1
48:9	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
They	1
are	1
my	1
sons,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
them,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
them.	1
	1
48:10	1
Now	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
dim	1
for	1
age,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
near	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them.	1
	1
48:11	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
to	1
see	1
thy	1
face:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
also	1
thy	1
seed.	1
	1
48:12	1
And	1
Joseph	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
48:13	1
And	1
Joseph	1
took	1
them	1
both,	1
Ephraim	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
toward	1
Israel's	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
toward	1
Israel's	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
48:14	1
And	1
Israel	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
Ephraim's	1
head,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
younger,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
upon	1
Manasseh's	1
head,	1
guiding	1
his	1
hands	1
wittingly;	1
for	1
Manasseh	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn.	1
	1
48:15	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
said,	1
God,	1
before	1
whom	1
my	1
fathers	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac	1
did	1
walk,	1
the	1
God	1
which	1
fed	1
me	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
long	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
48:16	1
The	1
Angel	1
which	1
redeemed	1
me	1
from	1
all	1
evil,	1
bless	1
the	1
lads;	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
named	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Isaac;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
grow	1
into	1
a	1
multitude	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
48:17	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
it	1
displeased	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
father's	1
hand,	1
to	1
remove	1
it	1
from	1
Ephraim's	1
head	1
unto	1
Manasseh's	1
head.	1
	1
48:18	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Not	1
so,	1
my	1
father:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
firstborn;	1
put	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
48:19	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
refused,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
my	1
son,	1
I	1
know	1
it:	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
great:	1
but	1
truly	1
his	1
younger	1
brother	1
shall	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
nations.	1
	1
48:20	1
And	1
he	1
blessed	1
them	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
Israel	1
bless,	1
saying,	1
God	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
as	1
Manasseh:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
Ephraim	1
before	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
48:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
die:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
48:22	1
Moreover	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
thee	1
one	1
portion	1
above	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Amorite	1
with	1
my	1
sword	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
bow.	1
	1
49:1	1
And	1
Jacob	1
called	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
said,	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
befall	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
49:2	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
hear,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
hearken	1
unto	1
Israel	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
49:3	1
Reuben,	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
firstborn,	1
my	1
might,	1
and	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
my	1
strength,	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
dignity,	1
and	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
power:	1
49:4	1
Unstable	1
as	1
water,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
excel;	1
because	1
thou	1
wentest	1
up	1
to	1
thy	1
father's	1
bed;	1
then	1
defiledst	1
thou	1
it:	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
couch.	1
	1
49:5	1
Simeon	1
and	1
Levi	1
are	1
brethren;	1
instruments	1
of	1
cruelty	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
habitations.	1
	1
49:6	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
come	1
not	1
thou	1
into	1
their	1
secret;	1
unto	1
their	1
assembly,	1
mine	1
honour,	1
be	1
not	1
thou	1
united:	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
anger	1
they	1
slew	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
selfwill	1
they	1
digged	1
down	1
a	1
wall.	1
	1
49:7	1
Cursed	1
be	1
their	1
anger,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
fierce;	1
and	1
their	1
wrath,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cruel:	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
them	1
in	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
scatter	1
them	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
49:8	1
Judah,	1
thou	1
art	1
he	1
whom	1
thy	1
brethren	1
shall	1
praise:	1
thy	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies;	1
thy	1
father's	1
children	1
shall	1
bow	1
down	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
49:9	1
Judah	1
is	1
a	1
lion's	1
whelp:	1
from	1
the	1
prey,	1
my	1
son,	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
up:	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
he	1
couched	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
lion;	1
who	1
shall	1
rouse	1
him	1
up?	1
	1
49:10	1
The	1
sceptre	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Judah,	1
nor	1
a	1
lawgiver	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
feet,	1
until	1
Shiloh	1
come;	1
and	1
unto	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
be.	1
	1
49:11	1
Binding	1
his	1
foal	1
unto	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
his	1
ass's	1
colt	1
unto	1
the	1
choice	1
vine;	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
garments	1
in	1
wine,	1
and	1
his	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
grapes:	1
49:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
red	1
with	1
wine,	1
and	1
his	1
teeth	1
white	1
with	1
milk.	1
	1
49:13	1
Zebulun	1
shall	1
dwell	1
at	1
the	1
haven	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
ships;	1
and	1
his	1
border	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
Zidon.	1
	1
49:14	1
Issachar	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
ass	1
couching	1
down	1
between	1
two	1
burdens:	1
49:15	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
rest	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant;	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
shoulder	1
to	1
bear,	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
servant	1
unto	1
tribute.	1
	1
49:16	1
Dan	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
49:17	1
Dan	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
serpent	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
an	1
adder	1
in	1
the	1
path,	1
that	1
biteth	1
the	1
horse	1
heels,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
rider	1
shall	1
fall	1
backward.	1
	1
49:18	1
I	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
49:19	1
Gad,	1
a	1
troop	1
shall	1
overcome	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
overcome	1
at	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
49:20	1
Out	1
of	1
Asher	1
his	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
fat,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
yield	1
royal	1
dainties.	1
	1
49:21	1
Naphtali	1
is	1
a	1
hind	1
let	1

he	1
giveth	1
goodly	1

	1
49:22	1
Joseph	1
is	1
a	1
fruitful	1
bough,	1
even	1
a	1
fruitful	1
bough	1
by	1
a	1
well;	1
whose	1
branches	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
wall:	1
49:23	1
The	1
archers	1
have	1
sorely	1
grieved	1
him,	1
and	1
shot	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
hated	1
him:	1
49:24	1
But	1
his	1
bow	1
abode	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
made	1
strong	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
(from	1
thence	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
Israel:)	1
49:25	1
Even	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
who	1
shall	1
help	1
thee;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
who	1
shall	1
bless	1
thee	1
with	1
blessings	1
of	1
heaven	1
above,	1
blessings	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
that	1
lieth	1
under,	1
blessings	1
of	1
the	1
breasts,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
womb:	1
49:26	1
The	1
blessings	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
have	1
prevailed	1
above	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
my	1
progenitors	1
unto	1
the	1
utmost	1
bound	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
hills:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
separate	1
from	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
49:27	1
Benjamin	1
shall	1
ravin	1
as	1
a	1
wolf:	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
49:28	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them;	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
blessing	1
he	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
49:29	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
my	1
people:	1
bury	1
me	1
with	1
my	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
49:30	1
In	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Mamre,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace.	1
	1
49:31	1
There	1
they	1
buried	1
Abraham	1
and	1
Sarah	1
his	1
wife;	1
there	1
they	1
buried	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Rebekah	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
buried	1
Leah.	1
	1
49:32	1
The	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
that	1
is	1
therein	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Heth.	1
	1
49:33	1
And	1
when	1
Jacob	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
commanding	1
his	1
sons,	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
and	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
50:1	1
And	1
Joseph	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
father's	1
face,	1
and	1
wept	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
50:2	1
And	1
Joseph	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
physicians	1
to	1
embalm	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
the	1
physicians	1
embalmed	1
Israel.	1
	1
50:3	1
And	1
forty	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled	1
for	1
him;	1
for	1
so	1
are	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
embalmed:	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
mourned	1
for	1
him	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
days.	1
	1
50:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
mourning	1
were	1
past,	1
Joseph	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,	1
speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
50:5	1
My	1
father	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
die:	1
in	1
my	1
grave	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
bury	1
me.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
up,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
50:6	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Go	1
up,	1
and	1
bury	1
thy	1
father,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
thee	1
swear.	1
	1
50:7	1
And	1
Joseph	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
bury	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
went	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
50:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
house:	1
only	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
their	1
flocks,	1
and	1
their	1
herds,	1
they	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen.	1
	1
50:9	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
both	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
company.	1
	1
50:10	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Atad,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
mourned	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
very	1
sore	1
lamentation:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
mourning	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
50:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
saw	1
the	1
mourning	1
in	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
Atad,	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
grievous	1
mourning	1
to	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
wherefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Abelmizraim,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jordan.	1
	1
50:12	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
them:	1
50:13	1
For	1
his	1
sons	1
carried	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Machpelah,	1
which	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
with	1
the	1
field	1
for	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
buryingplace	1
of	1
Ephron	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
before	1
Mamre.	1
	1
50:14	1
And	1
Joseph	1
returned	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
bury	1
his	1
father,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
buried	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
50:15	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph's	1
brethren	1
saw	1
that	1
their	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
said,	1
Joseph	1
will	1
peradventure	1
hate	1
us,	1
and	1
will	1
certainly	1
requite	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
50:16	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
did	1
command	1
before	1
he	1
died,	1
saying,	1
50:17	1
So	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
Joseph,	1
Forgive,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
now,	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
and	1
their	1
sin;	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
thee	1
evil:	1
and	1
now,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
forgive	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father.	1
And	1
Joseph	1
wept	1
when	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
50:18	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
also	1
went	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
be	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
50:19	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
50:20	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
ye	1
thought	1
evil	1
against	1
me;	1
but	1
God	1
meant	1
it	1
unto	1
good,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
save	1
much	1
people	1
alive.	1
	1
50:21	1
Now	1
therefore	1
fear	1
ye	1
not:	1
I	1
will	1
nourish	1
you,	1
and	1
your	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
kindly	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
50:22	1
And	1
Joseph	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
Joseph	1
lived	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
50:23	1
And	1
Joseph	1
saw	1
Ephraim's	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
generation:	1
the	1
children	1
also	1
of	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
upon	1
Joseph's	1
knees.	1
	1
50:24	1
And	1
Joseph	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
I	1
die:	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob.	1
	1
50:25	1
And	1
Joseph	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
carry	1
up	1
my	1
bones	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
50:26	1
So	1
Joseph	1
died,	1
being	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
ten	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
they	1
embalmed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
coffin	1
in	1
Egypt.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
Moses:	1
	1
Called	1
Exodus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
came	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
household	1
came	1
with	1
Jacob.	1
	1
1:2	1
Reuben,	1
Simeon,	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
1:3	1
Issachar,	1
Zebulun,	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
1:4	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Naphtali,	1
Gad,	1
and	1
Asher.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Jacob	1
were	1
seventy	1
souls:	1
for	1
Joseph	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt	1
already.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
Joseph	1
died,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
generation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
increased	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
waxed	1
exceeding	1
mighty;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
there	1
arose	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
king	1
over	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
more	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
we:	1
1:10	1
Come	1
on,	1
let	1
us	1
deal	1
wisely	1
with	1
them;	1
lest	1
they	1
multiply,	1
and	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
there	1
falleth	1
out	1
any	1
war,	1
they	1
join	1
also	1
unto	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
so	1
get	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
1:11	1
Therefore	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
over	1
them	1
taskmasters	1
to	1
afflict	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
burdens.	1
And	1
they	1
built	1
for	1
Pharaoh	1
treasure	1
cities,	1
Pithom	1
and	1
Raamses.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
afflicted	1
them,	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
multiplied	1
and	1
grew.	1
	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
grieved	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
serve	1
with	1
rigour:	1
1:14	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
lives	1
bitter	1
with	1
hard	1
bondage,	1
in	1
morter,	1
and	1
in	1
brick,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
all	1
their	1
service,	1
wherein	1
they	1
made	1
them	1
serve,	1
was	1
with	1
rigour.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
midwives,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Shiphrah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Puah:	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
When	1
ye	1
do	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
midwife	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women,	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
stools;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
kill	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
daughter,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
midwives	1
feared	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
commanded	1
them,	1
but	1
saved	1
the	1
men	1
children	1
alive.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
midwives,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
have	1
saved	1
the	1
men	1
children	1
alive?	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
midwives	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Because	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
lively,	1
and	1
are	1
delivered	1
ere	1
the	1
midwives	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
Therefore	1
God	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
midwives:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
multiplied,	1
and	1
waxed	1
very	1
mighty.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
because	1
the	1
midwives	1
feared	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
houses.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
charged	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Every	1
son	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
every	1
daughter	1
ye	1
shall	1
save	1
alive.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
child,	1
she	1
hid	1
him	1
three	1
months.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
longer	1
hide	1
him,	1
she	1
took	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
bulrushes,	1
and	1
daubed	1
it	1
with	1
slime	1
and	1
with	1
pitch,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
child	1
therein;	1
and	1
she	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
flags	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
brink.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
his	1
sister	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
to	1
wit	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
wash	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
river;	1
and	1
her	1
maidens	1
walked	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
side;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
ark	1
among	1
the	1
flags,	1
she	1
sent	1
her	1
maid	1
to	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
opened	1
it,	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
child:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
babe	1
wept.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews'	1
children.	1
	1
2:7	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
call	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
nurse	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
women,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
nurse	1
the	1
child	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
Go.	1
And	1
the	1
maid	1
went	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
child's	1
mother.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Take	1
this	1
child	1
away,	1
and	1
nurse	1
it	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
thy	1
wages.	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
took	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
nursed	1
it.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
her	1
son.	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Moses:	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
Moses	1
was	1
grown,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
their	1
burdens:	1
and	1
he	1
spied	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
smiting	1
an	1
Hebrew,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man,	1
he	1
slew	1
the	1
Egyptian,	1
and	1
hid	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
strove	1
together:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
wrong,	1
Wherefore	1
smitest	1
thou	1
thy	1
fellow?	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
prince	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
intendest	1
thou	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
killedst	1
the	1
Egyptian?	1
And	1
Moses	1
feared,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
known.	1
	1
2:15	1
Now	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
heard	1
this	1
thing,	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
Moses.	1
But	1
Moses	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
well.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian	1
had	1
seven	1
daughters:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
drew	1
water,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
troughs	1
to	1
water	1
their	1
father's	1
flock.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
came	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
away:	1
but	1
Moses	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
helped	1
them,	1
and	1
watered	1
their	1
flock.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Reuel	1
their	1
father,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
An	1
Egyptian	1
delivered	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
also	1
drew	1
water	1
enough	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
watered	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
daughters,	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
he?	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
man?	1
call	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
man:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
Moses	1
Zipporah	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
she	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Gershom:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
died:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
sighed	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
bondage,	1
and	1
they	1
cried,	1
and	1
their	1
cry	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
God	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
God	1
remembered	1
his	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
with	1
Jacob.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
God	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
God	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Moses	1
kept	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
Jethro	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian:	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
flock	1
to	1
the	1
backside	1
of	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
Horeb.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
bush:	1
and	1
he	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
bush	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
bush	1
was	1
not	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
turn	1
aside,	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
great	1
sight,	1
why	1
the	1
bush	1
is	1
not	1
burnt.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
to	1
see,	1
God	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
bush,	1
and	1
said,	1
Moses,	1
Moses.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Draw	1
not	1
nigh	1
hither:	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
off	1
thy	1
feet,	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
whereon	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
3:6	1
Moreover	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
And	1
Moses	1
hid	1
his	1
face;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
God.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
cry	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
their	1
taskmasters;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
sorrows;	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
unto	1
a	1
good	1
land	1
and	1
a	1
large,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites.	1
	1
3:9	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
seen	1
the	1
oppression	1
wherewith	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
oppress	1
them.	1
	1
3:10	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Who	1
am	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
3:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Certainly	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
token	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
thee:	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
God	1
upon	1
this	1
mountain.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Behold,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
name?	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
AM	1
THAT	1
I	1
AM:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
AM	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
moreover	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
memorial	1
unto	1
all	1
generations.	1
	1
3:16	1
Go,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
visited	1
you,	1
and	1
seen	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
3:17	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
hearken	1
to	1
thy	1
voice:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
met	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
no,	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
smite	1
Egypt	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
wonders	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
this	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
go,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
empty.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
shall	1
borrow	1
of	1
her	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
in	1
her	1
house,	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
your	1
daughters;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
But,	1
behold,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
me,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
voice:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
thine	1
hand?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
A	1
rod.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Cast	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
serpent;	1
and	1
Moses	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Put	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
tail.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
caught	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
rod	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
4:5	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
hath	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
furthermore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
now	1
thine	1
hand	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
bosom:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
out,	1
behold,	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
leprous	1
as	1
snow.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Put	1
thine	1
hand	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom	1
again.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
bosom	1
again;	1
and	1
plucked	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
turned	1
again	1
as	1
his	1
other	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
thee,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
sign,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
believe	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
sign.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
also	1
these	1
two	1
signs,	1
neither	1
hearken	1
unto	1
thy	1
voice,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
which	1
thou	1
takest	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
become	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
O	1
my	1
LORD,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
eloquent,	1
neither	1
heretofore,	1
nor	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
slow	1
of	1
speech,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
slow	1
tongue.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
hath	1
made	1
man's	1
mouth?	1
or	1
who	1
maketh	1
the	1
dumb,	1
or	1
deaf,	1
or	1
the	1
seeing,	1
or	1
the	1
blind?	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
teach	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
LORD,	1
send,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
whom	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
Aaron	1
the	1
Levite	1
thy	1
brother?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
speak	1
well.	1
And	1
also,	1
behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
thee:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
thee,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
spokesman	1
unto	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
thee	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
mouth,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
instead	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
this	1
rod	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
signs.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jethro	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
yet	1
alive.	1
And	1
Jethro	1
said	1
to	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
Midian,	1
Go,	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
are	1
dead	1
which	1
sought	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
see	1
that	1
thou	1
do	1
all	1
those	1
wonders	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
in	1
thine	1
hand:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
his	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Israel	1
is	1
my	1
son,	1
even	1
my	1
firstborn:	1
4:23	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Let	1
my	1
son	1
go,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
serve	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
thy	1
son,	1
even	1
thy	1
firstborn.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
4:25	1
Then	1
Zipporah	1
took	1
a	1
sharp	1
stone,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
foreskin	1
of	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
a	1
bloody	1
husband	1
art	1
thou	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:26	1
So	1
he	1
let	1
him	1
go:	1
then	1
she	1
said,	1
A	1
bloody	1
husband	1
thou	1
art,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
meet	1
Moses.	1
And	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
Aaron	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
who	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
4:30	1
And	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
believed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
visited	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
upon	1
their	1
affliction,	1
then	1
they	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
afterward	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
Pharaoh,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
hold	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
obey	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
let	1
Israel	1
go?	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
let	1
Israel	1
go.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
met	1
with	1
us:	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
pestilence,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wherefore	1
do	1
ye,	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
works?	1
get	1
you	1
unto	1
your	1
burdens.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
now	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
ye	1
make	1
them	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
burdens.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
commanded	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
their	1
officers,	1
saying,	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
give	1
the	1
people	1
straw	1
to	1
make	1
brick,	1
as	1
heretofore:	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
straw	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
the	1
bricks,	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
make	1
heretofore,	1
ye	1
shall	1
lay	1
upon	1
them;	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
diminish	1
ought	1
thereof:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
idle;	1
therefore	1
they	1
cry,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
there	1
more	1
work	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
labour	1
therein;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
regard	1
vain	1
words.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
their	1
officers,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Pharaoh,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
you	1
straw.	1
	1
5:11	1
Go	1
ye,	1
get	1
you	1
straw	1
where	1
ye	1
can	1
find	1
it:	1
yet	1
not	1
ought	1
of	1
your	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
diminished.	1
	1
5:12	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
gather	1
stubble	1
instead	1
of	1
straw.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
taskmasters	1
hasted	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Fulfil	1
your	1
works,	1
your	1
daily	1
tasks,	1
as	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
straw.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
Pharaoh's	1
taskmasters	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
them,	1
were	1
beaten,	1
and	1
demanded,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
fulfilled	1
your	1
task	1
in	1
making	1
brick	1
both	1
yesterday	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
as	1
heretofore?	1
	1
5:15	1
Then	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
dealest	1
thou	1
thus	1
with	1
thy	1
servants?	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
straw	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
to	1
us,	1
Make	1
brick:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
beaten;	1
but	1
the	1
fault	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
people.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
idle,	1
ye	1
are	1
idle:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
say,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
Go	1
therefore	1
now,	1
and	1
work;	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
straw	1
be	1
given	1
you,	1
yet	1
shall	1
ye	1
deliver	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
bricks.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
evil	1
case,	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
minish	1
ought	1
from	1
your	1
bricks	1
of	1
your	1
daily	1
task.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
they	1
met	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
Pharaoh:	1
5:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
look	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
judge;	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
our	1
savour	1
to	1
be	1
abhorred	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
slay	1
us.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
so	1
evil	1
entreated	1
this	1
people?	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me?	1
5:23	1
For	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Pharaoh	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
thy	1
name,	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
evil	1
to	1
this	1
people;	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
delivered	1
thy	1
people	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
6:1	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Now	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
Pharaoh:	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
shall	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
shall	1
he	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:3	1
And	1
I	1
appeared	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
unto	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jacob,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
name	1
JEHOVAH	1
was	1
I	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
established	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
pilgrimage,	1
wherein	1
they	1
were	1
strangers.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
heard	1
the	1
groaning	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
keep	1
in	1
bondage;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
remembered	1
my	1
covenant.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherefore	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
burdens	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rid	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
bondage,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
judgments:	1
6:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
God:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
burdens	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
concerning	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
swear	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
heritage:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
so	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
but	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
Moses	1
for	1
anguish	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
for	1
cruel	1
bondage.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:11	1
Go	1
in,	1
speak	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me;	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
hear	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
of	1
uncircumcised	1
lips?	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
charge	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
6:14	1
These	1
be	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
their	1
fathers'	1
houses:	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben	1
the	1

a	1
Canaanitish	1
woman:	1
these	1

	1
6:16	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
according	1
to	1
their	1

The	1

And	1
the	1

were	1
an	1

	1
6:19	1
And	1

are	1
the	1

	1
6:20	1
And	1
Amram	1
took	1
him	1
Jochebed	1
his	1
father's	1

and	1
she	1

And	1

Aaron's	1

took	1

6:26	1
These	1

Bring	1

the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
land	1

Egypt	1
according	1
to	1

	1
6:27	1
These	1

they	1
which	1
spake	1
to	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
these	1
are	1
that	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
6:29	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
speak	1
thou	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
uncircumcised	1
lips,	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
Pharaoh	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
god	1
to	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
that	1
he	1
send	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
and	1
multiply	1
my	1
signs	1
and	1
my	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:4	1
But	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
lay	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
mine	1
armies,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
great	1
judgments.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
them,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
fourscore	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
old,	1
when	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
7:9	1
When	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
saying,	1
Shew	1
a	1
miracle	1
for	1
you:	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
serpent.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
rod	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
serpent.	1
	1
7:11	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
also	1
called	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
sorcerers:	1
now	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
they	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments.	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
they	1
cast	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
rod,	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
serpents:	1
but	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
swallowed	1
up	1
their	1
rods.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
he	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
is	1
hardened,	1
he	1
refuseth	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
7:15	1
Get	1
thee	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
lo,	1
he	1
goeth	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
river's	1
brink	1
against	1
he	1
come;	1
and	1
the	1
rod	1
which	1
was	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
serpent	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
hitherto	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
7:17	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
In	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
blood.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
die,	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
stink;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
lothe	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
their	1
streams,	1
upon	1
their	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
ponds,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
their	1
pools	1
of	1
water,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
become	1
blood;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
blood	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded;	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
were	1
turned	1
to	1
blood.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
stank,	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
blood	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
of	1
Egypt	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments:	1
and	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
this	1
also.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
digged	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
river	1
for	1
water	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
thy	1
borders	1
with	1
frogs:	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
frogs	1
abundantly,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
bedchamber,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
into	1
thine	1
ovens,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
kneadingtroughs:	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
frogs	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
both	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
with	1
thy	1
rod	1
over	1
the	1
streams,	1
over	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
ponds,	1
and	1
cause	1
frogs	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
Aaron	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
the	1
frogs	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
frogs	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:8	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said,	1
Intreat	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
frogs	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
from	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Glory	1
over	1
me:	1
when	1
shall	1
I	1
intreat	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
people,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
frogs	1
from	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
houses,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
only?	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Be	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
frogs	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
houses,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
people;	1
they	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
only.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
frogs	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
against	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
the	1
frogs	1
died	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fields.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
upon	1
heaps:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
stank.	1
	1
8:15	1
But	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
respite,	1
he	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
become	1
lice	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so;	1
for	1
Aaron	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
rod,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
lice	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
in	1
beast;	1
all	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
became	1
lice	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
their	1
enchantments	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
lice,	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not:	1
so	1
there	1
were	1
lice	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
the	1
magicians	1
said	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened,	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
Pharaoh;	1
lo,	1
he	1
cometh	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
8:21	1
Else,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
into	1
thy	1
houses:	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
ground	1
whereon	1
they	1
are.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sever	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
people	1
dwell,	1
that	1
no	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
shall	1
be	1
there;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
division	1
between	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
thy	1
people:	1
to	1
morrow	1
shall	1
this	1
sign	1
be.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
so;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
grievous	1
swarm	1
of	1
flies	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
into	1
his	1
servants'	1
houses,	1
and	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
corrupted	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
swarm	1
of	1
flies.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
for	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
so	1
to	1
do;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
lo,	1
shall	1
we	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
before	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
stone	1
us?	1
	1
8:27	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
three	1
days'	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
command	1
us.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
only	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
very	1
far	1
away:	1
intreat	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
may	1
depart	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
from	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
morrow:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
Pharaoh	1
deal	1
deceitfully	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
not	1
letting	1
the	1
people	1
go	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
he	1
removed	1
the	1
swarms	1
of	1
flies	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
from	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
people;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
also,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
tell	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
and	1
wilt	1
hold	1
them	1
still,	1
9:3	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
thy	1
cattle	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
upon	1
the	1
horses,	1
upon	1
the	1
asses,	1
upon	1
the	1
camels,	1
upon	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
sheep:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
murrain.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
sever	1
between	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
nothing	1
die	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
children's	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appointed	1
a	1
set	1
time,	1
saying,	1
To	1
morrow	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
that	1
thing	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
Egypt	1
died:	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
died	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
sent,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cattle	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
dead.	1
And	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
hardened,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
to	1
you	1
handfuls	1
of	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
and	1
let	1
Moses	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
toward	1
the	1
heaven	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
become	1
small	1
dust	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
boil	1
breaking	1
forth	1
with	1
blains	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
furnace,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
Pharaoh;	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
up	1
toward	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
boil	1
breaking	1
forth	1
with	1
blains	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
magicians	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
before	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
boils;	1
for	1
the	1
boil	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
magicians,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
stand	1
before	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
Let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
send	1
all	1
my	1
plagues	1
upon	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
people;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
smite	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
pestilence;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
in	1
very	1
deed	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
in	1
thee	1
my	1
power;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:17	1
As	1
yet	1
exaltest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
against	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
go?	1
	1
9:18	1
Behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
a	1
very	1
grievous	1
hail,	1
such	1
as	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
Egypt	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
9:19	1
Send	1
therefore	1
now,	1
and	1
gather	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
for	1
upon	1
every	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
home,	1
the	1
hail	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
9:20	1
He	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
made	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
his	1
cattle	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
houses:	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
regarded	1
not	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
left	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
his	1
cattle	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
hail	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
upon	1
man,	1
and	1
upon	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
throughout	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
rod	1
toward	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thunder	1
and	1
hail,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
ran	1
along	1
upon	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
rained	1
hail	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:24	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
hail,	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
hail,	1
very	1
grievous,	1
such	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
since	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
nation.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
the	1
hail	1
smote	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
smote	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brake	1
every	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
9:26	1
Only	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Goshen,	1
where	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were,	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
hail.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
sent,	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
this	1
time:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous,	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
wicked.	1
	1
9:28	1
Intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
enough)	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
mighty	1
thunderings	1
and	1
hail;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
stay	1
no	1
longer.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
abroad	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
thunder	1
shall	1
cease,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
hail;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
9:30	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
yet	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
the	1
flax	1
and	1
the	1
barley	1
was	1
smitten:	1
for	1
the	1
barley	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
the	1
flax	1
was	1
bolled.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
the	1
rie	1
were	1
not	1
smitten:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
spread	1
abroad	1
his	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
and	1
hail	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
not	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
rain	1
and	1
the	1
hail	1
and	1
the	1
thunders	1
were	1
ceased,	1
he	1
sinned	1
yet	1
more,	1
and	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
was	1
hardened,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
these	1
my	1
signs	1
before	1
him:	1
10:2	1
And	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
tell	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
son's	1
son,	1
what	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
wrought	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
my	1
signs	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
among	1
them;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
humble	1
thyself	1
before	1
me?	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
10:4	1
Else,	1
if	1
thou	1
refuse	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
people	1
go,	1
behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
locusts	1
into	1
thy	1
coast:	1
10:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
escaped,	1
which	1
remaineth	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
hail,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
every	1
tree	1
which	1
groweth	1
for	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
10:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fill	1
thy	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
which	1
neither	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
thy	1
fathers'	1
fathers	1
have	1
seen,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
us?	1
let	1
the	1
men	1
go,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God:	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
yet	1
that	1
Egypt	1
is	1
destroyed?	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
were	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
go?	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
our	1
young	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
old,	1
with	1
our	1
sons	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
daughters,	1
with	1
our	1
flocks	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
herds	1
will	1
we	1
go;	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
hold	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
and	1
your	1
little	1
ones:	1
look	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
evil	1
is	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
10:11	1
Not	1
so:	1
go	1
now	1
ye	1
that	1
are	1
men,	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
desire.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
driven	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh's	1
presence.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
the	1
locusts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
eat	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
hail	1
hath	1
left.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
rod	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
morning,	1
the	1
east	1
wind	1
brought	1
the	1
locusts.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
the	1
locust	1
went	1
up	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
rested	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
very	1
grievous	1
were	1
they;	1
before	1
them	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
such	1
locusts	1
as	1
they,	1
neither	1
after	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
such.	1
	1
10:15	1
For	1
they	1
covered	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
darkened;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
every	1
herb	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
which	1
the	1
hail	1
had	1
left:	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
any	1
green	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
trees,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
herbs	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:16	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
haste;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
therefore	1
forgive,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
my	1
sin	1
only	1
this	1
once,	1
and	1
intreat	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
this	1
death	1
only.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
a	1
mighty	1
strong	1
west	1
wind,	1
which	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
locusts,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
Red	1
sea;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
one	1
locust	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
darkness	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
darkness	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
felt.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
heaven;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
thick	1
darkness	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
three	1
days:	1
10:23	1
They	1
saw	1
not	1
one	1
another,	1
neither	1
rose	1
any	1
from	1
his	1
place	1
for	1
three	1
days:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
light	1
in	1
their	1
dwellings.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD;	1
only	1
let	1
your	1
flocks	1
and	1
your	1
herds	1
be	1
stayed:	1
let	1
your	1
little	1
ones	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thou	1
must	1
give	1
us	1
also	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
10:26	1
Our	1
cattle	1
also	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
us;	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hoof	1
be	1
left	1
behind;	1
for	1
thereof	1
must	1
we	1
take	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
thither.	1
	1
10:27	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
from	1
me,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself,	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more;	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
thou	1
seest	1
my	1
face	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
well,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
thy	1
face	1
again	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
one	1
plague	1
more	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
Egypt;	1
afterwards	1
he	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
hence:	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
you	1
go,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
thrust	1
you	1
out	1
hence	1
altogether.	1
	1
11:2	1
Speak	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
borrow	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
woman	1
of	1
her	1
neighbour,	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
the	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
Moreover	1
the	1
man	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
servants,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
About	1
midnight	1
will	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
11:5	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
die,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
born	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
maidservant	1
that	1
is	1
behind	1
the	1
mill;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
beasts.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
such	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
it,	1
nor	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
it	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
11:7	1
But	1
against	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
a	1
dog	1
move	1
his	1
tongue,	1
against	1
man	1
or	1
beast:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
put	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
all	1
these	1
thy	1
servants	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
themselves	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
thee:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Pharaoh	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
anger.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Pharaoh	1
shall	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you;	1
that	1
my	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
multiplied	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
did	1
all	1
these	1
wonders	1
before	1
Pharaoh:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
saying,	1
12:2	1
This	1
month	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
months:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
12:3	1
Speak	1
ye	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
month	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
to	1
them	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
lamb,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
a	1
lamb	1
for	1
an	1
house:	1
12:4	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
household	1
be	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
lamb,	1
let	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
neighbour	1
next	1
unto	1
his	1
house	1
take	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
souls;	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating	1
shall	1
make	1
your	1
count	1
for	1
the	1
lamb.	1
	1
12:5	1
Your	1
lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
without	1
blemish,	1
a	1
male	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year:	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
sheep,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
goats:	1
12:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
up	1
until	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
kill	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
strike	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
door	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
houses,	1
wherein	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
that	1
night,	1
roast	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
and	1
with	1
bitter	1
herbs	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
12:9	1
Eat	1
not	1
of	1
it	1
raw,	1
nor	1
sodden	1
at	1
all	1
with	1
water,	1
but	1
roast	1
with	1
fire;	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
purtenance	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
let	1
nothing	1
of	1
it	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
ye	1
shall	1
burn	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
it;	1
with	1
your	1
loins	1
girded,	1
your	1
shoes	1
on	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
your	1
staff	1
in	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
haste:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
passover.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
judgment:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
the	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
upon	1
the	1
houses	1
where	1
ye	1
are:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
blood,	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
you	1
to	1
destroy	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
smite	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
this	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
memorial;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations;	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
feast	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:15	1
Seven	1
days	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
even	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
leaven	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
houses:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
leavened	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation	1
to	1
you;	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
them,	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
man	1
must	1
eat,	1
that	1
only	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
selfsame	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
your	1
armies	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
your	1
generations	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:18	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even,	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
until	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
12:19	1
Seven	1
days	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
leaven	1
found	1
in	1
your	1
houses:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
leavened,	1
even	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
12:20	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
nothing	1
leavened;	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
habitations	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread.	1
	1
12:21	1
Then	1
Moses	1
called	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Draw	1
out	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
a	1
lamb	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
families,	1
and	1
kill	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
dip	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bason,	1
and	1
strike	1
the	1
lintel	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bason;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
12:23	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
lintel,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
side	1
posts,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
destroyer	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
your	1
houses	1
to	1
smite	1
you.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
this	1
thing	1
for	1
an	1
ordinance	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
you,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
this	1
service.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
by	1
this	1
service?	1
	1
12:27	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
passover,	1
who	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
when	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
delivered	1
our	1
houses.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
bowed	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
midnight	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
throne	1
unto	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
captive	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dungeon;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
cattle.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
Pharaoh	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
in	1
Egypt;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
dead.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
forth	1
from	1
among	1
my	1
people,	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
go,	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
said.	1
	1
12:32	1
Also	1
take	1
your	1
flocks	1
and	1
your	1
herds,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
be	1
gone;	1
and	1
bless	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
12:33	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
were	1
urgent	1
upon	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
send	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
haste;	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
be	1
all	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
their	1
dough	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
leavened,	1
their	1
kneadingtroughs	1
being	1
bound	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
clothes	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses;	1
and	1
they	1
borrowed	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
jewels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment:	1
12:36	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
the	1
people	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
lent	1
unto	1
them	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
required.	1
And	1
they	1
spoiled	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
12:37	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Rameses	1
to	1
Succoth,	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
on	1
foot	1
that	1
were	1
men,	1
beside	1
children.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
a	1
mixed	1
multitude	1
went	1
up	1
also	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
flocks,	1
and	1
herds,	1
even	1
very	1
much	1
cattle.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
they	1
baked	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
of	1
the	1
dough	1
which	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
leavened;	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
thrust	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
tarry,	1
neither	1
had	1
they	1
prepared	1
for	1
themselves	1
any	1
victual.	1
	1
12:40	1
Now	1
the	1
sojourning	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years.	1
	1
12:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years,	1
even	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:42	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
night	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
observed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
bringing	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
12:43	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
passover:	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
12:44	1
But	1
every	1
man's	1
servant	1
that	1
is	1
bought	1
for	1
money,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
circumcised	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:45	1
A	1
foreigner	1
and	1
an	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:46	1
In	1
one	1
house	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
carry	1
forth	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
abroad	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
break	1
a	1
bone	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:47	1
All	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
12:48	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
sojourn	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
let	1
all	1
his	1
males	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
then	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
near	1
and	1
keep	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
no	1
uncircumcised	1
person	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
12:49	1
One	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
homeborn,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
12:50	1
Thus	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
12:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
selfsame	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
bring	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
their	1
armies.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
Sanctify	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
whatsoever	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
of	1
beast:	1
it	1
is	1
mine.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Remember	1
this	1
day,	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage;	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
place:	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
13:4	1
This	1
day	1
came	1
ye	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Abib.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers	1
to	1
give	1
thee,	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
this	1
service	1
in	1
this	1
month.	1
	1
13:6	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:7	1
Unleavened	1
bread	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
leavened	1
bread	1
be	1
seen	1
with	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
leaven	1
seen	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
quarters.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shew	1
thy	1
son	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
done	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
unto	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
between	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD's	1
law	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth:	1
for	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:10	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
therefore	1
keep	1
this	1
ordinance	1
in	1
his	1
season	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
as	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
thee,	1
13:12	1
That	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
apart	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix,	1
and	1
every	1
firstling	1
that	1
cometh	1
of	1
a	1
beast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast;	1
the	1
males	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
every	1
firstling	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem	1
with	1
a	1
lamb;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
break	1
his	1
neck:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man	1
among	1
thy	1
children	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
when	1
thy	1
son	1
asketh	1
thee	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
this?	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
By	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage:	1
13:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
would	1
hardly	1
let	1
us	1
go,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
both	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
beast:	1
therefore	1
I	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix,	1
being	1
males;	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
my	1
children	1
I	1
redeem.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
upon	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
for	1
frontlets	1
between	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
of	1
hand	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
had	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
that	1
God	1
led	1
them	1
not	1
through	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
although	1
that	1
was	1
near;	1
for	1
God	1
said,	1
Lest	1
peradventure	1
the	1
people	1
repent	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
war,	1
and	1
they	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt:	1
13:18	1
But	1
God	1
led	1
the	1
people	1
about,	1
through	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
harnessed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Joseph	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
straitly	1
sworn	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
God	1
will	1
surely	1
visit	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
carry	1
up	1
my	1
bones	1
away	1
hence	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
from	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Etham,	1
in	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
before	1
them	1
by	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
a	1
cloud,	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
the	1
way;	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
light;	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
night:	1
13:22	1
He	1
took	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
by	1
day,	1
nor	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night,	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
14:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
turn	1
and	1
encamp	1
before	1
Pihahiroth,	1
between	1
Migdol	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
over	1
against	1
Baalzephon:	1
before	1
it	1
shall	1
ye	1
encamp	1
by	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Pharaoh	1
will	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
They	1
are	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
wilderness	1
hath	1
shut	1
them	1
in.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
Pharaoh's	1
heart,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
follow	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
honoured	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
host;	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
fled:	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
was	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Why	1
have	1
we	1
done	1
this,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
let	1
Israel	1
go	1
from	1
serving	1
us?	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
ready	1
his	1
chariot,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
him:	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
six	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
chariots,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hardened	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
hand.	1
	1
14:9	1
But	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
pursued	1
after	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
his	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
his	1
army,	1
and	1
overtook	1
them	1
encamping	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
beside	1
Pihahiroth,	1
before	1
Baalzephon.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
when	1
Pharaoh	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
marched	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
graves	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
hast	1
thou	1
taken	1
us	1
away	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
dealt	1
thus	1
with	1
us,	1
to	1
carry	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
	1
14:12	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
we	1
did	1
tell	1
thee	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
the	1
Egyptians?	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
than	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not,	1
stand	1
still,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
to	1
day,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
14:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
fight	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
hold	1
your	1
peace.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Wherefore	1
criest	1
thou	1
unto	1
me?	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
forward:	1
14:16	1
But	1
lift	1
thou	1
up	1
thy	1
rod,	1
and	1
stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
divide	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
go	1
on	1
dry	1
ground	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
harden	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
follow	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
me	1
honour	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
upon	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
gotten	1
me	1
honour	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
upon	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel,	1
removed	1
and	1
went	1
behind	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
went	1
from	1
before	1
their	1
face,	1
and	1
stood	1
behind	1
them:	1
14:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
between	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
darkness	1
to	1
them,	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
light	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
these:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
came	1
not	1
near	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
caused	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
east	1
wind	1
all	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
divided.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
left.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
pursued,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
after	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
even	1
all	1
Pharaoh's	1
horses,	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
watch	1
the	1
LORD	1
looked	1
unto	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
through	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
14:25	1
And	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
chariot	1
wheels,	1
that	1
they	1
drave	1
them	1
heavily:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
fighteth	1
for	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Stretch	1
out	1
thine	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
the	1
waters	1
may	1
come	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
upon	1
their	1
chariots,	1
and	1
upon	1
their	1
horsemen.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
strength	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
appeared;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
fled	1
against	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
overthrew	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
the	1
waters	1
returned,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
after	1
them;	1
there	1
remained	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:29	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
walked	1
upon	1
dry	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
left.	1
	1
14:30	1
Thus	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
Israel	1
that	1
day	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians;	1
and	1
Israel	1
saw	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
dead	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
shore.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
great	1
work	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
servant	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
sang	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
this	1
song	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
triumphed	1
gloriously:	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
hath	1
he	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
song,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
salvation:	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
prepare	1
him	1
an	1
habitation;	1
my	1
father's	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
exalt	1
him.	1
	1
15:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war:	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:4	1
Pharaoh's	1
chariots	1
and	1
his	1
host	1
hath	1
he	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
his	1
chosen	1
captains	1
also	1
are	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
15:5	1
The	1
depths	1
have	1
covered	1
them:	1
they	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
bottom	1
as	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
15:6	1
Thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
is	1
become	1
glorious	1
in	1
power:	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hath	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
excellency	1
thou	1
hast	1
overthrown	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
thee:	1
thou	1
sentest	1
forth	1
thy	1
wrath,	1
which	1
consumed	1
them	1
as	1
stubble.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
thy	1
nostrils	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
the	1
floods	1
stood	1
upright	1
as	1
an	1
heap,	1
and	1
the	1
depths	1
were	1
congealed	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:9	1
The	1
enemy	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
pursue,	1
I	1
will	1
overtake,	1
I	1
will	1
divide	1
the	1
spoil;	1
my	1
lust	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
draw	1
my	1
sword,	1
my	1
hand	1
shall	1
destroy	1
them.	1
	1
15:10	1
Thou	1
didst	1
blow	1
with	1
thy	1
wind,	1
the	1
sea	1
covered	1
them:	1
they	1
sank	1
as	1
lead	1
in	1
the	1
mighty	1
waters.	1
	1
15:11	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
among	1
the	1
gods?	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
thee,	1
glorious	1
in	1
holiness,	1
fearful	1
in	1
praises,	1
doing	1
wonders?	1
	1
15:12	1
Thou	1
stretchedst	1
out	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
the	1
earth	1
swallowed	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
Thou	1
in	1
thy	1
mercy	1
hast	1
led	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed:	1
thou	1
hast	1
guided	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
strength	1
unto	1
thy	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
15:14	1
The	1
people	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
be	1
afraid:	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Palestina.	1
	1
15:15	1
Then	1
the	1
dukes	1
of	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
amazed;	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
Moab,	1
trembling	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
upon	1
them;	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Canaan	1
shall	1
melt	1
away.	1
	1
15:16	1
Fear	1
and	1
dread	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
them;	1
by	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thine	1
arm	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
stone;	1
till	1
thy	1
people	1
pass	1
over,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
till	1
the	1
people	1
pass	1
over,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
purchased.	1
	1
15:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
plant	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
in,	1
in	1
the	1
Sanctuary,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
which	1
thy	1
hands	1
have	1
established.	1
	1
15:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:19	1
For	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
chariots	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
horsemen	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
upon	1
them;	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
on	1
dry	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
Miriam	1
the	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
took	1
a	1
timbrel	1
in	1
her	1
hand;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
her	1
with	1
timbrels	1
and	1
with	1
dances.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
Miriam	1
answered	1
them,	1
Sing	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
triumphed	1
gloriously;	1
the	1
horse	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
hath	1
he	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
15:22	1
So	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Shur;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
found	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Marah,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Marah,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
bitter:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
Marah.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink?	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
him	1
a	1
tree,	1
which	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
waters,	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
made	1
sweet:	1
there	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
statute	1
and	1
an	1
ordinance,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
proved	1
them,	1
15:26	1
And	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
diligently	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
wilt	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
wilt	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
his	1
statutes,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
diseases	1
upon	1
thee,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
upon	1
the	1
Egyptians:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
healeth	1
thee.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Elim,	1
where	1
were	1
twelve	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
palm	1
trees:	1
and	1
they	1
encamped	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
from	1
Elim,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sin,	1
which	1
is	1
between	1
Elim	1
and	1
Sinai,	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
after	1
their	1
departing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
when	1
we	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
flesh	1
pots,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
into	1
this	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
kill	1
this	1
whole	1
assembly	1
with	1
hunger.	1
	1
16:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
rain	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
for	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
gather	1
a	1
certain	1
rate	1
every	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
prove	1
them,	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
or	1
no.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
prepare	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
in;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
gather	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
At	1
even,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
16:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
your	1
murmurings	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we,	1
that	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full;	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
heareth	1
your	1
murmurings	1
which	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we?	1
your	1
murmurings	1
are	1
not	1
against	1
us,	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Say	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Come	1
near	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
heard	1
your	1
murmurings.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
speak	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
At	1
even	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
bread;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
even	1
the	1
quails	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
camp:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
dew	1
lay	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dew	1
that	1
lay	1
was	1
gone	1
up,	1
behold,	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
there	1
lay	1
a	1
small	1
round	1
thing,	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
the	1
hoar	1
frost	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
It	1
is	1
manna:	1
for	1
they	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
16:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
Gather	1
of	1
it	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating,	1
an	1
omer	1
for	1
every	1
man,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
persons;	1
take	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
tents.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
gathered,	1
some	1
more,	1
some	1
less.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
did	1
mete	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
omer,	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack;	1
they	1
gathered	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
leave	1
of	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
16:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
Moses;	1
but	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
left	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
it	1
bred	1
worms,	1
and	1
stank:	1
and	1
Moses	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
it	1
every	1
morning,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
eating:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
waxed	1
hot,	1
it	1
melted.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
they	1
gathered	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
bread,	1
two	1
omers	1
for	1
one	1
man:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
Moses.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
bake	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
will	1
bake	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
seethe	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
seethe;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
over	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
till	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
Moses	1
bade:	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
stink,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
worm	1
therein.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Eat	1
that	1
to	1
day;	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
to	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
16:26	1
Six	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
gather	1
it;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
for	1
to	1
gather,	1
and	1
they	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
How	1
long	1
refuse	1
ye	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
laws?	1
	1
16:29	1
See,	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
therefore	1
he	1
giveth	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
sixth	1
day	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
two	1
days;	1
abide	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day.	1
	1
16:30	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Manna:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
coriander	1
seed,	1
white;	1
and	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
wafers	1
made	1
with	1
honey.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commandeth,	1
Fill	1
an	1
omer	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
your	1
generations;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
bread	1
wherewith	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
when	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
a	1
pot,	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
omer	1
full	1
of	1
manna	1
therein,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
16:34	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
Aaron	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
Testimony,	1
to	1
be	1
kept.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
forty	1
years,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
inhabited;	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
manna,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
16:36	1
Now	1
an	1
omer	1
is	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sin,	1
after	1
their	1
journeys,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Rephidim:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
17:2	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
chide	1
with	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
water	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
drink.	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
chide	1
ye	1
with	1
me?	1
wherefore	1
do	1
ye	1
tempt	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
thirsted	1
there	1
for	1
water;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
kill	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
and	1
our	1
cattle	1
with	1
thirst?	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
this	1
people?	1
they	1
be	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
stone	1
me.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
thy	1
rod,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
smotest	1
the	1
river,	1
take	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
go.	1
	1
17:6	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
before	1
thee	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
in	1
Horeb;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
drink.	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Massah,	1
and	1
Meribah,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
chiding	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
tempted	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
us,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
17:8	1
Then	1
came	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Israel	1
in	1
Rephidim.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
Choose	1
us	1
out	1
men,	1
and	1
go	1
out,	1
fight	1
with	1
Amalek:	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
Joshua	1
did	1
as	1
Moses	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Amalek:	1
and	1
Moses,	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
Hur	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
Israel	1
prevailed:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
let	1
down	1
his	1
hand,	1
Amalek	1
prevailed.	1
	1
17:12	1
But	1
Moses	1
hands	1
were	1
heavy;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Hur	1
stayed	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
steady	1
until	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
Joshua	1
discomfited	1
Amalek	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Write	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
rehearse	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Joshua:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
Amalek	1
from	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
built	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Jehovahnissi:	1
17:16	1
For	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
have	1
war	1
with	1
Amalek	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jethro,	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
for	1
Israel	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
brought	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
18:2	1
Then	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
took	1
Zipporah,	1
Moses'	1
wife,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
back,	1
18:3	1
And	1
her	1
two	1
sons;	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Gershom;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
alien	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land:	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
Eliezer;	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
said	1
he,	1
was	1
mine	1
help,	1
and	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Pharaoh:	1
18:5	1
And	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
Moses	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
he	1
encamped	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God:	1
18:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
thy	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
Jethro	1
am	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
sons	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
welfare;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
for	1
Israel's	1
sake,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
travail	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
Jethro	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
Jethro	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians.	1
	1
18:11	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
gods:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
thing	1
wherein	1
they	1
dealt	1
proudly	1
he	1
was	1
above	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
Jethro,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
took	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
God:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Moses	1
sat	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
by	1
Moses	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
unto	1
the	1
evening.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
people?	1
why	1
sittest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
alone,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stand	1
by	1
thee	1
from	1
morning	1
unto	1
even?	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
Because	1
the	1
people	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God:	1
18:16	1
When	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
matter,	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
judge	1
between	1
one	1
and	1
another,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
make	1
them	1
know	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
laws.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
	1
18:18	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
surely	1
wear	1
away,	1
both	1
thou,	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
for	1
thee;	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
perform	1
it	1
thyself	1
alone.	1
	1
18:19	1
Hearken	1
now	1
unto	1
my	1
voice,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
counsel,	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee:	1
Be	1
thou	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
God-ward,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
the	1
causes	1
unto	1
God:	1
18:20	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
teach	1
them	1
ordinances	1
and	1
laws,	1
and	1
shalt	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
they	1
must	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
18:21	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
provide	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
able	1
men,	1
such	1
as	1
fear	1
God,	1
men	1
of	1
truth,	1
hating	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
place	1
such	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
be	1
rulers	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
rulers	1
of	1
fifties,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
tens:	1
18:22	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
judge	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
all	1
seasons:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
every	1
great	1
matter	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
every	1
small	1
matter	1
they	1
shall	1
judge:	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
thyself,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
18:23	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
God	1
command	1
thee	1
so,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
shall	1
also	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
place	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
18:24	1
So	1
Moses	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
chose	1
able	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
heads	1
over	1
the	1
people,	1
rulers	1
of	1
thousands,	1
rulers	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
rulers	1
of	1
fifties,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
tens.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
judged	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
all	1
seasons:	1
the	1
hard	1
causes	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
but	1
every	1
small	1
matter	1
they	1
judged	1
themselves.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
let	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
depart;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
19:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
month,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gone	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
came	1
they	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai.	1
	1
19:2	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
departed	1
from	1
Rephidim,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
had	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
there	1
Israel	1
camped	1
before	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
19:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
unto	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
bare	1
you	1
on	1
eagles'	1
wings,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
unto	1
myself.	1
	1
19:5	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
obey	1
my	1
voice	1
indeed,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
covenant,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
peculiar	1
treasure	1
unto	1
me	1
above	1
all	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
mine:	1
19:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
kingdom	1
of	1
priests,	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
nation.	1
	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
came	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
before	1
their	1
faces	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
together,	1
and	1
said,	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
we	1
will	1
do.	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
hear	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
believe	1
thee	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
them	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
wash	1
their	1
clothes,	1
19:11	1
And	1
be	1
ready	1
against	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
bounds	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
go	1
not	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
or	1
touch	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
it:	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
mount	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
19:13	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hand	1
touch	1
it,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
shot	1
through;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
beast	1
or	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
live:	1
when	1
the	1
trumpet	1
soundeth	1
long,	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
clothes.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Be	1
ready	1
against	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
come	1
not	1
at	1
your	1
wives.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
thunders	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
a	1
thick	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
exceeding	1
loud;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
trembled.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
God;	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
nether	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
was	1
altogether	1
on	1
a	1
smoke,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
descended	1
upon	1
it	1
in	1
fire:	1
and	1
the	1
smoke	1
thereof	1
ascended	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
furnace,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
mount	1
quaked	1
greatly.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
sounded	1
long,	1
and	1
waxed	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
Moses	1
spake,	1
and	1
God	1
answered	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
voice.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Moses	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount;	1
and	1
Moses	1
went	1
up.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go	1
down,	1
charge	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
break	1
through	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
gaze,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
perish.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
priests	1
also,	1
which	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
sanctify	1
themselves,	1
lest	1
the	1
LORD	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
The	1
people	1
cannot	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Sinai:	1
for	1
thou	1
chargedst	1
us,	1
saying,	1
Set	1
bounds	1
about	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Away,	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
up,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
with	1
thee:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
break	1
through	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
lest	1
he	1
break	1
forth	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
19:25	1
So	1
Moses	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
saying,	1
20:2	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
20:3	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
gods	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
20:4	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
unto	1
thee	1
any	1
graven	1
image,	1
or	1
any	1
likeness	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
under	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
20:5	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
thyself	1
to	1
them,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
am	1
a	1
jealous	1
God,	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generation	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me;	1
20:6	1
And	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
unto	1
thousands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
me,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
20:7	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
vain;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
him	1
guiltless	1
that	1
taketh	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
20:8	1
Remember	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
holy.	1
	1
20:9	1
Six	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
labour,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
thy	1
work:	1
20:10	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
in	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
do	1
any	1
work,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
son,	1
nor	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
thy	1
manservant,	1
nor	1
thy	1
maidservant,	1
nor	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
nor	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
thy	1
gates:	1
20:11	1
For	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is,	1
and	1
rested	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
hallowed	1
it.	1
	1
20:12	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother:	1
that	1
thy	1
days	1
may	1
be	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
giveth	1
thee.	1
	1
20:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill.	1
	1
20:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
20:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal.	1
	1
20:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
thy	1
neighbour.	1
	1
20:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
house,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
nor	1
his	1
manservant,	1
nor	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
nor	1
his	1
ox,	1
nor	1
his	1
ass,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
thy	1
neighbour's.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
the	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
the	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
smoking:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
stood	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
thou	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
hear:	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
God	1
speak	1
with	1
us,	1
lest	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
prove	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
fear	1
may	1
be	1
before	1
your	1
faces,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
Moses	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
thick	1
darkness	1
where	1
God	1
was.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Thus	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
talked	1
with	1
you	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
20:23	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
with	1
me	1
gods	1
of	1
silver,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
unto	1
you	1
gods	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
20:24	1
An	1
altar	1
of	1
earth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
shalt	1
sacrifice	1
thereon	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
thy	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
thy	1
sheep,	1
and	1
thine	1
oxen:	1
in	1
all	1
places	1
where	1
I	1
record	1
my	1
name	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
me	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
stone,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
it	1
of	1
hewn	1
stone:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
tool	1
upon	1
it,	1
thou	1
hast	1
polluted	1
it.	1
	1
20:26	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
by	1
steps	1
unto	1
mine	1
altar,	1
that	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
be	1
not	1
discovered	1
thereon.	1
	1
21:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
judgments	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
21:2	1
If	1
thou	1
buy	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
servant,	1
six	1
years	1
he	1
shall	1
serve:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
free	1
for	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:3	1
If	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
himself,	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
himself:	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
married,	1
then	1
his	1
wife	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:4	1
If	1
his	1
master	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
have	1
born	1
him	1
sons	1
or	1
daughters;	1
the	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
children	1
shall	1
be	1
her	1
master's,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
by	1
himself.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
servant	1
shall	1
plainly	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
my	1
master,	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
my	1
children;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
free:	1
21:6	1
Then	1
his	1
master	1
shall	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
judges;	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
or	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
post;	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
shall	1
bore	1
his	1
ear	1
through	1
with	1
an	1
aul;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
serve	1
him	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sell	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
maidservant,	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
menservants	1
do.	1
	1
21:8	1
If	1
she	1
please	1
not	1
her	1
master,	1
who	1
hath	1
betrothed	1
her	1
to	1
himself,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
redeemed:	1
to	1
sell	1
her	1
unto	1
a	1
strange	1
nation	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power,	1
seeing	1
he	1
hath	1
dealt	1
deceitfully	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
betrothed	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
shall	1
deal	1
with	1
her	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
daughters.	1
	1
21:10	1
If	1
he	1
take	1
him	1
another	1
wife;	1
her	1
food,	1
her	1
raiment,	1
and	1
her	1
duty	1
of	1
marriage,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
diminish.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
do	1
not	1
these	1
three	1
unto	1
her,	1
then	1
shall	1
she	1
go	1
out	1
free	1
without	1
money.	1
	1
21:12	1
He	1
that	1
smiteth	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
die,	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
not	1
in	1
wait,	1
but	1
God	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
hand;	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
thee	1
a	1
place	1
whither	1
he	1
shall	1
flee.	1
	1
21:14	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
come	1
presumptuously	1
upon	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
with	1
guile;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
mine	1
altar,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
smiteth	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
stealeth	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
selleth	1
him,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
curseth	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
if	1
men	1
strive	1
together,	1
and	1
one	1
smite	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
stone,	1
or	1
with	1
his	1
fist,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
not,	1
but	1
keepeth	1
his	1
bed:	1
21:19	1
If	1
he	1
rise	1
again,	1
and	1
walk	1
abroad	1
upon	1
his	1
staff,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
him	1
be	1
quit:	1
only	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
healed.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
his	1
servant,	1
or	1
his	1

he	1
die	1
under	1
his	1
hand;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
punished.	1
	1
21:21	1
Notwithstanding,	1
if	1
he	1
continue	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
punished:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
money.	1
	1
21:22	1
If	1
men	1
strive,	1
and	1
hurt	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
fruit	1

from	1
her,	1

he	1

according	1

the	1

husband	1
will	1
lay	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pay	1
as	1
the	1
judges	1
determine.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
mischief	1
follow,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
life	1
for	1
life,	1
21:24	1
Eye	1

Burning	1

	1
21:26	1
And	1
if	1
a	1

smite	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
or	1
the	1
eye	1

shall	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
free	1

his	1

	1
21:27	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
smite	1
out	1
his	1
manservant's	1

or	1
his	1

	1
21:28	1
If	1
an	1
ox	1
gore	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
they	1

then	1
the	1
ox	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
stoned,	1

his	1

but	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1

	1
21:29	1
But	1
if	1
the	1

	1
21:30	1
If	1

his	1

whatsoever	1

laid	1

him.	1
	1
21:31	1
Whether	1

gored	1
a	1

gored	1
a	1

according	1
to	1
this	1

shall	1
it	1

done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
21:32	1
If	1
the	1
ox	1

a	1

thirty	1

	1
21:33	1
And	1
if	1

The	1

And	1
if	1
one	1

another's,	1
that	1

that	1

	1
22:12	1
And	1
if	1

restitution	1
unto	1
the	1

	1
22:13	1
If	1

	1
22:14	1
And	1

hurt,	1

the	1

	1
22:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1

an	1
hired	1
thing,	1
it	1
came	1
for	1
his	1
hire.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1

a	1
maid	1
that	1

	1
22:17	1
If	1

pay	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1

of	1
virgins.	1
	1
22:18	1
Thou	1

a	1
witch	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
22:19	1
Whosoever	1
lieth	1
with	1
a	1
beast	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1

	1
22:20	1
He	1
that	1

unto	1
the	1
LORD	1

he	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
destroyed.	1
	1
22:21	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
neither	1
vex	1
a	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
oppress	1
him:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
22:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
afflict	1
any	1
widow,	1
or	1
fatherless	1
child.	1
	1
22:23	1
If	1
thou	1
afflict	1
them	1
in	1
any	1
wise,	1
and	1
they	1
cry	1
at	1
all	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
hear	1
their	1
cry;	1
22:24	1
And	1
my	1
wrath	1
shall	1
wax	1
hot,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
your	1
wives	1
shall	1
be	1
widows,	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
fatherless.	1
	1
22:25	1
If	1
thou	1
lend	1
money	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
poor	1
by	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
usurer,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lay	1
upon	1
him	1
usury.	1
	1
22:26	1
If	1
thou	1
at	1
all	1
take	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
raiment	1
to	1
pledge,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
goeth	1
down:	1
22:27	1
For	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
covering	1
only,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
raiment	1
for	1
his	1
skin:	1
wherein	1
shall	1
he	1
sleep?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
crieth	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
hear;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
gracious.	1
	1
22:28	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
revile	1
the	1
gods,	1
nor	1
curse	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
22:29	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
thy	1
ripe	1
fruits,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
liquors:	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
22:30	1
Likewise	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
with	1
thine	1
oxen,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
sheep:	1
seven	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
his	1
dam;	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
it	1
me.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
men	1
unto	1
me:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
any	1
flesh	1
that	1
is	1
torn	1
of	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
23:1	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
raise	1
a	1
false	1
report:	1
put	1
not	1
thine	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
unrighteous	1
witness.	1
	1
23:2	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
follow	1
a	1
multitude	1
to	1
do	1
evil;	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
to	1
decline	1
after	1
many	1
to	1
wrest	1
judgment:	1
23:3	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
countenance	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
cause.	1
	1
23:4	1
If	1
thou	1
meet	1
thine	1
enemy's	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
ass	1
going	1
astray,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
bring	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
23:5	1
If	1
thou	1
see	1
the	1
ass	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hateth	1
thee	1
lying	1
under	1
his	1
burden,	1
and	1
wouldest	1
forbear	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
help	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
23:6	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wrest	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
thy	1
poor	1
in	1
his	1
cause.	1
	1
23:7	1
Keep	1
thee	1
far	1
from	1
a	1
false	1
matter;	1
and	1
the	1
innocent	1
and	1
righteous	1
slay	1
thou	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
justify	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
no	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
blindeth	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
perverteth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
righteous.	1
	1
23:9	1
Also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
oppress	1
a	1
stranger:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
shalt	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof:	1
23:11	1
But	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
thou	1
shalt	1
let	1
it	1
rest	1
and	1
lie	1
still;	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
may	1
eat:	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
leave	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
eat.	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deal	1
with	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
oliveyard.	1
	1
23:12	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
thy	1
work,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest:	1
that	1
thine	1
ox	1
and	1
thine	1
ass	1
may	1
rest,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thy	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger,	1
may	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
be	1
circumspect:	1
and	1
make	1
no	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
other	1
gods,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:14	1
Three	1
times	1
thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
23:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
(thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
seven	1
days,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Abib;	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
thou	1
camest	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
me	1
empty:)	1
23:16	1
And	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
harvest,	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
labours,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
ingathering,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
gathered	1
in	1
thy	1
labours	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
23:17	1
Three	1
items	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
all	1
thy	1
males	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
23:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
offer	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
leavened	1
bread;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
23:19	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seethe	1
a	1
kid	1
in	1
his	1
mother's	1
milk.	1
	1
23:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
an	1
Angel	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
prepared.	1
	1
23:21	1
Beware	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
provoke	1
him	1
not;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
pardon	1
your	1
transgressions:	1
for	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
23:22	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
indeed	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
speak;	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
enemy	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
an	1
adversary	1
unto	1
thine	1
adversaries.	1
	1
23:23	1
For	1
mine	1
Angel	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
thee	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
them	1
off.	1
	1
23:24	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bow	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
gods,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them,	1
nor	1
do	1
after	1
their	1
works:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
utterly	1
overthrow	1
them,	1
and	1
quite	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
images.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bless	1
thy	1
bread,	1
and	1
thy	1
water;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
sickness	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
23:26	1
There	1
shall	1
nothing	1
cast	1
their	1
young,	1
nor	1
be	1
barren,	1
in	1
thy	1
land:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thy	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
fulfil.	1
	1
23:27	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
fear	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
turn	1
their	1
backs	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
hornets	1
before	1
thee,	1
which	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
from	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
23:29	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
one	1
year;	1
lest	1
the	1
land	1
become	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
multiply	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
23:30	1
By	1
little	1
and	1
little	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
be	1
increased,	1
and	1
inherit	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
thy	1
bounds	1
from	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
desert	1
unto	1
the	1
river:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
23:32	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
no	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
nor	1
with	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
23:33	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
lest	1
they	1
make	1
thee	1
sin	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
serve	1
their	1
gods,	1
it	1
will	1
surely	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Come	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
and	1
seventy	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
worship	1
ye	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
alone	1
shall	1
come	1
near	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
judgments:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
with	1
one	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
All	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
will	1
we	1
do.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
builded	1
an	1
altar	1
under	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
twelve	1
pillars,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
oxen	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
basons;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
and	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
and	1
be	1
obedient.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
made	1
with	1
you	1
concerning	1
all	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
went	1
up	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
and	1
seventy	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel:	1
24:10	1
And	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
paved	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
sapphire	1
stone,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
heaven	1
in	1
his	1
clearness.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
he	1
laid	1
not	1
his	1
hand:	1
also	1
they	1
saw	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Come	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
be	1
there:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
and	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
commandments	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
written;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
teach	1
them.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
minister	1
Joshua:	1
and	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
Tarry	1
ye	1
here	1
for	1
us,	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Hur	1
are	1
with	1
you:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
any	1
matters	1
to	1
do,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
abode	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it	1
six	1
days:	1
and	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
like	1
devouring	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Moses	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
25:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
me	1
an	1
offering:	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
giveth	1
it	1
willingly	1
with	1
his	1
heart	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
my	1
offering.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
offering	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
them;	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
25:4	1
And	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
goats'	1
hair,	1
25:5	1
And	1
rams'	1
skins	1
dyed	1
red,	1
and	1
badgers'	1
skins,	1
and	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
25:6	1
Oil	1
for	1
the	1
light,	1
spices	1
for	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
for	1
sweet	1
incense,	1
25:7	1
Onyx	1
stones,	1
and	1
stones	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
sanctuary;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
25:9	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
shew	1
thee,	1
after	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
thereof,	1
even	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
ark	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood:	1
two	1
cubits	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1
cubit	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1
cubit	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
the	1
height	1
thereof.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
overlay	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold,	1
within	1
and	1
without	1
shalt	1
thou	1
overlay	1
it,	1
and	1
shalt	1
make	1
upon	1
it	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
gold	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cast	1
four	1
rings	1
of	1
gold	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
thereof;	1
and	1
two	1
rings	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
two	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
staves	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
and	1
overlay	1
them	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
the	1
staves	1
into	1
the	1
rings	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
may	1
be	1
borne	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
25:15	1
The	1
staves	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
ark:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
thou	1

	1
28:31	1
And	1
thou	1

	1
28:32	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1

it	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
binding	1
of	1

about	1
the	1
hole	1

	1
28:33	1
And	1
beneath	1
upon	1
the	1

thou	1

28:34	1
A	1

and	1
a	1

	1
28:35	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
to	1
minister:	1
and	1
his	1
sound	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
holy	1

	1
28:36	1
And	1
thou	1

HOLINESS	1
TO	1
THE	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:37	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
blue	1
lace,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1

upon	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
mitre	1
it	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
28:38	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
forehead,	1
that	1
Aaron	1
may	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hallow	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
holy	1
gifts;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
always	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:39	1
And	1
thou	1

	1
28:40	1
And	1
for	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
coats,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
for	1

thou	1
make	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
for	1
beauty.	1
	1
28:41	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
them,	1
and	1
consecrate	1
them,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
28:42	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
them	1
linen	1
breeches	1
to	1
cover	1
their	1
nakedness;	1
from	1
the	1
loins	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
thighs	1
they	1
shall	1
reach:	1
28:43	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

or	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1

to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place;	1
that	1
they	1
bear	1
not	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
die:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
29:1	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
hallow	1
them,	1

Take	1

And	1

shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them.	1
	1
29:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1

and	1
bring	1

	1
29:4	1
And	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1

thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

wash	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
29:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1

Aaron	1
the	1

And	1
thou	1

mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
holy	1
crown	1
upon	1
the	1

	1
29:7	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
anoint	1
him.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
coats	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
29:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gird	1
them	1
with	1
girdles,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1

them:	1
and	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
shall	1
be	1
theirs	1
for	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
consecrate	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
29:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cause	1
a	1
bullock	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bullock.	1
	1
29:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
29:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
pour	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
beside	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
29:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
that	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
burn	1
them	1
upon	1

	1
29:14	1
But	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
his	1
skin,	1
and	1
his	1
dung,	1
shalt	1
thou	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
29:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
take	1
one	1
ram;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1

	1
29:16	1
And	1
thou	1

slay	1
the	1

and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1

	1
29:17	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
the	1
ram	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
wash	1
the	1

put	1
them	1

and	1
unto	1
his	1

	1
29:18	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
the	1
whole	1
ram	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1

unto	1
the	1

it	1
is	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
an	1

made	1
by	1

unto	1
the	1

	1
29:19	1
And	1
thou	1

	1
29:20	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
kill	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
his	1

and	1
put	1

	1
29:21	1
And	1

	1
29:22	1
Also	1

And	1

	1
29:25	1
And	1
thou	1

by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
29:33	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
wherewith	1
the	1
atonement	1
was	1
made,	1
to	1
consecrate	1
and	1
to	1
sanctify	1
them:	1
but	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
holy.	1
	1
29:34	1
And	1
if	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
consecrations,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
bread,	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
the	1
remainder	1
with	1
fire:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
holy.	1
	1
29:35	1
And	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
consecrate	1
them.	1
	1
29:36	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
atonement:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cleanse	1
the	1
altar,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
it,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
29:37	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
altar	1
most	1
holy:	1
whatsoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
29:38	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
two	1
lambs	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
continually.	1
	1
29:39	1
The	1
one	1
lamb	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
in	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lamb	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
at	1
even:	1
29:40	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
lamb	1
a	1
tenth	1
deal	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
beaten	1
oil;	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering.	1
	1
29:41	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
lamb	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
at	1
even,	1
and	1
shalt	1
do	1
thereto	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
thereof,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:42	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
you,	1
to	1
speak	1
there	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
29:43	1
And	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
shall	1
be	1
sanctified	1
by	1
my	1
glory.	1
	1
29:44	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sanctify	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
altar:	1
I	1
will	1
sanctify	1
also	1
both	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
to	1
minister	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
29:45	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
29:46	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
among	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
an	1
altar	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon:	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it.	1
	1
30:2	1
A	1
cubit	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1
cubit	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof;	1
foursquare	1
shall	1
it	1
be:	1
and	1
two	1
cubits	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
height	1
thereof:	1
the	1
horns	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
30:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
overlay	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold,	1
the	1
top	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
sides	1
thereof	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
horns	1
thereof;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
unto	1
it	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
gold	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
two	1
golden	1
rings	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
to	1
it	1
under	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
thereof,	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
it	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
places	1
for	1
the	1
staves	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
withal.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
the	1
staves	1
of	1
shittim	1
wood,	1
and	1
overlay	1
them	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
the	1
testimony,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
burn	1
thereon	1
sweet	1
incense	1
every	1
morning:	1
when	1
he	1
dresseth	1
the	1
lamps,	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
lighteth	1
the	1
lamps	1
at	1
even,	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
it,	1
a	1
perpetual	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
30:9	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
no	1
strange	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
nor	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
nor	1
meat	1
offering;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
pour	1
drink	1
offering	1
thereon.	1
	1
30:10	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
it	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
of	1
atonements:	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
shall	1
he	1
make	1
atonement	1
upon	1
it	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:12	1
When	1
thou	1
takest	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
their	1
number,	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
his	1
soul	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thou	1
numberest	1
them;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
plague	1
among	1
them,	1
when	1
thou	1
numberest	1
them.	1
	1
30:13	1
This	1
they	1
shall	1
give,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
numbered,	1
half	1
a	1
shekel	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
(a	1
shekel	1
is	1
twenty	1
gerahs:)	1
an	1
half	1
shekel	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:14	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
numbered,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above,	1
shall	1
give	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:15	1
The	1
rich	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
more,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
shekel,	1
when	1
they	1
give	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
atonement	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shalt	1
appoint	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
memorial	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:18	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
laver	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
his	1
foot	1
also	1
of	1
brass,	1
to	1
wash	1
withal:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
water	1
therein.	1
	1
30:19	1
For	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet	1
thereat:	1
30:20	1
When	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
they	1
shall	1
wash	1
with	1
water,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not;	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
minister,	1
to	1
burn	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
30:21	1
So	1
they	1
shall	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
30:22	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
30:23	1
Take	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
thee	1
principal	1
spices,	1
of	1
pure	1
myrrh	1
five	1
hundred	1
shekels,	1
and	1
of	1
sweet	1
cinnamon	1
half	1
so	1
much,	1
even	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
shekels,	1
and	1
of	1
sweet	1
calamus	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
shekels,	1
30:24	1
And	1
of	1
cassia	1
five	1
hundred	1
shekels,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
oil	1
olive	1
an	1
hin:	1
30:25	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
an	1
oil	1
of	1
holy	1
ointment,	1
an	1
ointment	1
compound	1
after	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
anointing	1
oil.	1
	1
30:26	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
therewith,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
30:27	1
And	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense,	1
30:28	1
And	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
30:29	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
holy:	1
whatsoever	1
toucheth	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
30:30	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
consecrate	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
30:31	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
anointing	1
oil	1
unto	1
me	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
30:32	1
Upon	1
man's	1
flesh	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
poured,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
any	1
other	1
like	1
it,	1
after	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
30:33	1
Whosoever	1
compoundeth	1
any	1
like	1
it,	1
or	1
whosoever	1
putteth	1
any	1
of	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
stranger,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
30:34	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Take	1
unto	1
thee	1
sweet	1
spices,	1
stacte,	1
and	1
onycha,	1
and	1
galbanum;	1
these	1
sweet	1
spices	1
with	1
pure	1
frankincense:	1
of	1
each	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
like	1
weight:	1
30:35	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
perfume,	1
a	1
confection	1
after	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
apothecary,	1
tempered	1
together,	1
pure	1
and	1
holy:	1
30:36	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
some	1
of	1
it	1
very	1
small,	1
and	1
put	1
of	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
thee:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
30:37	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
perfume	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
composition	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
holy	1
for	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:38	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
make	1
like	1
unto	1
that,	1
to	1
smell	1
thereto,	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
31:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:2	1
See,	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
by	1
name	1
Bezaleel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah:	1
31:3	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
in	1
understanding,	1
and	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship,	1
31:4	1
To	1
devise	1
cunning	1
works,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
brass,	1
31:5	1
And	1
in	1
cutting	1
of	1
stones,	1
to	1
set	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
carving	1
of	1
timber,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
with	1
him	1
Aholiab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahisamach,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
wise	1
hearted	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
wisdom,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
make	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee;	1
31:7	1
The	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
that	1
is	1
thereupon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
31:8	1
And	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
his	1
furniture,	1
and	1
the	1
pure	1
candlestick	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
furniture,	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense,	1
31:9	1
And	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
furniture,	1
and	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot,	1
31:10	1
And	1
the	1
cloths	1
of	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
garments	1
for	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
garments	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office,	1
31:11	1
And	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
sweet	1
incense	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee	1
shall	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
31:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
31:13	1
Speak	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Verily	1
my	1
sabbaths	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
doth	1
sanctify	1
you.	1
	1
31:14	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
sabbath	1
therefore;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
you:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
defileth	1
it	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
therein,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
31:15	1
Six	1
days	1
may	1
work	1
be	1
done;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
holy	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
31:16	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
sabbath	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations,	1
for	1
a	1
perpetual	1
covenant.	1
	1
31:17	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
rested,	1
and	1
was	1
refreshed.	1
	1
31:18	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
communing	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
testimony,	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
written	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
32:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
that	1
Moses	1
delayed	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount,	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Up,	1
make	1
us	1
gods,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
us;	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Break	1
off	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
your	1
wives,	1
of	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
daughters,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
32:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
brake	1
off	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
Aaron.	1
	1
32:4	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
them	1
at	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
fashioned	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
graving	1
tool,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
molten	1
calf:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
These	1
be	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
32:5	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
made	1
proclamation,	1
and	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
brought	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
32:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Go,	1
get	1
thee	1
down;	1
for	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
have	1
corrupted	1
themselves:	1
32:8	1
They	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
molten	1
calf,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
thereunto,	1
and	1
said,	1
These	1
be	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
which	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
32:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
this	1
people,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
32:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
alone,	1
that	1
my	1
wrath	1
may	1
wax	1
hot	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
nation.	1
	1
32:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
why	1
doth	1
thy	1
wrath	1
wax	1
hot	1
against	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand?	1
32:12	1
Wherefore	1
should	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
speak,	1
and	1
say,	1
For	1
mischief	1
did	1
he	1
bring	1
them	1
out,	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
to	1
consume	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
Turn	1
from	1
thy	1
fierce	1
wrath,	1
and	1
repent	1
of	1
this	1
evil	1
against	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
32:13	1
Remember	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
servants,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
swarest	1
by	1
thine	1
own	1
self,	1
and	1
saidst	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
land	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
it	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
32:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
32:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
turned,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
written	1
on	1
both	1
their	1
sides;	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
they	1
written.	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
God,	1
graven	1
upon	1
the	1
tables.	1
	1
32:17	1
And	1
when	1
Joshua	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
they	1
shouted,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
32:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
shout	1
for	1
mastery,	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
cry	1
for	1
being	1
overcome:	1
but	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sing	1
do	1
I	1
hear.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
camp,	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
dancing:	1
and	1
Moses'	1
anger	1
waxed	1
hot,	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
the	1
tables	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
beneath	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
calf	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
ground	1
it	1
to	1
powder,	1
and	1
strawed	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
drink	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
32:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
What	1
did	1
this	1
people	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
sin	1
upon	1
them?	1
	1
32:22	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
wax	1
hot:	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
set	1
on	1
mischief.	1
	1
32:23	1
For	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods,	1
which	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
32:24	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
hath	1
any	1
gold,	1
let	1
them	1
break	1
it	1
off.	1
So	1
they	1
gave	1
it	1
me:	1
then	1
I	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
this	1
calf.	1
	1
32:25	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
naked;	1
(for	1
Aaron	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
naked	1
unto	1
their	1
shame	1
among	1
their	1
enemies:)	1
32:26	1
Then	1
Moses	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
LORD's	1
side?	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Put	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
from	1
gate	1
to	1
gate	1
throughout	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
slay	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
companion,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
32:28	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Levi	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
day	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
32:29	1
For	1
Moses	1
had	1
said,	1
Consecrate	1
yourselves	1
today	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
every	1
man	1
upon	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
brother;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bestow	1
upon	1
you	1
a	1
blessing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
32:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
have	1
sinned	1
a	1
great	1
sin:	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
sin.	1
	1
32:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh,	1
this	1
people	1
have	1
sinned	1
a	1
great	1
sin,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
gods	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
32:32	1
Yet	1
now,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
forgive	1
their	1
sin--;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
blot	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
book	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
written.	1
	1
32:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Whosoever	1
hath	1
sinned	1
against	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
blot	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
book.	1
	1
32:34	1
Therefore	1
now	1
go,	1
lead	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
mine	1
Angel	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
thee:	1
nevertheless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
visit	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
their	1
sin	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
32:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
plagued	1
the	1
people,	1
because	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
calf,	1
which	1
Aaron	1
made.	1
	1
33:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Depart,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
hence,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
to	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
saying,	1
Unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it:	1
33:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
an	1
angel	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite:	1
33:3	1
Unto	1
a	1
land	1
flowing	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
lest	1
I	1
consume	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
33:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
these	1
evil	1
tidings,	1
they	1
mourned:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
did	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
his	1
ornaments.	1
	1
33:5	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Say	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
are	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
consume	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
now	1
put	1
off	1
thy	1
ornaments	1
from	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
33:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
stripped	1
themselves	1
of	1
their	1
ornaments	1
by	1
the	1
mount	1
Horeb.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
pitched	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
afar	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
Tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
which	1
was	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
33:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
stood	1
every	1
man	1
at	1
his	1
tent	1
door,	1
and	1
looked	1
after	1
Moses,	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
33:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Moses	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
the	1
cloudy	1
pillar	1
descended,	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
talked	1
with	1
Moses.	1
	1
33:10	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
the	1
cloudy	1
pillar	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
door:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
tent	1
door.	1
	1
33:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
his	1
friend.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
camp:	1
but	1
his	1
servant	1
Joshua,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
departed	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
See,	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me,	1
Bring	1
up	1
this	1
people:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
whom	1
thou	1
wilt	1
send	1
with	1
me.	1
Yet	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
33:13	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
shew	1
me	1
now	1
thy	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight:	1
and	1
consider	1
that	1
this	1
nation	1
is	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
33:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
My	1
presence	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
rest.	1
	1
33:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thy	1
presence	1
go	1
not	1
with	1
me,	1
carry	1
us	1
not	1
up	1
hence.	1
	1
33:16	1
For	1
wherein	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
here	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
with	1
us?	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
separated,	1
I	1
and	1
thy	1
people,	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
33:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
also	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
33:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
33:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
my	1
goodness	1
pass	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
proclaim	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
gracious,	1
and	1
will	1
shew	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
mercy.	1
	1
33:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
see	1
me,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
33:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stand	1
upon	1
a	1
rock:	1
33:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
my	1
glory	1
passeth	1
by,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
clift	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
will	1
cover	1
thee	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
while	1
I	1
pass	1
by:	1
33:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
my	1
back	1
parts:	1
but	1
my	1
face	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
seen.	1
	1
34:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Hew	1
thee	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
upon	1
these	1
tables	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
tables,	1
which	1
thou	1
brakest.	1
	1
34:2	1
And	1
be	1
ready	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
present	1
thyself	1
there	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
34:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
thee,	1
neither	1
let	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
seen	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
mount;	1
neither	1
let	1
the	1
flocks	1
nor	1
herds	1
feed	1
before	1
that	1
mount.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
he	1
hewed	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
first;	1
and	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
descended	1
in	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
him	1
there,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
passed	1
by	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
proclaimed,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God,	1
merciful	1
and	1
gracious,	1
longsuffering,	1
and	1
abundant	1
in	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth,	1
34:7	1
Keeping	1
mercy	1
for	1
thousands,	1
forgiving	1
iniquity	1
and	1
transgression	1
and	1
sin,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
clear	1
the	1
guilty;	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
children's	1
children,	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
	1
34:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
let	1
my	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
go	1
among	1
us;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
stiffnecked	1
people;	1
and	1
pardon	1
our	1
iniquity	1
and	1
our	1
sin,	1
and	1
take	1
us	1
for	1
thine	1
inheritance.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant:	1
before	1
all	1
thy	1
people	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
marvels,	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
in	1
any	1
nation:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
among	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
34:11	1
Observe	1
thou	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
I	1
drive	1
out	1
before	1
thee	1
the	1
Amorite,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzite,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivite,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
34:12	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
lest	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
snare	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
34:13	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
destroy	1
their	1
altars,	1
break	1
their	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
their	1
groves:	1
34:14	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
no	1
other	1
god:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
Jealous,	1
is	1
a	1
jealous	1
God:	1
34:15	1
Lest	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
one	1
call	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
sacrifice;	1
34:16	1
And	1
thou	1
take	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
unto	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
sons	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
34:17	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
thee	1
no	1
molten	1
gods.	1
	1
34:18	1
The	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
shalt	1
thou	1
keep.	1
Seven	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Abib:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Abib	1
thou	1
camest	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt.	1
	1
34:19	1
All	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
is	1
mine;	1
and	1
every	1
firstling	1
among	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
whether	1
ox	1
or	1
sheep,	1
that	1
is	1
male.	1
	1
34:20	1
But	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem	1
with	1
a	1
lamb:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
redeem	1
him	1
not,	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
break	1
his	1
neck.	1
All	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
thou	1
shalt	1
redeem.	1
And	1
none	1
shall	1
appear	1
before	1
me	1
empty.	1
	1
34:21	1
Six	1
days	1
thou	1
shalt	1
work,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest:	1
in	1
earing	1
time	1
and	1
in	1
harvest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest.	1
	1
34:22	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
observe	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
weeks,	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
ingathering	1
at	1
the	1
year's	1
end.	1
	1
34:23	1
Thrice	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
shall	1
all	1
your	1
menchildren	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
34:24	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
nations	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
borders:	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
desire	1
thy	1
land,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
thrice	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
34:25	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
offer	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
leaven;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover	1
be	1
left	1
unto	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
34:26	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
seethe	1
a	1
kid	1
in	1
his	1
mother's	1
milk.	1
	1
34:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Write	1
thou	1
these	1
words:	1
for	1
after	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
34:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights;	1
he	1
did	1
neither	1
eat	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water.	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
upon	1
the	1
tables	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
the	1
ten	1
commandments.	1
	1
34:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Moses	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
testimony	1
in	1
Moses'	1
hand,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount,	1
that	1
Moses	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
shone	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
34:30	1
And	1
when	1
Aaron	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
Moses,	1
behold,	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
shone;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1
come	1
nigh	1
him.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
returned	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
Moses	1
talked	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
34:32	1
And	1
afterward	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
nigh:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
in	1
commandment	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
spoken	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai.	1
	1
34:33	1
And	1
till	1
Moses	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
34:34	1
But	1
when	1
Moses	1
went	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
vail	1
off,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
out.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
commanded.	1
	1
34:35	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses,	1
that	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
Moses'	1
face	1
shone:	1
and	1
Moses	1
put	1
the	1
vail	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
again,	1
until	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
35:1	1
And	1
Moses	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
35:2	1
Six	1
days	1
shall	1
work	1
be	1
done,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
an	1
holy	1
day,	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
work	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
35:3	1
Ye	1
shall	1
kindle	1
no	1
fire	1
throughout	1
your	1
habitations	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
35:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
35:5	1
Take	1
ye	1
from	1
among	1
you	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
whosoever	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
willing	1
heart,	1
let	1
him	1
bring	1
it,	1

	1
35:10	1
And	1
every	1

hearted	1
among	1
you	1

commanded	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
35:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
See,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
by	1
name	1
Bezaleel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah;	1
35:31	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
filled	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
wisdom,	1
in	1
understanding,	1
and	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship;	1
35:32	1
And	1
to	1
devise	1
curious	1
works,	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
brass,	1
35:33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
cutting	1
of	1
stones,	1
to	1
set	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
carving	1
of	1
wood,	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
cunning	1
work.	1
	1
35:34	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
teach,	1
both	1
he,	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahisamach,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan.	1
	1
35:35	1
Them	1
hath	1
he	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
heart,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
work,	1
of	1
the	1
engraver,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
cunning	1
workman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
embroiderer,	1
in	1
blue,	1
and	1
in	1
purple,	1
in	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
weaver,	1
even	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
any	1
work,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
devise	1
cunning	1
work.	1
	1
36:1	1
Then	1
wrought	1
Bezaleel	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
and	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man,	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
36:2	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Bezaleel	1
and	1
Aholiab,	1
and	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man,	1
in	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
put	1
wisdom,	1
even	1
every	1
one	1
whose	1
heart	1
stirred	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
it:	1
36:3	1
And	1
they	1
received	1
of	1
Moses	1
all	1
the	1
offering,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
brought	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
withal.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
yet	1
unto	1
him	1
free	1
offerings	1
every	1
morning.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
that	1
wrought	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
came	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
made;	1
36:5	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
The	1
people	1
bring	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
make.	1
	1
36:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
gave	1
commandment,	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
throughout	1
the	1
camp,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
make	1
any	1
more	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
restrained	1
from	1
bringing.	1
	1
36:7	1
For	1
the	1
stuff	1
they	1
had	1
was	1
sufficient	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
make	1
it,	1
and	1
too	1
much.	1
	1
36:8	1
And	1
every	1
wise	1
hearted	1
man	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
wrought	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
made	1
ten	1
curtains	1
of	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen,	1
and	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet:	1
with	1
cherubims	1
of	1
cunning	1
work	1
made	1
he	1
them.	1
	1
36:9	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
one	1
curtain	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
eight	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
one	1
curtain	1
four	1
cubits:	1
the	1
curtains	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
size.	1
	1
36:10	1
And	1
he	1
coupled	1
the	1
five	1
curtains	1
one	1
unto	1
another:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
five	1
curtains	1
he	1
coupled	1
one	1
unto	1
another.	1
	1
36:11	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
loops	1
of	1
blue	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
one	1
curtain	1
from	1
the	1
selvedge	1
in	1
the	1
coupling:	1
likewise	1
he	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
side	1
of	1
another	1
curtain,	1
in	1
the	1

	1
39:1	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
they	1
made	1
cloths	1
of	1
service,	1
to	1

service	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
made	1

	1
39:3	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
beat	1
the	1
gold	1
into	1
thin	1
plates,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
wires,	1
to	1

and	1
in	1

work.	1
	1
39:4	1
They	1
made	1
shoulderpieces	1
for	1
it,	1
to	1
couple	1
it	1
together:	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
edges	1
was	1
it	1
coupled	1
together.	1
	1
39:5	1
And	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
his	1
ephod,	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
it,	1
was	1
of	1
the	1

according	1
to	1
the	1

thereof;	1
of	1
gold,	1
blue,	1

and	1
fine	1
twined	1

	1
39:6	1
And	1
they	1
wrought	1
onyx	1
stones	1
inclosed	1
in	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold,	1
graven,	1
as	1
signets	1
are	1
graven,	1
with	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
39:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
stones	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:8	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
cunning	1
work,	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ephod;	1
of	1
gold,	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
fine	1
twined	1
linen.	1
	1
39:9	1
It	1
was	1
foursquare;	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
breastplate	1
double:	1
a	1
span	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
a	1
span	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
being	1
doubled.	1
	1
39:10	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
in	1
it	1
four	1
rows	1
of	1
stones:	1
the	1
first	1
row	1
was	1
a	1
sardius,	1
a	1
topaz,	1
and	1
a	1
carbuncle:	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
row.	1
	1
39:11	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
row,	1
an	1
emerald,	1
a	1
sapphire,	1
and	1
a	1
diamond.	1
	1
39:12	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
row,	1
a	1
ligure,	1
an	1
agate,	1
and	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
39:13	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
row,	1
a	1
beryl,	1
an	1
onyx,	1
and	1
a	1
jasper:	1
they	1
were	1
inclosed	1
in	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
their	1
inclosings.	1
	1
39:14	1
And	1
the	1
stones	1
were	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
twelve,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
names,	1
like	1
the	1
engravings	1
of	1
a	1
signet,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
name,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes.	1
	1
39:15	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
breastplate	1
chains	1
at	1
the	1
ends,	1
of	1
wreathen	1
work	1
of	1
pure	1
gold.	1
	1
39:16	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
ouches	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
two	1
gold	1
rings;	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
two	1
rings	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
39:17	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
two	1
wreathen	1
chains	1
of	1
gold	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
rings	1
on	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate.	1
	1
39:18	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
wreathen	1
chains	1
they	1
fastened	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
ouches,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
shoulderpieces	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
39:19	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
rings	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
breastplate,	1
upon	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
inward.	1
	1
39:20	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
two	1
other	1
golden	1
rings,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
underneath,	1
toward	1
the	1
forepart	1
of	1
it,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
coupling	1
thereof,	1
above	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod.	1
	1
39:21	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
bind	1
the	1
breastplate	1
by	1
his	1
rings	1
unto	1
the	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
with	1
a	1
lace	1
of	1
blue,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
above	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
breastplate	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
ephod;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:22	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
robe	1
of	1
the	1
ephod	1
of	1
woven	1
work,	1
all	1
of	1
blue.	1
	1
39:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
robe,	1
as	1
the	1
hole	1
of	1
an	1
habergeon,	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
hole,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
rend.	1
	1
39:24	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
hems	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
pomegranates	1
of	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
twined	1
linen.	1
	1
39:25	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
bells	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bells	1
between	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
upon	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
the	1
robe,	1
round	1
about	1
between	1
the	1
pomegranates;	1
39:26	1
A	1
bell	1
and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1
a	1

and	1
a	1
pomegranate,	1

of	1
the	1
robe	1
to	1
minister	1
in;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:27	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
coats	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
of	1
woven	1
work	1
for	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
sons,	1
39:28	1
And	1
a	1
mitre	1
of	1
fine	1

of	1

breeches	1
of	1

39:29	1
And	1
a	1

blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
of	1
needlework;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:30	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
plate	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
crown	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
and	1
wrote	1
upon	1
it	1
a	1
writing,	1
like	1
to	1
the	1
engravings	1
of	1
a	1
signet,	1
HOLINESS	1
TO	1
THE	1
LORD.	1
	1
39:31	1
And	1
they	1
tied	1
unto	1
it	1
a	1
lace	1
of	1
blue,	1
to	1
fasten	1
it	1
on	1
high	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
39:32	1
Thus	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
finished:	1

the	1

of	1
Israel	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
they.	1
	1
39:33	1
And	1
they	1

office.	1
	1
39:42	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
39:43	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
look	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
work,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded,	1
even	1
so	1
had	1
they	1
done	1
it:	1
and	1
Moses	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
40:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
40:2	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
40:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
therein	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
cover	1
the	1
ark	1
with	1
the	1
vail.	1
	1
40:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
light	1
the	1
lamps	1
thereof.	1
	1
40:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
gold	1
for	1
the	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
hanging	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
40:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
laver	1
between	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
shalt	1
put	1
water	1
therein.	1
	1
40:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
hang	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
court	1
gate.	1
	1
40:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
anoint	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
and	1
shalt	1
hallow	1
it,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
thereof:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
40:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
altar	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
40:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
it.	1
	1
40:12	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
wash	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
40:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
upon	1
Aaron	1
the	1
holy	1
garments,	1
and	1
anoint	1
him,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
him;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
40:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
clothe	1
them	1
with	1
coats:	1
40:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
anoint	1
their	1
father,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office:	1
for	1
their	1
anointing	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
priesthood	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
40:16	1
Thus	1
did	1
Moses:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
40:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
reared	1
up.	1
	1
40:18	1
And	1
Moses	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
fastened	1
his	1
sockets,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
boards	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
bars	1
thereof,	1
and	1
reared	1
up	1
his	1
pillars.	1
	1
40:19	1
And	1
he	1
spread	1
abroad	1
the	1
tent	1
over	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
above	1
upon	1
it;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:20	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
testimony	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
staves	1
on	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
above	1
upon	1
the	1
ark:	1
40:21	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
ark	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
vail	1
of	1
the	1
covering,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
testimony;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:22	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
upon	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
northward,	1
without	1
the	1
vail.	1
	1
40:23	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
bread	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:24	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
candlestick	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
southward.	1
	1
40:25	1
And	1
he	1
lighted	1
the	1
lamps	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:26	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
in	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
vail:	1
40:27	1
And	1
he	1
burnt	1
sweet	1
incense	1
thereon;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:28	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:29	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
offered	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offering;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:30	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
laver	1
between	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
put	1
water	1
there,	1
to	1
wash	1
withal.	1
	1
40:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
washed	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet	1
thereat:	1
40:32	1
When	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
they	1
washed;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
40:33	1
And	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
court	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
hanging	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
gate.	1
So	1
Moses	1
finished	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
40:34	1
Then	1
a	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:35	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
because	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
thereon,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
40:36	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
over	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
onward	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
journeys:	1
40:37	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
cloud	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
up,	1
then	1
they	1
journeyed	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
up.	1
	1
40:38	1
For	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
fire	1
was	1
on	1
it	1
by	1
night,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
throughout	1
all	1
their	1
journeys.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Third	1
Book	1
of	1
Moses:	1
	1
Called	1
Leviticus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
shall	1
bring	1
your	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
cattle,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
1:3	1
If	1
his	1
offering	1
be	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
let	1
him	1
offer	1
a	1
male	1
without	1
blemish:	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
voluntary	1
will	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
blood	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
flay	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pieces.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
put	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
fire:	1
1:8	1
And	1
the	1
priests,	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
shall	1
lay	1
the	1
parts,	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
fat,	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
wood	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
1:9	1
But	1
his	1
inwards	1
and	1
his	1
legs	1
shall	1
he	1
wash	1
in	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
altar,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
an	1

And	1
if	1

namely,	1
of	1
the	1

But	1
he	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
wring	1

of	1
the	1

And	1
he	1

	1
2:6	1
Thou	1

And	1

	1
2:10	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1

shall	1
be	1
Aaron's	1
and	1

a	1
thing	1
most	1
holy	1
of	1
the	1

	1
2:11	1
No	1

	1
2:12	1
As	1

	1
2:13	1
And	1
every	1

of	1
thy	1

thou	1
season	1

thou	1

	1
2:14	1
And	1
if	1

	1
2:15	1
And	1
thou	1

upon	1
it,	1
and	1
lay	1
frankincense	1
thereon:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1

	1
2:16	1
And	1
the	1

When	1
the	1

	1
4:18	1

	1
4:20	1
And	1
he	1

	1
5:10	1
And	1
he	1

But	1

the	1
tenth	1

an	1

	1
5:12	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1

unto	1
the	1

it	1

	1
5:13	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
touching	1
his	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1

sinned	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
these,	1

the	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's,	1
as	1
a	1
meat	1

	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1

unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1

If	1

a	1
trespass,	1
and	1
sin	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
for	1
his	1
trespass	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
ram	1
without	1

out	1
of	1
the	1

with	1
thy	1

by	1
shekels	1
of	1

after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1

	1
5:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
the	1
harm	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1

give	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1

make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1

	1
5:17	1
And	1
if	1
a	1

sin,	1

these	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
forbidden	1

yet	1
is	1
he	1
guilty,	1
and	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
he	1

it	1

	1
5:19	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
he	1
hath	1
certainly	1
trespassed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:2	1
If	1
a	1
soul	1
sin,	1
and	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
lie	1

in	1
that	1
which	1

or	1
in	1
a	1
thing	1
taken	1
away	1
by	1

hath	1
deceived	1
his	1

6:3	1
Or	1
have	1

that	1
which	1

lieth	1
concerning	1
it,	1
and	1
sweareth	1

in	1
any	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth,	1
sinning	1
therein:	1
6:4	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
sinned,	1
and	1
is	1
guilty,	1
that	1
he	1

that	1
which	1

6:5	1
Or	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
sworn	1
falsely;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
restore	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
principal,	1
and	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1

it	1
appertaineth,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
ram	1
without	1

with	1
thy	1

for	1

6:7	1
And	1
the	1

shall	1
make	1
an	1

for	1
him	1
before	1
the	1

of	1
all	1
that	1

	1
6:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:9	1
Command	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
all	1
night	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
burning	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
linen	1
garment,	1
and	1
his	1
linen	1
breeches	1
shall	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
his	1

and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
ashes	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
on	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
them	1
beside	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
carry	1
forth	1
the	1
ashes	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
unto	1
a	1
clean	1
place.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
burning	1
in	1
it;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
out:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
wood	1
on	1
it	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
burn	1
thereon	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
6:13	1
The	1
fire	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
burning	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
go	1
out.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering:	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
before	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
it	1
his	1
handful,	1
of	1
the	1
flour	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1

thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
frankincense	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
meat	1

and	1
shall	1
burn	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1

for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
even	1
the	1
memorial	1
of	1
it,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1
remainder	1
thereof	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
eat:	1
with	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place;	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
6:17	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
baken	1
with	1
leaven.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire;	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
6:18	1
All	1
the	1
males	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations	1
concerning	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
toucheth	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:20	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
Aaron	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
anointed;	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
fine	1
flour	1
for	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
perpetual,	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
half	1
thereof	1
at	1
night.	1
	1
6:21	1
In	1
a	1
pan	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
oil;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
baken,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
it	1
in:	1
and	1
the	1
baken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
shalt	1
thou	1
offer	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
is	1
anointed	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
shall	1
offer	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
burnt.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
every	1
meat	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
be	1
wholly	1
burnt:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:25	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering:	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
is	1
killed	1
shall	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
be	1
killed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
6:26	1
The	1
priest	1
that	1
offereth	1
it	1
for	1
sin	1
shall	1
eat	1
it:	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
eaten,	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
6:27	1
Whatsoever	1
shall	1
touch	1
the	1
flesh	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
and	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
sprinkled	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof	1
upon	1
any	1
garment,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
wash	1
that	1
whereon	1
it	1
was	1
sprinkled	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
6:28	1
But	1
the	1
earthen	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
it	1
is	1
sodden	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
sodden	1
in	1
a	1
brasen	1
pot,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
both	1
scoured,	1
and	1
rinsed	1
in	1
water.	1
	1
6:29	1
All	1
the	1
males	1
among	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
no	1
sin	1
offering,	1
whereof	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
reconcile	1

in	1
the	1

shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
7:1	1
Likewise	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
7:2	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
kill	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
shall	1
they	1
kill	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
thereof;	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
flanks,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
that	1
is	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
with	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
it	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
away:	1
7:5	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
7:6	1
Every	1
male	1
among	1
the	1
priests	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy.	1
	1
7:7	1
As	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
law	1
for	1
them:	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
maketh	1
atonement	1
therewith	1
shall	1
have	1
it.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
that	1
offereth	1
any	1
man's	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
even	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
offered.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
that	1
is	1
baken	1
in	1
the	1
oven,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
fryingpan,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
pan,	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's	1
that	1
offereth	1
it.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
every	1
meat	1
offering,	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
dry,	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
have,	1
one	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
another.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:12	1
If	1
he	1
offer	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
thanksgiving,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
with	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
unleavened	1

anointed	1
with	1

and	1
cakes	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
of	1
fine	1
flour,	1
fried.	1
	1
7:13	1
Besides	1
the	1
cakes,	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
for	1
his	1
offering	1
leavened	1
bread	1
with	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
shall	1
offer	1
one	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
oblation	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's	1
that	1
sprinkleth	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings	1
for	1
thanksgiving	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
offered;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
any	1
of	1
it	1

the	1
morning.	1
	1
7:16	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
offering	1
be	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
a	1
voluntary	1
offering,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
offereth	1
his	1
sacrifice:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
also	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten:	1
7:17	1
But	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings	1
be	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted,	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination,	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
that	1
toucheth	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
clean	1
shall	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:20	1
But	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1

unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
having	1
his	1
uncleanness	1
upon	1
him,	1
even	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
7:21	1
Moreover	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
shall	1
touch	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing,	1
as	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
man,	1
or	1
any	1

beast,	1
or	1
any	1
abominable	1

that	1

be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1

	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
7:23	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
fat,	1
of	1
ox,	1
or	1
of	1
sheep,	1
or	1
of	1
goat.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
itself,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
torn	1
with	1
beasts,	1
may	1
be	1
used	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
use:	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
7:25	1
For	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
of	1
which	1
men	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1

	1
7:26	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
blood,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
fowl	1
or	1
of	1
beast,	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
your	1

	1
7:27	1
Whatsoever	1
soul	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1

even	1
that	1

shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
his	1

	1
7:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
7:29	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
He	1
that	1
offereth	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
his	1
oblation	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:30	1
His	1
own	1
hands	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
the	1
fat	1
with	1
the	1
breast,	1
it	1
shall	1
he	1
bring,	1
that	1
the	1
breast	1
may	1
be	1
waved	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
but	1
the	1
breast	1
shall	1
be	1
Aaron's	1
and	1
his	1
sons'.	1
	1
7:32	1
And	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
shall	1
ye	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
your	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
7:33	1
He	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
offereth	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
fat,	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
for	1
his	1
part.	1
	1
7:34	1
For	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
the	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
their	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
sons	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office;	1
7:36	1
Which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
anointed	1
them,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
of	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
consecrations,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
7:38	1
Which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
offer	1
their	1
oblations	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Take	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
garments,	1
and	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
two	1
rams,	1
and	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread;	1
8:3	1
And	1
gather	1
thou	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
washed	1
them	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
coat,	1
and	1
girded	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
girdle,	1
and	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
robe,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
ephod	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
girded	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
curious	1
girdle	1
of	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
bound	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
therewith.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
breastplate	1
upon	1
him:	1
also	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
breastplate	1
the	1
Urim	1
and	1
the	1
Thummim.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
mitre,	1
even	1
upon	1
his	1
forefront,	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
golden	1
plate,	1
the	1
holy	1
crown;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
them.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
thereof	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
vessels,	1
both	1
the	1
laver	1
and	1
his	1
foot,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
poured	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
head,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
him.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
and	1
put	1
coats	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
girded	1
them	1
with	1
girdles,	1
and	1
put	1
bonnets	1
upon	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
finger,	1
and	1
purified	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
poured	1
the	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
it,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
their	1
fat,	1
and	1
Moses	1
burned	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
8:17	1
But	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
his	1
hide,	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
his	1
dung,	1
he	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
ram	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
he	1
cut	1
the	1
ram	1
into	1
pieces;	1
and	1
Moses	1
burnt	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
pieces,	1
and	1
the	1
fat.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
washed	1
the	1
inwards	1
and	1
the	1
legs	1
in	1
water;	1
and	1
Moses	1
burnt	1
the	1
whole	1
ram	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour,	1
and	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
other	1
ram,	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
consecration:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
ram.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
it;	1
and	1
Moses	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
Aaron's	1
right	1
ear,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
thumb	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
toe	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
foot.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
Aaron's	1
sons,	1
and	1
Moses	1
put	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
ear,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
thumbs	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
toes	1
of	1
their	1
right	1
feet:	1
and	1
Moses	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fat	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
their	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder:	1
8:26	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
basket	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
took	1
one	1
unleavened	1
cake,	1
and	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
oiled	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
wafer,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder:	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
upon	1
Aaron's	1
hands,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons'	1
hands,	1
and	1
waved	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
upon	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering:	1
they	1
were	1
consecrations	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour:	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
breast,	1
and	1
waved	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
consecration	1
it	1
was	1
Moses'	1
part;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
upon	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons'	1
garments	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
sanctified	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
sons'	1
garments	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
Boil	1
the	1
flesh	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
there	1
eat	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
basket	1
of	1
consecrations,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
shall	1
ye	1
burn	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
in	1
seven	1
days,	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
consecration	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end:	1
for	1
seven	1
days	1
shall	1
he	1
consecrate	1
you.	1
	1
8:34	1
As	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
day,	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
to	1
do,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:35	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
abide	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
ye	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
commanded.	1
	1
8:36	1
So	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
that	1
Moses	1
called	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
thee	1
a	1
young	1
calf	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
without	1
blemish,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
ye	1
a	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering;	1
and	1
a	1
calf	1
and	1
a	1
lamb,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year,	1
without	1
blemish,	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
9:4	1
Also	1
a	1
bullock	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil:	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
that	1
which	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
drew	1
near	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Go	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
offer	1
thy	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
thy	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
thyself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
offer	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
them;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded.	1
	1
9:8	1
Aaron	1
therefore	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
brought	1
the	1
blood	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
dipped	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
blood	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
9:10	1
But	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
he	1
burnt	1
upon	1
the	1
altar;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
hide	1
he	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
they	1
presented	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
pieces	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
head:	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
wash	1
the	1
inwards	1
and	1
the	1
legs,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
on	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
people's	1
offering,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
goat,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
slew	1
it,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
for	1
sin,	1
as	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
handful	1
thereof,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
beside	1
the	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
9:18	1
He	1
slew	1
also	1
the	1
bullock	1
and	1
the	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
sons	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about,	1
9:19	1
And	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
bullock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ram,	1
the	1
rump,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
covereth	1
the	1
inwards,	1
and	1
the	1
kidneys,	1
and	1
the	1
caul	1
above	1
the	1
liver:	1
9:20	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
breasts,	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
the	1
fat	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
9:21	1
And	1
the	1
breasts	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
Aaron	1
waved	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Aaron	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
fire	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consumed	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
fat:	1
which	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw,	1
they	1
shouted,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
Nadab	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
took	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
and	1
offered	1
strange	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:3	1
Then	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
This	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
come	1
nigh	1
me,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified.	1
And	1
Aaron	1
held	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Mishael	1
and	1
Elzaphan,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Uzziel	1
the	1
uncle	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
near,	1
carry	1
your	1
brethren	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
10:5	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
near,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
coats	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp;	1
as	1
Moses	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
unto	1
Ithamar,	1
his	1
sons,	1
Uncover	1
not	1
your	1
heads,	1
neither	1
rend	1
your	1
clothes;	1
lest	1
ye	1
die,	1
and	1
lest	1
wrath	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
brethren,	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
bewail	1
the	1
burning	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
kindled.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die:	1
for	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
10:9	1
Do	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
thou,	1
nor	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee,	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations:	1
10:10	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
difference	1
between	1
holy	1
and	1
unholy,	1
and	1
between	1
unclean	1
and	1
clean;	1
10:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
statutes	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
unto	1
Ithamar,	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
were	1
left,	1
Take	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
that	1
remaineth	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
without	1
leaven	1
beside	1
the	1
altar:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy:	1
10:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
thy	1
due,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
due,	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
place;	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
thy	1
due,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
due,	1
which	1
are	1
given	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:15	1
The	1
heave	1
shoulder	1
and	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
shall	1
they	1
bring	1
with	1
the	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
fat,	1
to	1
wave	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
wave	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons'	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Moses	1
diligently	1
sought	1
the	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
burnt:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
Ithamar,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
alive,	1
saying,	1
10:17	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
eaten	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
you	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
for	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold,	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
in	1
within	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
ye	1
should	1
indeed	1
have	1
eaten	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
as	1
I	1
commanded.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
they	1
offered	1
their	1
sin	1
offering	1
and	1
their	1
burnt	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
have	1
befallen	1
me:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
the	1
sin	1

should	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
content.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
11:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
beasts	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
Whatsoever	1
parteth	1
the	1
hoof,	1
and	1
is	1
clovenfooted,	1
and	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
among	1
the	1
beasts,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat.	1
	1
11:4	1
Nevertheless	1
these	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
chew	1
the	1
cud,	1
or	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
divide	1
the	1
hoof:	1
as	1
the	1
camel,	1
because	1
he	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divideth	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
coney,	1
because	1
he	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divideth	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
hare,	1
because	1
he	1
cheweth	1
the	1
cud,	1
but	1
divideth	1
not	1
the	1
hoof;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1
swine,	1
though	1
he	1
divide	1
the	1
hoof,	1
and	1
be	1
clovenfooted,	1
yet	1
he	1
cheweth	1
not	1
the	1
cud;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:8	1
Of	1
their	1
flesh	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
eat,	1
and	1
their	1
carcase	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
touch;	1
they	1
are	1
unclean	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:9	1
These	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
waters:	1
whatsoever	1
hath	1
fins	1
and	1
scales	1
in	1
the	1
waters,	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1

them	1

	1
11:10	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
have	1
not	1

in	1
the	1

and	1
in	1

of	1
all	1

in	1
the	1

and	1
of	1
any	1
living	1
thing	1
which	1

they	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you:	1
11:11	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you;	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
their	1
flesh,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
their	1
carcases	1
in	1
abomination.	1
	1
11:12	1
Whatsoever	1
hath	1
no	1
fins	1
nor	1

in	1
the	1
waters,	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
abomination	1
among	1
the	1
fowls;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten,	1
they	1
are	1
an	1
abomination:	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
the	1
ossifrage,	1
and	1
the	1
ospray,	1
11:14	1
And	1
the	1
vulture,	1
and	1
the	1
kite	1
after	1
his	1
kind;	1
11:15	1
Every	1
raven	1
after	1
his	1

11:16	1
And	1
the	1
owl,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
hawk,	1
and	1
the	1
cuckow,	1
and	1
the	1
hawk	1
after	1
his	1

11:17	1
And	1
the	1
little	1
owl,	1
and	1
the	1
cormorant,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
owl,	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
swan,	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

eagle,	1
11:19	1
And	1
the	1

the	1

after	1
her	1

and	1
the	1
lapwing,	1
and	1
the	1

	1
11:20	1
All	1
fowls	1
that	1
creep,	1
going	1
upon	1
all	1
four,	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:21	1
Yet	1
these	1
may	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
every	1
flying	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
goeth	1
upon	1
all	1
four,	1
which	1
have	1
legs	1
above	1
their	1

to	1

withal	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
11:22	1
Even	1
these	1
of	1
them	1
ye	1
may	1
eat;	1
the	1
locust	1
after	1
his	1

and	1
the	1
bald	1
locust	1
after	1
his	1

after	1
his	1

	1
11:23	1
But	1
all	1
other	1
flying	1
creeping	1
things,	1
which	1
have	1
four	1
feet,	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
for	1
these	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean:	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1

	1
11:25	1
And	1
whosoever	1

ought	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
them	1

his	1

	1
11:26	1
The	1

of	1
every	1

which	1
divideth	1
the	1

not	1
clovenfooted,	1

you:	1
every	1

them	1
shall	1
be	1

	1
11:27	1
And	1
whatsoever	1

upon	1
his	1

among	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
beasts	1
that	1
go	1
on	1
all	1

those	1
are	1

unto	1
you:	1
whoso	1
toucheth	1
their	1
carcase	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1

	1
11:28	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
beareth	1
the	1

of	1
them	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1

they	1
are	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:29	1
These	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you	1
among	1
the	1
creeping	1
things	1
that	1
creep	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
the	1
weasel,	1
and	1
the	1
mouse,	1
and	1
the	1
tortoise	1
after	1
his	1
kind,	1
11:30	1
And	1
the	1

and	1
the	1
chameleon,	1
and	1
the	1
lizard,	1
and	1
the	1
snail,	1
and	1
the	1
mole.	1
	1
11:31	1
These	1
are	1
unclean	1
to	1
you	1
among	1
all	1
that	1
creep:	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
touch	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1

dead,	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1

	1
11:32	1
And	1
upon	1
whatsoever	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
dead,	1
doth	1
fall,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
whether	1
it	1

any	1
vessel	1
of	1

or	1

whatsoever	1

wherein	1
any	1

unclean	1
until	1
the	1

so	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cleansed.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
every	1
earthen	1
vessel,	1
whereinto	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
falleth,	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
break	1
it.	1
	1
11:34	1
Of	1
all	1
meat	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
eaten,	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
such	1
water	1
cometh	1
shall	1

and	1
all	1

in	1
every	1
such	1
vessel	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
every	1
thing	1
whereupon	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
carcase	1
falleth	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
oven,	1
or	1
ranges	1
for	1
pots,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
down:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
unclean	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:36	1
Nevertheless	1
a	1
fountain	1
or	1
pit,	1
wherein	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
water,	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
toucheth	1
their	1
carcase	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
if	1
any	1

of	1
their	1
carcase	1
fall	1
upon	1
any	1
sowing	1
seed	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
sown,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
11:38	1
But	1
if	1
any	1

be	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
seed,	1
and	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
their	1

fall	1
thereon,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
beast,	1
of	1
which	1
ye	1
may	1
eat,	1
die;	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
carcase	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even.	1
	1
11:40	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1

he	1
also	1
that	1
beareth	1
the	1

it	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1

	1
11:41	1
And	1
every	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
abomination;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
11:42	1
Whatsoever	1
goeth	1
upon	1
the	1

and	1
whatsoever	1

upon	1
all	1
four,	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
hath	1
more	1
feet	1
among	1
all	1
creeping	1
things	1
that	1
creep	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
an	1
abomination.	1
	1
11:43	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
yourselves	1
abominable	1
with	1
any	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
yourselves	1
unclean	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
defiled	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:44	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
defile	1
yourselves	1
with	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
creeping	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:45	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
bringeth	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
be	1
holy,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
11:46	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
moveth	1
in	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
creature	1
that	1
creepeth	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
11:47	1
To	1
make	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
unclean	1
and	1
the	1
clean,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
eaten	1
and	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
eaten.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
12:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
conceived	1
seed,	1
and	1
born	1
a	1
man	1
child:	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
separation	1
for	1
her	1
infirmity	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
foreskin	1
shall	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
then	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
three	1
and	1
thirty	1
days;	1
she	1
shall	1
touch	1
no	1
hallowed	1
thing,	1
nor	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
if	1
she	1
bear	1
a	1
maid	1
child,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
two	1
weeks,	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
separation:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
threescore	1
and	1
six	1
days.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purifying	1
are	1
fulfilled,	1
for	1
a	1
son,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
daughter,	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
pigeon,	1
or	1
a	1
turtledove,	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
12:7	1
Who	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
cleansed	1
from	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
her	1
blood.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
her	1
that	1
hath	1
born	1
a	1
male	1
or	1
a	1
female.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb,	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
two	1
turtles,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons;	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1

and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
a	1

it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
like	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy;	1
then	1
he	1

be	1
brought	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
or	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
the	1

13:3	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
plague	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1

turned	1
white,	1
and	1
the	1

deeper	1
than	1
the	1

shall	1
look	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:4	1
If	1
the	1
bright	1
spot	1
be	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1

and	1
in	1

the	1

and	1
the	1
hair	1
thereof	1
be	1
not	1
turned	1
white;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
shut	1
up	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague	1
seven	1
days:	1
13:5	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
stay,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
spread	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
skin;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
shut	1
him	1
up	1
seven	1
days	1
more:	1
13:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
somewhat	1
dark,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
spread	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean:	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
scab:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
13:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
scab	1
spread	1
much	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
for	1
his	1
cleansing,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
again.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
see	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
scab	1
spreadeth	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
leprosy.	1
	1
13:9	1
When	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
man,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
priest;	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
him:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1

be	1
white	1
in	1
the	1

and	1
it	1

turned	1
the	1

and	1
there	1
be	1
quick	1
raw	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1

13:11	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
leprosy	1
in	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
unclean,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
shut	1
him	1
up:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1

from	1
his	1
head	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
foot,	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
priest	1
looketh;	1
13:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
consider:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
leprosy	1
have	1
covered	1
all	1
his	1

he	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague:	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
turned	1
white:	1
he	1
is	1
clean.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
raw	1
flesh	1
appeareth	1
in	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
raw	1
flesh,	1
and	1
pronounce	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
unclean:	1
for	1
the	1
raw	1
flesh	1
is	1
unclean:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
leprosy.	1
	1
13:16	1
Or	1
if	1
the	1
raw	1

be	1
changed	1
unto	1
white,	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
priest;	1
13:17	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
see	1
him:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
white;	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
pronounce	1
him	1
clean	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
plague:	1
he	1
is	1
clean.	1
	1
13:18	1
The	1

in	1
which,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1

13:20	1
And	1
if,	1
when	1

	1
13:21	1
But	1

	1

Or	1

If	1

And	1

13:44	1
He	1

13:45	1
And	1

All	1

him	1
he	1

of	1
leprosy,	1

unto	1
the	1

13:50	1
And	1
the	1

13:51	1
And	1
he	1

on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
if	1
the	1

	1
13:52	1
He	1

therefore	1
burn	1
that	1

	1

And	1

13:54	1
Then	1
the	1

shall	1
command	1
that	1
they	1
wash	1
the	1
thing	1
wherein	1
the	1
plague	1

and	1
he	1
shall	1
shut	1
it	1
up	1
seven	1
days	1
more:	1
13:55	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
plague,	1
after	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
washed:	1
and,	1

if	1
the	1
plague	1
have	1
not	1
changed	1
his	1

and	1
the	1

thou	1

whether	1
it	1

	1
13:56	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
look,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
plague	1
be	1
somewhat	1
dark	1
after	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
it;	1
then	1
he	1

out	1
of	1
the	1

in	1
any	1

a	1
spreading	1
plague:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
burn	1
that	1
wherein	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
13:58	1
And	1
the	1
garment,	1
either	1

	1
13:59	1
This	1

the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1

	1
14:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
14:2	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
leper	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
cleansing:	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
priest:	1
14:3	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
the	1

shall	1
look,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
leprosy	1
be	1
healed	1
in	1
the	1
leper;	1
14:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
command	1
to	1
take	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
is	1

And	1

14:6	1
As	1
for	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

killed	1
over	1
the	1

water:	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1

	1
14:8	1
And	1
he	1
that	1

	1
14:9	1
But	1
it	1

14:14	1
And	1

	1
14:54	1
This	1

To	1

uncleanness;	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
uncleanness,	1
when	1
they	1
defile	1
my	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
15:32	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
whose	1
seed	1
goeth	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
is	1
defiled	1
therewith;	1
15:33	1
And	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
sick	1
of	1
her	1
flowers,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
lieth	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
when	1
they	1
offered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
died;	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
come	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
within	1
the	1
vail	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
ark;	1
that	1
he	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat.	1
	1
16:3	1
Thus	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
16:4	1
He	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
holy	1
linen	1
coat,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
linen	1
breeches	1
upon	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
girdle,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
mitre	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
attired:	1
these	1
are	1
holy	1
garments;	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
so	1
put	1
them	1
on.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
two	1
kids	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
one	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
his	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
two	1
goats,	1
and	1
present	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
goats;	1
one	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lot	1
for	1
the	1
scapegoat.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
goat	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
LORD's	1
lot	1
fell,	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
16:10	1
But	1
the	1
goat,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
scapegoat,	1
shall	1
be	1
presented	1
alive	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
scapegoat	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
the	1
bullock	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
himself:	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
censer	1
full	1
of	1
burning	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
full	1
of	1
sweet	1
incense	1
beaten	1
small,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
within	1
the	1
vail:	1
16:13	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
the	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
incense	1
may	1
cover	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
die	1
not:	1
16:14	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
eastward;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat	1
shall	1
he	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
seven	1
times.	1
	1
16:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
kill	1
the	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
that	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
bring	1
his	1
blood	1
within	1
the	1
vail,	1
and	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
blood	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
mercy	1
seat:	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
transgressions	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
remaineth	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
in	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
until	1
he	1
come	1
out,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
bullock,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
goat,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it,	1
and	1
hallow	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
reconciling	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
live	1
goat:	1
16:21	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
lay	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
live	1
goat,	1
and	1
confess	1
over	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
transgressions	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins,	1
putting	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
goat,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
fit	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
goat	1
shall	1
bear	1
upon	1
him	1
all	1
their	1
iniquities	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
not	1
inhabited:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
goat	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
shall	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
linen	1
garments,	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
there:	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
with	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
offer	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
shall	1
he	1
burn	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
goat	1
for	1
the	1
scapegoat	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
bullock	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
goat	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering,	1
whose	1
blood	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
to	1
make	1
atonement	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
shall	1
one	1
carry	1
forth	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
burn	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
their	1
skins,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh,	1
and	1
their	1
dung.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
them	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
16:29	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
you:	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
and	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
at	1
all,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you:	1
16:30	1
For	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
clean	1
from	1
all	1
your	1
sins	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:31	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
the	1
priest,	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
anoint,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
to	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
in	1
his	1

and	1
shall	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
even	1
the	1
holy	1
garments:	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1

and	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
everlasting	1
statute	1
unto	1
you,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
once	1
a	1
year.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
17:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them;	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
17:3	1
What	1
man	1
soever	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
killeth	1
an	1
ox,	1
or	1
lamb,	1
or	1
goat,	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
or	1
that	1
killeth	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
17:4	1
And	1
bringeth	1
it	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
that	1
man;	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
blood;	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
17:5	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
may	1
bring	1
their	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field,	1
even	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
offer	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
devils,	1
after	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring.	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
unto	1
them	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
which	1

among	1
you,	1
that	1
offereth	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
sacrifice,	1
17:9	1
And	1
bringeth	1
it	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
offer	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
even	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
blood;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
blood,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
17:11	1
For	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
your	1
souls:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
maketh	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
No	1
soul	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
eat	1
blood,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you	1
eat	1
blood.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
hunteth	1
and	1
catcheth	1
any	1
beast	1
or	1
fowl	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
eaten;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof,	1
and	1
cover	1
it	1
with	1
dust.	1
	1
17:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
all	1
flesh;	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
thereof:	1
therefore	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
flesh:	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
thereof:	1
whosoever	1
eateth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
every	1
soul	1
that	1
eateth	1
that	1
which	1
died	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn	1
with	1
beasts,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
he	1
shall	1
both	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
himself	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even:	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
17:16	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
wash	1
them	1
not,	1
nor	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
18:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
18:3	1
After	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
dwelt,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1

and	1
after	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you,	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
do:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
ordinances.	1
	1
18:4	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
to	1
walk	1
therein:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
18:5	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
my	1
judgments:	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:6	1
None	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
approach	1
to	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1

The	1

	1
18:8	1

	1
18:11	1
The	1

of	1
thy	1

18:12	1
Thou	1

	1
18:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1

for	1
she	1

	1
18:14	1
Thou	1

of	1
thy	1

thou	1

	1
18:15	1
Thou	1

Thou	1

	1
18:17	1
Thou	1

neither	1

take	1
her	1
son's	1

daughter,	1
to	1
uncover	1
her	1

for	1
they	1

wickedness.	1
	1
18:18	1
Neither	1

	1
18:20	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lie	1
carnally	1
with	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
to	1
defile	1
thyself	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
let	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
pass	1

the	1
fire	1
to	1
Molech,	1
neither	1

the	1
name	1
of	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:22	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
lie	1
with	1
mankind,	1
as	1
with	1
womankind:	1
it	1
is	1
abomination.	1
	1
18:23	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
lie	1
with	1
any	1
beast	1
to	1

therewith:	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
woman	1
stand	1
before	1
a	1
beast	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
thereto:	1
it	1
is	1
confusion.	1
	1
18:24	1
Defile	1
not	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
the	1
nations	1
are	1
defiled	1
which	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
you:	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
defiled:	1
therefore	1
I	1
do	1
visit	1
the	1
iniquity	1
thereof	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
itself	1
vomiteth	1
out	1
her	1
inhabitants.	1
	1
18:26	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
commit	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
abominations;	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
nation,	1
nor	1
any	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
you:	1
18:27	1
(For	1
all	1
these	1
abominations	1
have	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
done,	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
defiled;)	1
18:28	1
That	1
the	1
land	1
spue	1
not	1
you	1
out	1
also,	1
when	1
ye	1
defile	1
it,	1
as	1
it	1
spued	1
out	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
18:29	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
commit	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
abominations,	1
even	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
commit	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
18:30	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinance,	1
that	1
ye	1
commit	1
not	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
abominable	1
customs,	1
which	1
were	1
committed	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
defile	1
not	1
yourselves	1
therein:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
19:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
19:3	1
Ye	1
shall	1
fear	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:4	1
Turn	1
ye	1
not	1
unto	1
idols,	1
nor	1
make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
molten	1
gods:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
it	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
19:6	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
ye	1
offer	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow:	1
and	1
if	1
ought	1
remain	1
until	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
in	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
it	1
is	1
abominable;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted.	1
	1
19:8	1
Therefore	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
eateth	1
it	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
profaned	1
the	1
hallowed	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1

	1
19:9	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
reap	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
your	1
land,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
wholly	1
reap	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1

neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
gather	1
the	1

	1
19:10	1
And	1
thou	1

not	1
glean	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
gather	1
every	1
grape	1
of	1
thy	1

thou	1

I	1

the	1

	1
19:11	1
Ye	1

neither	1
deal	1
falsely,	1
neither	1
lie	1
one	1

another.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1

by	1
my	1

falsely,	1
neither	1

	1
19:13	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
defraud	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
neither	1
rob	1
him:	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
hired	1
shall	1
not	1
abide	1
with	1
thee	1
all	1
night	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
19:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
curse	1
the	1
deaf,	1
nor	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
blind,	1
but	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:15	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
judgment:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
respect	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
nor	1
honor	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
mighty:	1
but	1
in	1
righteousness	1
shalt	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
neighbour.	1
	1
19:16	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
talebearer	1
among	1
thy	1
people:	1
neither	1

blood	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour;	1
I	1
am	1

LORD.	1
	1
19:17	1
Thou	1

thy	1
brother	1

in	1
any	1
wise	1
rebuke	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
not	1
suffer	1
sin	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
19:18	1
Thou	1

not	1
avenge,	1
nor	1
bear	1
any	1
grudge	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1

I	1

	1
19:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes.	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1

thy	1
field	1
with	1
mingled	1
seed:	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
garment	1
mingled	1
of	1
linen	1
and	1
woollen	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
whosoever	1
lieth	1
carnally	1
with	1
a	1
woman,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
betrothed	1
to	1
an	1
husband,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
redeemed,	1
nor	1
freedom	1
given	1
her;	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
scourged;	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
free.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
his	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
even	1
a	1
ram	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
his	1
sin	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done:	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
planted	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
trees	1
for	1
food,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
count	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
as	1
uncircumcised:	1
three	1
years	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
uncircumcised	1
unto	1
you:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
eaten	1
of.	1
	1
19:24	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
all	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
withal.	1
	1
19:25	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
yield	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:26	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
any	1
thing	1
with	1
the	1
blood:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
use	1
enchantment,	1
nor	1
observe	1
times.	1
	1
19:27	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
round	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
your	1
heads,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
mar	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1
beard.	1
	1
19:28	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
cuttings	1
in	1
your	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
nor	1
print	1
any	1
marks	1
upon	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:29	1
Do	1
not	1
prostitute	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
whore;	1
lest	1
the	1
land	1
fall	1
to	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
become	1
full	1
of	1
wickedness.	1
	1
19:30	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
reverence	1
my	1
sanctuary:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:31	1
Regard	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
neither	1
seek	1
after	1
wizards,	1
to	1
be	1
defiled	1
by	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:32	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
rise	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
hoary	1
head,	1
and	1
honour	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
sojourn	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
vex	1
him.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
one	1
born	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
thyself;	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
19:35	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
judgment,	1
in	1
meteyard,	1
in	1
weight,	1
or	1
in	1
measure.	1
	1
19:36	1
Just	1
balances,	1
just	1
weights,	1
a	1
just	1
ephah,	1
and	1
a	1
just	1
hin,	1
shall	1
ye	1
have:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
19:37	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
observe	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
20:2	1
Again,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
sojourn	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
giveth	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech;	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech,	1
to	1
defile	1
my	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
to	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
do	1
any	1
ways	1
hide	1
their	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
giveth	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
unto	1
Molech,	1
and	1
kill	1
him	1
not:	1
20:5	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
him,	1
to	1
commit	1
whoredom	1
with	1
Molech,	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
turneth	1
after	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
after	1
wizards,	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
that	1
soul,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
20:7	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
holy:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
sanctify	1
you.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
curseth	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
he	1
hath	1
cursed	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother;	1
his	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
with	1
another	1
man's	1
wife,	1
even	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
wife,	1
the	1
adulterer	1
and	1
the	1
adulteress	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
lieth	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
wife	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
father's	1
nakedness:	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
they	1
have	1
wrought	1
confusion;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
lie	1
with	1
mankind,	1
as	1
he	1
lieth	1
with	1
a	1
woman,	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
committed	1
an	1
abomination:	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
it	1
is	1
wickedness:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
they;	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
wickedness	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
a	1
beast,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
slay	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
approach	1
unto	1
any	1
beast,	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
thereto,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
beast:	1
they	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death;	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
his	1
sister,	1
his	1
father's	1
daughter,	1
or	1
his	1
mother's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
she	1
see	1
his	1
nakedness;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
wicked	1
thing;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
their	1
people:	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
sister's	1
nakedness;	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
iniquity.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
her	1
sickness,	1
and	1
shall	1
uncover	1
her	1
nakedness;	1
he	1
hath	1
discovered	1
her	1
fountain,	1
and	1
she	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
her	1
blood:	1
and	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
their	1
people.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
uncover	1
the	1
nakedness	1
of	1
thy	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
nor	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
sister:	1
for	1
he	1
uncovereth	1
his	1
near	1
kin:	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
his	1
uncle's	1
wife,	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
uncle's	1
nakedness:	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
sin;	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
childless.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
his	1
brother's	1
wife,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
he	1
hath	1
uncovered	1
his	1
brother's	1
nakedness;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
childless.	1
	1
20:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
all	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
that	1
the	1
land,	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
spue	1
you	1
not	1
out.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
which	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
you:	1
for	1
they	1
committed	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
abhorred	1
them.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
inherit	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
separated	1
you	1
from	1
other	1
people.	1
	1
20:25	1
Ye	1
shall	1
therefore	1
put	1
difference	1
between	1
clean	1
beasts	1
and	1
unclean,	1
and	1
between	1
unclean	1
fowls	1
and	1
clean:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
your	1
souls	1
abominable	1
by	1
beast,	1
or	1
by	1
fowl,	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
living	1
thing	1
that	1
creepeth	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
separated	1
from	1
you	1
as	1
unclean.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
am	1
holy,	1
and	1
have	1
severed	1
you	1
from	1
other	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
20:27	1
A	1
man	1
also	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
wizard,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
they	1
shall	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones:	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
There	1
shall	1
none	1
be	1
defiled	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
21:2	1
But	1
for	1
his	1
kin,	1
that	1
is	1
near	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
for	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
a	1
virgin,	1
that	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him,	1
which	1
hath	1
had	1
no	1
husband;	1
for	1
her	1
may	1
he	1
be	1
defiled.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
defile	1
himself,	1
being	1
a	1
chief	1
man	1
among	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
profane	1
himself.	1
	1
21:5	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
baldness	1
upon	1
their	1
head,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
shave	1
off	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
their	1
beard,	1
nor	1
make	1
any	1
cuttings	1
in	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
21:6	1
They	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1

of	1
their	1

for	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
their	1
God,	1
they	1
do	1
offer:	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
21:7	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
whore,	1
or	1
profane;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
a	1
woman	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:8	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sanctify	1
him	1
therefore;	1
for	1
he	1
offereth	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
thy	1
God:	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
sanctify	1
you,	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
any	1
priest,	1
if	1
she	1
profane	1
herself	1
by	1
playing	1
the	1
whore,	1
she	1
profaneth	1
her	1
father:	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
upon	1
whose	1
head	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
was	1
poured,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
consecrated	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
garments,	1
shall	1
not	1
uncover	1
his	1
head,	1
nor	1
rend	1
his	1
clothes;	1
21:11	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
any	1
dead	1
body,	1
nor	1
defile	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
mother;	1
21:12	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
nor	1
profane	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
his	1
God;	1
for	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
the	1
anointing	1
oil	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
him:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
in	1
her	1
virginity.	1
	1
21:14	1
A	1
widow,	1
or	1
a	1
divorced	1
woman,	1
or	1
profane,	1
or	1
an	1
harlot,	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
take:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
a	1
virgin	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
people	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
21:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
profane	1
his	1
seed	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
him.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
21:17	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
thy	1
seed	1
in	1
their	1
generations	1
that	1
hath	1
any	1
blemish,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
approach	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:18	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
man	1
he	1
be	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
approach:	1
a	1
blind	1
man,	1
or	1
a	1
lame,	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
flat	1
nose,	1
or	1
any	1
thing	1
superfluous,	1
21:19	1
Or	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
brokenfooted,	1
or	1
brokenhanded,	1
21:20	1
Or	1
crookbackt,	1
or	1
a	1
dwarf,	1
or	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
his	1
eye,	1
or	1
be	1
scurvy,	1
or	1
scabbed,	1
or	1
hath	1
his	1
stones	1
broken;	1
21:21	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire:	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
21:22	1
He	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
his	1
God,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
holy,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
holy.	1
	1
21:23	1
Only	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
vail,	1
nor	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
altar,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish;	1
that	1
he	1
profane	1
not	1
my	1
sanctuaries:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
that	1
they	1
separate	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
profane	1
not	1
my	1
holy	1
name	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
hallow	1
unto	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:3	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
seed	1
among	1
your	1
generations,	1
that	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
hallow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
having	1
his	1
uncleanness	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
my	1
presence:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:4	1
What	1
man	1
soever	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron	1
is	1
a	1
leper,	1
or	1
hath	1
a	1
running	1
issue;	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
clean.	1
And	1
whoso	1
toucheth	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
unclean	1
by	1
the	1
dead,	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
seed	1
goeth	1
from	1
him;	1
22:5	1
Or	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
any	1
creeping	1
thing,	1
whereby	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
unclean,	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
uncleanness,	1
whatsoever	1
uncleanness	1
he	1
hath;	1
22:6	1
The	1
soul	1
which	1
hath	1
touched	1
any	1
such	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
unless	1
he	1
wash	1
his	1
flesh	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
down,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
shall	1
afterward	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
food.	1
	1
22:8	1
That	1
which	1
dieth	1
of	1
itself,	1
or	1
is	1
torn	1
with	1
beasts,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
to	1
defile	1
himself	1
therewith;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:9	1
They	1
shall	1
therefore	1
keep	1
mine	1
ordinance,	1
lest	1
they	1
bear	1
sin	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
die	1
therefore,	1
if	1
they	1
profane	1
it:	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
22:10	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing:	1
a	1
sojourner	1
of	1
the	1
priest,	1
or	1
an	1
hired	1
servant,	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing.	1
	1
22:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
priest	1
buy	1
any	1
soul	1
with	1
his	1
money,	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
his	1
house:	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
meat.	1
	1
22:12	1
If	1
the	1
priest's	1
daughter	1
also	1
be	1
married	1
unto	1
a	1
stranger,	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things.	1
	1
22:13	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
priest's	1
daughter	1
be	1
a	1
widow,	1
or	1
divorced,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
child,	1
and	1
is	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
father's	1
house,	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
youth,	1
she	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
meat:	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
stranger	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
thing	1
unwittingly,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
put	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
priest	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
thing.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
profane	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
22:16	1
Or	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
trespass,	1
when	1
they	1
eat	1
their	1
holy	1
things:	1
for	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
sanctify	1
them.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:18	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whatsoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
will	1
offer	1
his	1
oblation	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
vows,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
freewill	1
offerings,	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering;	1
22:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will	1
a	1
male	1
without	1
blemish,	1
of	1
the	1
beeves,	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
goats.	1
	1
22:20	1
But	1
whatsoever	1
hath	1
a	1
blemish,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
not	1
offer:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
acceptable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
whosoever	1
offereth	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
accomplish	1
his	1
vow,	1
or	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering	1
in	1
beeves	1
or	1
sheep,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
perfect	1
to	1
be	1
accepted;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
blemish	1
therein.	1
	1
22:22	1
Blind,	1
or	1
broken,	1
or	1
maimed,	1
or	1
having	1
a	1
wen,	1
or	1
scurvy,	1
or	1
scabbed,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
these	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
make	1
an	1
offering	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:23	1
Either	1
a	1
bullock	1
or	1
a	1
lamb	1
that	1
hath	1
any	1
thing	1
superfluous	1
or	1
lacking	1
in	1
his	1
parts,	1
that	1
mayest	1
thou	1
offer	1
for	1
a	1
freewill	1

but	1
for	1
a	1
vow	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted.	1
	1
22:24	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
bruised,	1
or	1
crushed,	1
or	1
broken,	1
or	1
cut;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
any	1
offering	1
thereof	1
in	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
22:25	1
Neither	1
from	1
a	1
stranger's	1
hand	1
shall	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
these;	1
because	1
their	1

in	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
22:27	1
When	1
a	1
bullock,	1
or	1
a	1
sheep,	1
or	1
a	1
goat,	1
is	1
brought	1
forth,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
days	1
under	1
the	1
dam;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
and	1
thenceforth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
accepted	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
cow,	1
or	1
ewe,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
kill	1
it	1
and	1
her	1
young	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
will	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
offer	1
it	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
eaten	1
up;	1
ye	1
shall	1
leave	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
morrow:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:31	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:32	1
Neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
hallowed	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
hallow	1
you,	1
22:33	1
That	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Concerning	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
to	1
be	1
holy	1
convocations,	1
even	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
feasts.	1
	1
23:3	1
Six	1
days	1
shall	1
work	1
be	1
done:	1
but	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation;	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
therein:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
dwellings.	1
	1
23:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
holy	1
convocations,	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
proclaim	1
in	1
their	1
seasons.	1
	1
23:5	1
In	1
the	1
fourteenth	1

In	1

Speak	1

the	1

	1

for	1

	1
23:21	1
And	1
ye	1

	1
23:22	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
reap	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
your	1
land,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
clean	1
riddance	1
of	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
thy	1

when	1
thou	1
reapest,	1
neither	1

thou	1
gather	1
any	1

thy	1
harvest:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
leave	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
stranger:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1

your	1
God.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:24	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1

month,	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
month,	1
shall	1

have	1
a	1

a	1
memorial	1
of	1
blowing	1
of	1
trumpets,	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation.	1
	1
23:25	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
servile	1
work	1
therein:	1
but	1
ye	1

offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:27	1
Also	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
seventh	1
month	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
atonement:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
holy	1
convocation	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1
souls,	1
and	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
work	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1

of	1
atonement,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
23:29	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
soul	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
afflicted	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
soul	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
doeth	1
any	1
work	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
the	1
same	1
soul	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
23:31	1
Ye	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
work:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1

for	1

in	1
all	1
your	1

	1
23:32	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
afflict	1
your	1

in	1
the	1
ninth	1

of	1
the	1

at	1

from	1
even	1
unto	1

shall	1
ye	1
celebrate	1
your	1

	1
23:33	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
23:34	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1

	1
23:35	1
On	1

holy	1
convocation:	1
ye	1

	1
23:36	1
Seven	1
days	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1

	1
23:37	1
These	1
are	1
the	1

	1
23:39	1
Also	1

	1
23:41	1
And	1
ye	1

seven	1

	1
It	1

	1
23:42	1
Ye	1

seven	1
days;	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
Israelites	1
born	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths:	1
23:43	1
That	1
your	1
generations	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths,	1
when	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
23:44	1
And	1
Moses	1
declared	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
24:2	1
Command	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
thee	1
pure	1
oil	1
olive	1
beaten	1
for	1
the	1
light,	1
to	1
cause	1
the	1
lamps	1
to	1
burn	1
continually.	1
	1
24:3	1
Without	1
the	1
vail	1
of	1
the	1
testimony,	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
shall	1
Aaron	1
order	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
evening	1
unto	1
the	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
24:4	1
He	1
shall	1
order	1
the	1
lamps	1
upon	1
the	1
pure	1
candlestick	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
bake	1
twelve	1
cakes	1
thereof:	1
two	1
tenth	1
deals	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
one	1
cake.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
rows,	1
six	1
on	1
a	1
row,	1
upon	1
the	1
pure	1
table	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
put	1
pure	1
frankincense	1
upon	1
each	1
row,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
bread	1
for	1
a	1
memorial,	1
even	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:8	1
Every	1
sabbath	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
Aaron's	1
and	1
his	1
sons';	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
by	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
Israelitish	1
woman,	1
whose	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
went	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
this	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
Israelitish	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Israel	1
strove	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
camp;	1
24:11	1
And	1
the	1
Israelitish	1
woman's	1
son	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
cursed.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
(and	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Shelomith,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Dibri,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan:)	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
ward,	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
might	1
be	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
24:14	1
Bring	1
forth	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
cursed	1
without	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
curseth	1
his	1
God	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
blasphemeth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
certainly	1
stone	1
him:	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
stranger,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
when	1
he	1
blasphemeth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
beast	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
good;	1
beast	1
for	1
beast.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
cause	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him;	1
24:20	1
Breach	1
for	1
breach,	1
eye	1
for	1
eye,	1
tooth	1
for	1
tooth:	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
caused	1
a	1
blemish	1
in	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
beast,	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
24:22	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
manner	1
of	1
law,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
as	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
country:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
cursed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
saying,	1
25:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
you,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
keep	1
a	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
25:3	1
Six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sow	1
thy	1
field,	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prune	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof;	1
25:4	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sabbath	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
the	1
land,	1
a	1
sabbath	1
for	1
the	1
LORD:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
neither	1
sow	1
thy	1
field,	1
nor	1
prune	1
thy	1
vineyard.	1
	1
25:5	1
That	1
which	1
groweth	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
accord	1
of	1
thy	1
harvest	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
reap,	1
neither	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
thy	1
vine	1
undressed:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
year	1
of	1
rest	1
unto	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
the	1
sabbath	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
meat	1
for	1
you;	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
maid,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
hired	1
servant,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
for	1
thy	1
cattle,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
thy	1
land,	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof	1
be	1
meat.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
number	1
seven	1
sabbaths	1
of	1
years	1
unto	1
thee,	1
seven	1
times	1
seven	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
sabbaths	1
of	1
years	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
forty	1
and	1
nine	1
years.	1
	1
25:9	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
cause	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
jubile	1
to	1
sound	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
atonement	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
trumpet	1
sound	1
throughout	1
all	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hallow	1
the	1
fiftieth	1
year,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
liberty	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
jubile	1
unto	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
possession,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
family.	1
	1
25:11	1
A	1
jubile	1
shall	1
that	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
sow,	1
neither	1
reap	1
that	1
which	1
groweth	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
it,	1
nor	1
gather	1
the	1
grapes	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
thy	1
vine	1
undressed.	1
	1
25:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
jubile;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
you:	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
increase	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
25:13	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
this	1
jubile	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
sell	1
ought	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
or	1
buyest	1
ought	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour's	1
hand,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
oppress	1
one	1
another:	1
25:15	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
after	1
the	1
jubile	1
thou	1
shalt	1
buy	1
of	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
he	1
shall	1
sell	1
unto	1
thee:	1
25:16	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
increase	1
the	1
price	1
thereof,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fewness	1
of	1
years	1
thou	1
shalt	1
diminish	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
it:	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
fruits	1
doth	1
he	1
sell	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
25:17	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
therefore	1
oppress	1
one	1
another;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God:for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
25:18	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
fill,	1
and	1
dwell	1
therein	1
in	1
safety.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat	1
the	1
seventh	1
year?	1
behold,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
sow,	1
nor	1
gather	1
in	1
our	1
increase:	1
25:21	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
command	1
my	1
blessing	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
for	1
three	1
years.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
the	1
eighth	1
year,	1
and	1
eat	1
yet	1
of	1
old	1
fruit	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
year;	1
until	1
her	1
fruits	1
come	1
in	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
store.	1
	1
25:23	1
The	1
land	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sold	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
mine,	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
strangers	1
and	1
sojourners	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
possession	1
ye	1
shall	1
grant	1
a	1
redemption	1
for	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
25:25	1
If	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
hath	1
sold	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
kin	1
come	1
to	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
redeem	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
brother	1
sold.	1
	1
25:26	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
have	1
none	1
to	1
redeem	1
it,	1
and	1
himself	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
redeem	1
it;	1
25:27	1
Then	1
let	1
him	1
count	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
sale	1
thereof,	1
and	1
restore	1
the	1
overplus	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
sold	1
it;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:28	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
sold	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
bought	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
jubile	1
it	1
shall	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
25:29	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sell	1
a	1
dwelling	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
walled	1
city,	1
then	1
he	1
may	1
redeem	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
after	1
it	1
is	1
sold;	1
within	1
a	1
full	1
year	1
may	1
he	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
year,	1
then	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
walled	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bought	1
it	1
throughout	1
his	1
generations:	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:31	1
But	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
wall	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
as	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
country:	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
redeemed,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:32	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
their	1
possession,	1
may	1
the	1
Levites	1
redeem	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
	1
25:33	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
then	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
sold,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
for	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
are	1
their	1
possession	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
25:34	1
But	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
suburbs	1
of	1
their	1
cities	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
sold;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
their	1
perpetual	1
possession.	1
	1
25:35	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
fallen	1
in	1
decay	1
with	1
thee;	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
relieve	1
him:	1
yea,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
a	1
sojourner;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
live	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:36	1
Take	1
thou	1
no	1
usury	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
increase:	1
but	1
fear	1
thy	1
God;	1
that	1
thy	1
brother	1
may	1
live	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
25:37	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
thy	1
money	1
upon	1
usury,	1
nor	1
lend	1
him	1
thy	1
victuals	1
for	1
increase.	1
	1
25:38	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
25:39	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
by	1
thee	1
be	1
waxen	1
poor,	1
and	1
be	1
sold	1
unto	1
thee;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
compel	1
him	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
bondservant:	1
25:40	1
But	1
as	1
an	1
hired	1
servant,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sojourner,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile.	1
	1
25:41	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
depart	1
from	1
thee,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
family,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
fathers	1
shall	1
he	1
return.	1
	1
25:42	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
servants,	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
sold	1
as	1
bondmen.	1
	1
25:43	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
rule	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
rigour;	1
but	1
shalt	1
fear	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
25:44	1
Both	1
thy	1
bondmen,	1
and	1
thy	1
bondmaids,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have,	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
you;	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
buy	1
bondmen	1
and	1
bondmaids.	1
	1
25:45	1
Moreover	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
do	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
buy,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
families	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
you,	1
which	1
they	1
begat	1
in	1
your	1
land:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
possession.	1
	1
25:46	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
as	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
your	1
children	1
after	1
you,	1
to	1
inherit	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
possession;	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
bondmen	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
over	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
rule	1
one	1
over	1
another	1
with	1
rigour.	1
	1
25:47	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
sojourner	1
or	1
stranger	1
wax	1
rich	1
by	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
brother	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
by	1
him	1
wax	1
poor,	1
and	1
sell	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
or	1
sojourner	1
by	1
thee,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
the	1
stranger's	1
family:	1
25:48	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
sold	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
redeemed	1
again;	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
may	1
redeem	1
him:	1
25:49	1
Either	1
his	1
uncle,	1
or	1
his	1
uncle's	1
son,	1
may	1
redeem	1
him,	1
or	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
nigh	1
of	1
kin	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
may	1
redeem	1
him;	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
able,	1
he	1
may	1
redeem	1
himself.	1
	1
25:50	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
reckon	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
bought	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sold	1
to	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile:	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
sale	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
years,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
an	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
25:51	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
yet	1
many	1
years	1
behind,	1
according	1
unto	1
them	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
again	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
redemption	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bought	1
for.	1
	1
25:52	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
remain	1
but	1
few	1
years	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
count	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
according	1
unto	1
his	1
years	1
shall	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
redemption.	1
	1
25:53	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
yearly	1
hired	1
servant	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
shall	1
not	1
rule	1
with	1
rigour	1
over	1
him	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
25:54	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed	1
in	1
these	1
years,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
both	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
children	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
25:55	1
For	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
servants;	1
they	1
are	1
my	1
servants	1
whom	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
26:1	1
Ye	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
no	1
idols	1
nor	1
graven	1
image,	1
neither	1
rear	1
you	1
up	1
a	1
standing	1
image,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
set	1
up	1
any	1
image	1
of	1
stone	1
in	1
your	1
land,	1
to	1
bow	1
down	1
unto	1
it:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
26:2	1
Ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
my	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
reverence	1
my	1
sanctuary:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:3	1
If	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
26:4	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
rain	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
yield	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
yield	1
their	1
fruit.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
your	1
threshing	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
the	1
vintage,	1
and	1
the	1
vintage	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
the	1
sowing	1
time:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
bread	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
and	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
land	1
safely.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
afraid:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rid	1
evil	1
beasts	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sword	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
26:7	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
chase	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
before	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:8	1
And	1
five	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
chase	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
put	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
flight:	1
and	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
fall	1
before	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:9	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
respect	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
fruitful,	1
and	1
multiply	1
you,	1
and	1
establish	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
26:10	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
old	1
store,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
old	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
new.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
tabernacle	1
among	1
you:	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
not	1
abhor	1
you.	1
	1
26:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
26:13	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
their	1
bondmen;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
your	1
yoke,	1
and	1
made	1
you	1
go	1
upright.	1
	1
26:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
commandments;	1
26:15	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
despise	1
my	1
statutes,	1
or	1
if	1
your	1
soul	1
abhor	1
my	1
judgments,	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
commandments,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
break	1
my	1
covenant:	1
26:16	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
unto	1
you;	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
appoint	1
over	1
you	1
terror,	1
consumption,	1
and	1
the	1
burning	1
ague,	1
that	1
shall	1
consume	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
cause	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
sow	1
your	1
seed	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
eat	1
it.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
before	1
your	1
enemies:	1
they	1
that	1
hate	1
you	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth	1
you.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
power;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
heaven	1
as	1
iron,	1
and	1
your	1
earth	1
as	1
brass:	1
26:20	1
And	1
your	1
strength	1
shall	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
your	1
land	1
shall	1
not	1
yield	1
her	1
increase,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
yield	1
their	1
fruits.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
plagues	1
upon	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:22	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
send	1
wild	1
beasts	1
among	1
you,	1
which	1
shall	1
rob	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
destroy	1
your	1
cattle,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
few	1
in	1
number;	1
and	1
your	1
high	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate.	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
reformed	1
by	1
me	1
by	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
will	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:24	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
yet	1
seven	1
times	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
a	1
sword	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
shall	1
avenge	1
the	1
quarrel	1
of	1
my	1
covenant:	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
within	1
your	1
cities,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
pestilence	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
26:26	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
broken	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
your	1
bread,	1
ten	1
women	1
shall	1
bake	1
your	1
bread	1
in	1
one	1
oven,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
your	1
bread	1
again	1
by	1
weight:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:28	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
walk	1
contrary	1
unto	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
fury;	1
and	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
seven	1
times	1
for	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
ye	1
eat.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
your	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
your	1
images,	1
and	1
cast	1
your	1
carcases	1
upon	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
your	1
idols,	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
abhor	1
you.	1
	1
26:31	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
cities	1
waste,	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
sanctuaries	1
unto	1
desolation,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smell	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
your	1
sweet	1
odours.	1
	1
26:32	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
desolation:	1
and	1
your	1
enemies	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished	1
at	1
it.	1
	1
26:33	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
you	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
will	1
draw	1
out	1
a	1
sword	1
after	1
you:	1
and	1
your	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
your	1
cities	1
waste.	1
	1
26:34	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lieth	1
desolate,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
enemies'	1
land;	1
even	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
rest,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths.	1
	1
26:35	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lieth	1
desolate	1
it	1
shall	1
rest;	1
because	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
rest	1
in	1
your	1
sabbaths,	1
when	1
ye	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
26:36	1
And	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
alive	1
of	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
faintness	1
into	1
their	1
hearts	1
in	1
the	1
lands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
shaken	1
leaf	1
shall	1
chase	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
flee,	1
as	1
fleeing	1
from	1
a	1
sword;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth.	1
	1
26:37	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
one	1
upon	1
another,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
before	1
a	1
sword,	1
when	1
none	1
pursueth:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
26:38	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
perish	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
shall	1
eat	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
26:39	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
pine	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
iniquity	1
in	1
your	1
enemies'	1
lands;	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
shall	1
they	1
pine	1
away	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
26:40	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
confess	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
with	1
their	1
trespass	1
which	1
they	1
trespassed	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
they	1
have	1
walked	1
contrary	1
unto	1
me;	1
26:41	1
And	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
walked	1
contrary	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies;	1
if	1
then	1
their	1
uncircumcised	1
hearts	1
be	1
humbled,	1
and	1
they	1
then	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
26:42	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
also	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abraham	1
will	1
I	1
remember;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
26:43	1
The	1
land	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
enjoy	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
while	1
she	1
lieth	1
desolate	1
without	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
accept	1
of	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
because,	1
even	1
because	1
they	1
despised	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
soul	1
abhorred	1
my	1
statutes.	1
	1
26:44	1
And	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
away,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
abhor	1
them,	1
to	1
destroy	1
them	1
utterly,	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
26:45	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
remember	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
their	1
ancestors,	1
whom	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
their	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
26:46	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
and	1
laws,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
27:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
make	1
a	1
singular	1
vow,	1
the	1
persons	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
sixty	1
years	1
old,	1
even	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
female,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
thirty	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
twenty	1
years	1
old,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
twenty	1
shekels,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
ten	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
a	1
month	1
old	1
even	1
unto	1
five	1
years	1
old,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
male	1
five	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
three	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
sixty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
male,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
fifteen	1
shekels,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
female	1
ten	1
shekels.	1
	1
27:8	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
value	1
him;	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability	1
that	1
vowed	1
shall	1
the	1
priest	1
value	1
him.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
beast,	1
whereof	1
men	1
bring	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
giveth	1
of	1
such	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
27:10	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
alter	1
it,	1
nor	1
change	1
it,	1
a	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
bad,	1
or	1
a	1
bad	1
for	1
a	1
good:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
at	1
all	1
change	1
beast	1
for	1
beast,	1
then	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
exchange	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
any	1
unclean	1
beast,	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
present	1
the	1
beast	1
before	1
the	1
priest:	1
27:12	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
value	1
it,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad:	1
as	1
thou	1
valuest	1
it,	1
who	1
art	1
the	1
priest,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be.	1
	1
27:13	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof	1
unto	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
estimate	1
it,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad:	1
as	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
estimate	1
it,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
stand.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
sanctified	1
it	1
will	1
redeem	1
his	1
house,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
then	1
thy	1
estimation	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
seed	1
thereof:	1
an	1
homer	1
of	1
barley	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
valued	1
at	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
27:17	1
If	1
he	1
sanctify	1
his	1
field	1
from	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
jubile,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
estimation	1
it	1
shall	1
stand.	1
	1
27:18	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
sanctify	1
his	1
field	1
after	1
the	1
jubile,	1
then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
reckon	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
remain,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
abated	1
from	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:19	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
sanctified	1
the	1
field	1
will	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation	1
unto	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
assured	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
redeem	1
the	1
field,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
sold	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
redeemed	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
the	1
field,	1
when	1
it	1
goeth	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
jubile,	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
a	1
field	1
devoted;	1
the	1
possession	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
priest's.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sanctify	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
bought,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
his	1
possession;	1
27:23	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
reckon	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
thy	1
estimation,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
thine	1
estimation	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
as	1
a	1
holy	1
thing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:24	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
jubile	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
bought,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
did	1
belong.	1
	1
27:25	1
And	1
all	1
thy	1
estimations	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
twenty	1
gerahs	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
shekel.	1
	1
27:26	1
Only	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's	1
firstling,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
sanctify	1
it;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
ox,	1
or	1
sheep:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
27:27	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
beast,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
redeem	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
estimation,	1
and	1
shall	1
add	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
thereto:	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
redeemed,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
estimation.	1
	1
27:28	1
Notwithstanding	1
no	1
devoted	1
thing,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
devote	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
both	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
beast,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
his	1
possession,	1
shall	1
be	1
sold	1
or	1
redeemed:	1
every	1
devoted	1
thing	1
is	1
most	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:29	1
None	1
devoted,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
devoted	1
of	1
men,	1
shall	1
be	1
redeemed;	1
but	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
whether	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
tree,	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's:	1
it	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
redeem	1
ought	1
of	1
his	1
tithes,	1
he	1
shall	1
add	1
thereto	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
concerning	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
the	1
herd,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
even	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
passeth	1
under	1
the	1
rod,	1
the	1
tenth	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
27:33	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
search	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
change	1
it:	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
change	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
then	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
change	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
holy;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
redeemed.	1
	1
27:34	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
mount	1

From	1

and	1

all	1
that	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
war	1
in	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
and	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
number	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
armies.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
with	1
you	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
every	1
tribe;	1
every	1
one	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1

	1
1:5	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1

the	1

that	1
shall	1
stand	1
with	1
you:	1

	1
1:17	1
And	1
Moses	1

And	1
they	1

all	1
the	1

together	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1

they	1

	1
1:19	1
As	1
the	1

commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
he	1
numbered	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1

	1

But	1

	1

Every	1

And	1

	1
3:3	1
These	1

	1
3:4	1
And	1
Nadab	1
and	1
Abihu	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
they	1
offered	1
strange	1
fire	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
they	1

and	1
Eleazar	1

Ithamar	1
ministered	1
in	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Aaron	1
their	1

	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
3:6	1
Bring	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi	1
near,	1
and	1
present	1
them	1
before	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
minister	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
his	1

and	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
whole	1

before	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1

the	1

of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
the	1
Levites	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons:	1
they	1
are	1
wholly	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
appoint	1
Aaron	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wait	1
on	1
their	1
priest's	1
office:	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
cometh	1
nigh	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
3:12	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
instead	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
therefore	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
be	1
mine;	1
3:13	1
Because	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
are	1
mine;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
hallowed	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
in	1
Israel,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
mine	1
shall	1
they	1
be:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
saying,	1
3:15	1
Number	1

a	1

shalt	1
thou	1
number	1
them.	1
	1

	1
3:46	1
And	1

of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
more	1

3:47	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
even	1
take	1
five	1

apiece	1
by	1
the	1
poll,	1

3:48	1
And	1

	1
3:49	1
And	1

	1
5:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:2	1
Command	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
every	1
leper,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
is	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead:	1
5:3	1
Both	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
shall	1
ye	1
put	1
out,	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
shall	1
ye	1
put	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
defile	1
not	1
their	1
camps,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
whereof	1
I	1
dwell.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
out	1
without	1
the	1
camp:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:6	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
When	1
a	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
shall	1
commit	1
any	1
sin	1
that	1
men	1
commit,	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
person	1
be	1
guilty;	1
5:7	1
Then	1
they	1
shall	1
confess	1
their	1
sin	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
recompense	1
his	1
trespass	1
with	1
the	1
principal	1
thereof,	1
and	1
add	1
unto	1
it	1
the	1
fifth	1
part	1
thereof,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
trespassed.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
have	1
no	1
kinsman	1
to	1
recompense	1
the	1
trespass	1
unto,	1
let	1
the	1
trespass	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
priest;	1
beside	1
the	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
atonement,	1
whereby	1
an	1
atonement	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
every	1
offering	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
every	1
man's	1
hallowed	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
his:	1
whatsoever	1
any	1
man	1
giveth	1
the	1
priest,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
his.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
5:12	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
wife	1
go	1
aside,	1
and	1
commit	1
a	1
trespass	1
against	1
him,	1
5:13	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
lie	1
with	1
her	1
carnally,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
be	1
kept	1
close,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
witness	1
against	1
her,	1
neither	1
she	1
be	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
manner;	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
defiled:	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
not	1
defiled:	1
5:15	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
man	1
bring	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
her	1
offering	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
barley	1
meal;	1
he	1
shall	1
pour	1
no	1
oil	1
upon	1
it,	1
nor	1
put	1
frankincense	1
thereon;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
memorial,	1
bringing	1
iniquity	1
to	1
remembrance.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
bring	1
her	1
near,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
5:17	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
holy	1
water	1
in	1
an	1
earthen	1
vessel;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
water:	1
5:18	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
woman	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
uncover	1
the	1
woman's	1
head,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
memorial	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
jealousy	1
offering:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
the	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
5:19	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
charge	1
her	1
by	1
an	1
oath,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
If	1
no	1
man	1
have	1
lain	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
gone	1
aside	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
thy	1
husband,	1
be	1
thou	1
free	1
from	1
this	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
5:20	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
aside	1
to	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
some	1
man	1
have	1
lain	1
with	1
thee	1
beside	1
thine	1
husband:	1
5:21	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
charge	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
cursing,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
curse	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
among	1
thy	1
people,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
make	1
thy	1
thigh	1
to	1
rot,	1
and	1
thy	1
belly	1
to	1
swell;	1
5:22	1
And	1
this	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
thy	1
bowels,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
to	1
swell,	1
and	1
thy	1
thigh	1
to	1
rot:	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
shall	1
say,	1
Amen,	1
amen.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
write	1
these	1
curses	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
blot	1
them	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
bitter	1
water:	1
5:24	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
bitter	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
her,	1
and	1
become	1
bitter.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
jealousy	1
offering	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
woman's	1
hand,	1
and	1
shall	1
wave	1
the	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offer	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
5:26	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
an	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
offering,	1
even	1
the	1
memorial	1
thereof,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
her	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
water,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
trespass	1
against	1
her	1
husband,	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
causeth	1
the	1
curse	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
her,	1
and	1
become	1
bitter,	1
and	1
her	1
belly	1
shall	1
swell,	1
and	1
her	1
thigh	1
shall	1
rot:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
curse	1
among	1
her	1
people.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
defiled,	1
but	1
be	1
clean;	1
then	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
free,	1
and	1
shall	1
conceive	1
seed.	1
	1
5:29	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
jealousies,	1
when	1
a	1
wife	1
goeth	1
aside	1
to	1
another	1
instead	1
of	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
is	1
defiled;	1
5:30	1
Or	1
when	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealousy	1
cometh	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
be	1
jealous	1
over	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
woman	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
execute	1
upon	1
her	1
all	1
this	1
law.	1
	1
5:31	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
guiltless	1
from	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
this	1
woman	1
shall	1
bear	1
her	1
iniquity.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
6:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
either	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
shall	1
separate	1
themselves	1
to	1
vow	1
a	1
vow	1
of	1
a	1
Nazarite,	1
to	1
separate	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:3	1
He	1
shall	1
separate	1
himself	1
from	1
wine	1
and	1
strong	1
drink,	1
and	1
shall	1
drink	1
no	1
vinegar	1
of	1
wine,	1
or	1
vinegar	1
of	1
strong	1
drink,	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
drink	1
any	1
liquor	1
of	1
grapes,	1
nor	1
eat	1
moist	1
grapes,	1
or	1
dried.	1
	1
6:4	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
shall	1
he	1
eat	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
tree,	1
from	1
the	1
kernels	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
husk.	1
	1
6:5	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
vow	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
razor	1
come	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
until	1
the	1
days	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
separateth	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy,	1
and	1
shall	1
let	1
the	1
locks	1
of	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
grow.	1
	1
6:6	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
he	1
separateth	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
at	1
no	1
dead	1
body.	1
	1
6:7	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
himself	1
unclean	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
mother,	1
for	1
his	1
brother,	1
or	1
for	1
his	1
sister,	1
when	1
they	1
die:	1
because	1
the	1
consecration	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
6:8	1
All	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation	1
he	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
die	1
very	1
suddenly	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
defiled	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
consecration;	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
shave	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
cleansing,	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
shall	1
he	1
shave	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
two	1
turtles,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons,	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
6:11	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
offer	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
sinned	1
by	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
shall	1
hallow	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
same	1
day.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
consecrate	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
separation,	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
lamb	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
but	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
shall	1
be	1
lost,	1
because	1
his	1
separation	1
was	1
defiled.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarite,	1
when	1
the	1
days	1

give	1

	1

And	1
they	1

put	1

and	1
had	1
anointed	1

them;	1
7:2	1
That	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
heads	1

of	1
their	1

who	1

	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Take	1
it	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
do	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
service.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
7:7	1
Two	1
wagons	1
and	1
four	1
oxen	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gershon,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
service:	1
7:8	1
And	1
four	1

and	1
eight	1

he	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1

of	1
Ithamar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Kohath	1
he	1
gave	1
none:	1
because	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
belonging	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bear	1

	1
7:10	1
And	1

LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Aaron	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
When	1
thou	1
lightest	1

shall	1
give	1

had	1
shewed	1
Moses,	1
so	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
candlestick.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:6	1
Take	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
cleanse	1
them.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
them,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
them:	1
Sprinkle	1
water	1
of	1
purifying	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
shave	1
all	1
their	1
flesh,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
wash	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
so	1
make	1
themselves	1
clean.	1
	1
8:8	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
take	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
with	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
even	1
fine	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
another	1
young	1
bullock	1
shalt	1
thou	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
gather	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
together:	1
8:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
put	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
Levites:	1
8:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
offer	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
execute	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
bullocks:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
the	1
Levites	1
before	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:14	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
separate	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
be	1
mine.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
the	1
Levites	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cleanse	1
them,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
offering.	1
	1
8:16	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
wholly	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
instead	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
open	1
every	1
womb,	1
even	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
mine,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
beast:	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
smote	1
every	1
firstborn	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
sanctified	1
them	1
for	1
myself.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
Levites	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
Levites	1
as	1
a	1
gift	1
to	1
Aaron	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
from	1
among	1
the	1

to	1
do	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
plague	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1

	1
8:20	1
And	1
Moses,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
did	1
to	1
the	1

according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1

Moses	1
concerning	1

so	1

the	1

unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
purified,	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1

and	1
Aaron	1
offered	1

as	1
an	1

cleanse	1
them.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
went	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
sons:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
Moses	1
concerning	1
the	1
Levites,	1
so	1
did	1
they	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
8:24	1
This	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites:	1
from	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
8:25	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fifty	1
years	1
they	1
shall	1
cease	1
waiting	1
upon	1
the	1
service	1
thereof,	1
and	1
shall	1
serve	1
no	1
more:	1
8:26	1
But	1
shall	1
minister	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
charge,	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
no	1
service.	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
touching	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
9:2	1
Let	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
his	1
appointed	1
season.	1
	1
9:3	1
In	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
month,	1
at	1
even,	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rites	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
men,	1
who	1
were	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
before	1
Moses	1
and	1
before	1
Aaron	1
on	1
that	1
day:	1
9:7	1
And	1
those	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
defiled	1
by	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
man:	1
wherefore	1
are	1
we	1
kept	1
back,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Stand	1
still,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
command	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
9:10	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
you	1
or	1
of	1
your	1
posterity	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
body,	1
or	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
journey	1
afar	1
off,	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:11	1
The	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month	1
at	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
with	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
and	1
bitter	1
herbs.	1
	1
9:12	1
They	1
shall	1
leave	1
none	1
of	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
nor	1
break	1
any	1
bone	1
of	1
it:	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
passover	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
clean,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
journey,	1
and	1
forbeareth	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover,	1
even	1
the	1
same	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people:	1
because	1
he	1
brought	1
not	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
his	1
appointed	1
season,	1
that	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
sojourn	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
thereof,	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do:	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
ordinance,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
namely,	1
the	1
tent	1
of	1
the	1
testimony:	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
there	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire,	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
it	1
was	1
alway:	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode,	1
there	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
pitched	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
9:18	1
At	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
journeyed,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
pitched:	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
they	1
rested	1
in	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
tarried	1
long	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
many	1
days,	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
journeyed	1
not.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
the	1
cloud	1
abode	1
from	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
by	1
night	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:22	1
Or	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
days,	1
or	1
a	1
month,	1
or	1
a	1
year,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
tarried	1
upon	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
remaining	1
thereon,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
abode	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
journeyed	1
not:	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
journeyed.	1
	1
9:23	1
At	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
tents,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
journeyed:	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
10:2	1
Make	1
thee	1
two	1
trumpets	1
of	1
silver;	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
piece	1
shalt	1
thou	1
make	1
them:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
use	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
journeying	1
of	1
the	1
camps.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
shall	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
to	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
blow	1
but	1
with	1
one	1
trumpet,	1
then	1
the	1
princes,	1
which	1
are	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
gather	1
themselves	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:5	1
When	1
ye	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm,	1
then	1
the	1
camps	1
that	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
parts	1
shall	1
go	1
forward.	1
	1
10:6	1
When	1
ye	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
then	1
the	1
camps	1
that	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
shall	1
take	1
their	1
journey:	1
they	1
shall	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
for	1
their	1
journeys.	1
	1
10:7	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
sound	1
an	1
alarm.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
the	1
priests,	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
land	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
that	1
oppresseth	1
you,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow	1
an	1
alarm	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
remembered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
10:10	1
Also	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
your	1
gladness,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
your	1
months,	1
ye	1
shall	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets	1
over	1
your	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
your	1
peace	1
offerings;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
their	1
journeys	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Sinai;	1
and	1
the	1
cloud	1
rested	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
they	1
first	1
took	1
their	1
journey	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
10:14	1
In	1
the	1

camps	1
throughout	1
their	1
hosts:	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
host	1
was	1
Ahiezer	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammishaddai.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
over	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Asher	1
was	1
Pagiel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ocran.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
over	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Naphtali	1
was	1
Ahira	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Enan.	1
	1
10:28	1
Thus	1
were	1
the	1
journeyings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
armies,	1
when	1
they	1
set	1
forward.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Hobab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Raguel	1
the	1
Midianite,	1
Moses'	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
We	1
are	1
journeying	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you:	1
come	1
thou	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
thee	1
good:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
good	1
concerning	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
depart	1
to	1
mine	1
own	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
kindred.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Leave	1
us	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest	1
how	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
encamp	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
to	1
us	1
instead	1
of	1
eyes.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
yea,	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
what	1
goodness	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
the	1
same	1
will	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
three	1
days'	1
journey:	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
before	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
days'	1
journey,	1
to	1
search	1
out	1
a	1
resting	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
10:34	1
And	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
by	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
ark	1
set	1
forward,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
LORD,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
enemies	1
be	1
scattered;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee	1
flee	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
rested,	1
he	1
said,	1
Return,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
unto	1
the	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
complained,	1
it	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
burnt	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
consumed	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
cried	1
unto	1
Moses;	1
and	1
when	1
Moses	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
quenched.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Taberah:	1
because	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
burnt	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
the	1
mixt	1
multitude	1
that	1
was	1
among	1
them	1
fell	1
a	1
lusting:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
wept	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
us	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
11:5	1
We	1
remember	1
the	1
fish,	1
which	1
we	1
did	1
eat	1
in	1
Egypt	1
freely;	1
the	1
cucumbers,	1
and	1
the	1
melons,	1
and	1
the	1
leeks,	1
and	1
the	1
onions,	1
and	1
the	1
garlick:	1
11:6	1
But	1
now	1
our	1
soul	1
is	1
dried	1
away:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
beside	1
this	1
manna,	1
before	1
our	1
eyes.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
the	1
manna	1
was	1
as	1
coriander	1
seed,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
thereof	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
bdellium.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
about,	1
and	1
gathered	1
it,	1
and	1
ground	1
it	1
in	1
mills,	1
or	1
beat	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
mortar,	1
and	1
baked	1
it	1
in	1
pans,	1
and	1
made	1
cakes	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
fresh	1
oil.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dew	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
the	1
manna	1
fell	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:10	1
Then	1
Moses	1
heard	1
the	1
people	1
weep	1
throughout	1
their	1
families,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
tent:	1
and	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
greatly;	1
Moses	1
also	1
was	1
displeased.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
afflicted	1
thy	1
servant?	1
and	1
wherefore	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
that	1
thou	1
layest	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
upon	1
me?	1
	1
11:12	1
Have	1
I	1
conceived	1
all	1
this	1
people?	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
them,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
Carry	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
as	1
a	1
nursing	1
father	1
beareth	1
the	1
sucking	1
child,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
swarest	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers?	1
	1
11:13	1
Whence	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
flesh	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
all	1
this	1
people?	1
for	1
they	1
weep	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Give	1
us	1
flesh,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
11:14	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
alone,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
deal	1
thus	1
with	1
me,	1
kill	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
out	1
of	1
hand,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight;	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
wretchedness.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Gather	1
unto	1
me	1
seventy	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
knowest	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
officers	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
stand	1
there	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
talk	1
with	1
thee	1
there:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
bear	1
it	1
not	1
thyself	1
alone.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Sanctify	1
yourselves	1
against	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
flesh:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
wept	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
us	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
well	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
flesh,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat.	1
	1
11:19	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
one	1
day,	1
nor	1
two	1
days,	1
nor	1
five	1
days,	1
neither	1
ten	1
days,	1
nor	1
twenty	1
days;	1
11:20	1
But	1
even	1
a	1
whole	1
month,	1
until	1
it	1
come	1
out	1
at	1
your	1
nostrils,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
loathsome	1
unto	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
wept	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
came	1
we	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
The	1
people,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
am,	1
are	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
flesh,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
a	1
whole	1
month.	1
	1
11:22	1
Shall	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
the	1
herds	1
be	1
slain	1
for	1
them,	1
to	1
suffice	1
them?	1
	1
or	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
for	1
them,	1
to	1
suffice	1
them?	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
hand	1
waxed	1
short?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
now	1
whether	1
my	1
word	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
unto	1
thee	1
or	1
not.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
Moses	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
seventy	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seventy	1
elders:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
spirit	1
rested	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
prophesied,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
cease.	1
	1
11:26	1
But	1
there	1
remained	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
camp,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Eldad,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Medad:	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
rested	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
written,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
there	1
ran	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
told	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Eldad	1
and	1
Medad	1
do	1
prophesy	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Moses,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord	1
Moses,	1
forbid	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Enviest	1
thou	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
would	1
God	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people	1
were	1
prophets,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
put	1
his	1
spirit	1
upon	1
them!	1
	1
11:30	1
And	1
Moses	1
gat	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
forth	1
a	1
wind	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
brought	1
quails	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
camp,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
day's	1
journey	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
day's	1
journey	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
cubits	1
high	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
up	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
the	1
quails:	1
he	1
that	1
gathered	1
least	1
gathered	1
ten	1
homers:	1
and	1
they	1
spread	1
them	1
all	1
abroad	1
for	1
themselves	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
flesh	1
was	1
yet	1
between	1
their	1
teeth,	1
ere	1
it	1
was	1
chewed,	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
plague.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Kibrothhattaavah:	1
because	1
there	1
they	1
buried	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
lusted.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Kibrothhattaavah	1
unto	1
Hazeroth;	1
and	1
abode	1
at	1
Hazeroth.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Miriam	1
and	1
Aaron	1
spake	1
against	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
married:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
Ethiopian	1
woman.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
indeed	1
spoken	1
only	1
by	1
Moses?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
spoken	1
also	1
by	1
us?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
12:3	1
(Now	1
the	1
man	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
meek,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
suddenly	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
Miriam,	1
Come	1
out	1
ye	1
three	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
And	1
they	1
three	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
called	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Miriam:	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
came	1
forth.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear	1
now	1
my	1
words:	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
prophet	1
among	1
you,	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
make	1
myself	1
known	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
and	1
will	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
12:7	1
My	1
servant	1
Moses	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
who	1
is	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
mine	1
house.	1
	1
12:8	1
With	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
even	1
apparently,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
dark	1
speeches;	1
and	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
he	1
behold:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
against	1
my	1
servant	1
Moses?	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
the	1
cloud	1
departed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
tabernacle;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Miriam	1
became	1
leprous,	1
white	1
as	1
snow:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
looked	1
upon	1
Miriam,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
she	1
was	1
leprous.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
Aaron	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lay	1
not	1
the	1
sin	1
upon	1
us,	1
wherein	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
foolishly,	1
and	1
wherein	1
we	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
12:12	1
Let	1
her	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
dead,	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
half	1
consumed	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Heal	1
her	1
now,	1
O	1
God,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
If	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
but	1
spit	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
should	1
she	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
seven	1
days?	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
received	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Miriam	1
was	1
shut	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
camp	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
journeyed	1
not	1
till	1
Miriam	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
afterward	1
the	1
people	1
removed	1
from	1
Hazeroth,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
13:2	1
Send	1
thou	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
search	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
of	1
every	1
tribe	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
shall	1
ye	1
send	1
a	1
man,	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
ruler	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Moses	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran:	1
all	1
those	1
men	1
were	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
their	1
names:	1
of	1
the	1

Shammua	1

	1
13:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
And	1
Moses	1
called	1
Oshea	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
Jehoshua.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
this	1
way	1
southward,	1
and	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
mountain:	1
13:18	1
And	1
see	1
the	1
land,	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
strong	1
or	1
weak,	1
few	1
or	1
many;	1
13:19	1
And	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
dwell	1
in,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad;	1
and	1
what	1
cities	1
they	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
dwell	1
in,	1
whether	1
in	1
tents,	1
or	1
in	1
strong	1
holds;	1
13:20	1
And	1
what	1
the	1
land	1
is,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
fat	1
or	1
lean,	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
wood	1
therein,	1
or	1
not.	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
bring	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
Now	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
firstripe	1
grapes.	1
	1
13:21	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
land	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Zin	1
unto	1
Rehob,	1
as	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
Hamath.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
by	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Hebron;	1
where	1
Ahiman,	1
Sheshai,	1
and	1
Talmai,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak,	1
were.	1
(Now	1
Hebron	1
was	1
built	1
seven	1
years	1
before	1
Zoan	1
in	1
Egypt.)	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
Eshcol,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
from	1
thence	1
a	1
branch	1
with	1
one	1
cluster	1
of	1
grapes,	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
it	1
between	1
two	1
upon	1
a	1
staff;	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
of	1
the	1
pomegranates,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
figs.	1
	1
13:24	1
The	1
place	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
brook	1
Eshcol,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cluster	1
of	1
grapes	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cut	1
down	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
they	1
returned	1
from	1
searching	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
after	1
forty	1
days.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Moses,	1
and	1
to	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran,	1
to	1
Kadesh;	1
and	1
brought	1
back	1
word	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
thou	1
sentest	1
us,	1
and	1
surely	1
it	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:28	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
strong	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
are	1
walled,	1
and	1
very	1
great:	1
and	1
moreover	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Anak	1
there.	1
	1
13:29	1
The	1
Amalekites	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
and	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
mountains:	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwell	1
by	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Jordan.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
Caleb	1
stilled	1
the	1
people	1
before	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
possess	1
it;	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
overcome	1
it.	1
	1
13:31	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
said,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
stronger	1
than	1
we.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
up	1
an	1
evil	1
report	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
searched	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
land,	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
search	1
it,	1
is	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
eateth	1
up	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
stature.	1
	1
13:33	1
And	1
there	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
giants,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Anak,	1
which	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
giants:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
sight	1
as	1
grasshoppers,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
cried;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
wept	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron:	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Would	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt!	1
or	1
would	1
God	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness!	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
land,	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
that	1
our	1
wives	1
and	1
our	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
prey?	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt?	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
captain,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
14:5	1
Then	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
searched	1
the	1
land,	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes:	1
14:7	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
land,	1
which	1
we	1
passed	1
through	1
to	1
search	1
it,	1
is	1
an	1
exceeding	1
good	1
land.	1
	1
14:8	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
delight	1
in	1
us,	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
us;	1
a	1
land	1
which	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey.	1
	1
14:9	1
Only	1
rebel	1
not	1
ye	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
fear	1
ye	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
bread	1
for	1
us:	1
their	1
defence	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
us:	1
fear	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
bade	1
stone	1
them	1
with	1
stones.	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
How	1
long	1
will	1
this	1
people	1
provoke	1
me?	1
	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
they	1
believe	1
me,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
among	1
them?	1
	1
14:12	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
disinherit	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
of	1
thee	1
a	1
greater	1
nation	1
and	1
mightier	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Then	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
shall	1
hear	1
it,	1
(for	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
up	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
thy	1
might	1
from	1
among	1
them;)	1
14:14	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
thou	1
LORD	1
art	1
among	1
this	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
LORD	1
art	1
seen	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
that	1
thy	1
cloud	1
standeth	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
before	1
them,	1
by	1
day	1
time	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
14:15	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
kill	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
then	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
thee	1
will	1
speak,	1
saying,	1
14:16	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
them,	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
slain	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
my	1
LORD	1
be	1
great,	1
according	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken,	1
saying,	1
14:18	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
longsuffering,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
mercy,	1
forgiving	1
iniquity	1
and	1
transgression,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
clearing	1
the	1
guilty,	1
visiting	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
	1
14:19	1
Pardon,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy,	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgiven	1
this	1
people,	1
from	1
Egypt	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
pardoned	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
14:21	1
But	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Because	1
all	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
seen	1
my	1
glory,	1
and	1
my	1
miracles,	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
in	1
Egypt	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
have	1
tempted	1
me	1
now	1
these	1
ten	1
times,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
to	1
my	1
voice;	1
14:23	1
Surely	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
provoked	1
me	1
see	1
it:	1
14:24	1
But	1
my	1
servant	1
Caleb,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
spirit	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
hath	1
followed	1
me	1
fully,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
whereinto	1
he	1
went;	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
shall	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
14:25	1
(Now	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
valley.)	1
Tomorrow	1
turn	1
you,	1
and	1
get	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
14:27	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
bear	1
with	1
this	1
evil	1
congregation,	1
which	1
murmur	1
against	1
me?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
murmur	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
14:28	1
Say	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
truly	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
you:	1
14:29	1
Your	1
carcases	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
numbered	1
of	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
whole	1
number,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward	1
which	1
have	1
murmured	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
14:30	1
Doubtless	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
concerning	1
which	1
I	1
sware	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
save	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
your	1
little	1
ones,	1
which	1
ye	1
said	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
prey,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
in,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
despised.	1
	1
14:32	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
you,	1
your	1
carcases,	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:33	1
And	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
and	1
bear	1
your	1
whoredoms,	1
until	1
your	1
carcases	1
be	1
wasted	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
14:34	1
After	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
searched	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
forty	1
days,	1
each	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
shall	1
ye	1
bear	1
your	1
iniquities,	1
even	1
forty	1
years,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
my	1
breach	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
14:35	1
I	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
do	1
it	1
unto	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
congregation,	1
that	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
me:	1
in	1
this	1
wilderness	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
the	1
men,	1
which	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
land,	1
who	1
returned,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
murmur	1
against	1
him,	1
by	1
bringing	1
up	1
a	1
slander	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
14:37	1
Even	1
those	1
men	1
that	1
did	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
evil	1
report	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
plague	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun,	1
and	1
Caleb	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jephunneh,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
land,	1
lived	1
still.	1
	1
14:39	1
And	1
Moses	1
told	1
these	1
sayings	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
mourned	1
greatly.	1
	1
14:40	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
saying,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
be	1
here,	1
and	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
promised:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
14:41	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
do	1
ye	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper.	1
	1
14:42	1
Go	1
not	1
up,	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
among	1
you;	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
smitten	1
before	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
14:43	1
For	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
are	1
there	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:44	1
But	1
they	1
presumed	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
hill	1
top:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Moses,	1
departed	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
14:45	1
Then	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
that	1
hill,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them,	1
even	1
unto	1
Hormah.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
your	1
habitations,	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
15:3	1
And	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
offering	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
or	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
performing	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering,	1
or	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
the	1
herd	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
15:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
offereth	1
his	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
a	1
tenth	1
deal	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
shalt	1
thou	1
prepare	1
with	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
or	1
sacrifice,	1
for	1
one	1
lamb.	1
	1
15:6	1
Or	1
for	1
a	1
ram,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prepare	1
for	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
two	1
tenth	1
deals	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
thou	1
shalt	1
offer	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
preparest	1
a	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
performing	1
a	1
vow,	1
or	1
peace	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
15:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
bring	1
with	1
a	1
bullock	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
three	1
tenth	1
deals	1
of	1
flour	1
mingled	1
with	1
half	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
for	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
half	1
an	1
hin	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:11	1
Thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
one	1
bullock,	1
or	1
for	1
one	1
ram,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
lamb,	1
or	1
a	1
kid.	1
	1
15:12	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
prepare,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
number.	1
	1
15:13	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
shall	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
in	1
offering	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
stranger	1
sojourn	1
with	1
you,	1
or	1
whosoever	1
be	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
generations,	1
and	1
will	1
offer	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
ye	1
do,	1
so	1
he	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
15:15	1
One	1
ordinance	1
shall	1
be	1
both	1
for	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
you,	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
your	1
generations:	1
as	1
ye	1
are,	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
stranger	1
be	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:16	1
One	1
law	1
and	1
one	1
manner	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:18	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
I	1
bring	1
you,	1
15:19	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:20	1
Ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
your	1
dough	1
for	1
an	1
heave	1
offering:	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
the	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
heave	1
it.	1
	1
15:21	1
Of	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
your	1
dough	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
in	1
your	1
generations.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
erred,	1
and	1
not	1
observed	1
all	1
these	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
15:23	1
Even	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses,	1
and	1
henceforward	1
among	1
your	1
generations;	1
15:24	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
ought	1
be	1
committed	1
by	1
ignorance	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
offer	1
one	1
young	1
bullock	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
his	1
drink	1
offering,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner,	1
and	1
one	1
kid	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
ignorance:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
their	1
offering,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
sin	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
for	1
their	1
ignorance:	1
15:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them;	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
ignorance.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
soul	1
sin	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
a	1
she	1
goat	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
sinneth	1
ignorantly,	1
when	1
he	1
sinneth	1
by	1
ignorance	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
15:29	1
Ye	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
law	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
sinneth	1
through	1
ignorance,	1
both	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
15:30	1
But	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
doeth	1
ought	1
presumptuously,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
the	1
same	1
reproacheth	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
his	1
commandment,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
utterly	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
his	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
gathered	1
sticks	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
found	1
him	1
gathering	1
sticks	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
ward,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
declared	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
The	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
surely	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
shall	1
stone	1
him	1
with	1
stones	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
brought	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
and	1
he	1
died;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
15:38	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
bid	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
make	1
them	1
fringes	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
garments	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
borders	1
a	1
ribband	1
of	1
blue:	1
15:39	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
fringe,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
seek	1
not	1
after	1
your	1
own	1
heart	1
and	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
after	1
which	1
ye	1
use	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whoring:	1
15:40	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
remember,	1
and	1
do	1
all	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
which	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
God:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
Korah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Izhar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kohath,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
On,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Peleth,	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
took	1
men:	1
16:2	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
Moses,	1
with	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
assembly,	1
famous	1
in	1
the	1
congregation,	1
men	1
of	1
renown:	1
16:3	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
take	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
you,	1
seeing	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
are	1
holy,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
among	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
lift	1
ye	1
up	1
yourselves	1
above	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
when	1
Moses	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face:	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Korah	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
company,	1
saying,	1
Even	1
to	1
morrow	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
shew	1
who	1
are	1
his,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
holy;	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
him:	1
even	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
will	1
he	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
16:6	1
This	1
do;	1
Take	1
you	1
censers,	1
Korah,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
company;	1
16:7	1
And	1
put	1
fire	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
in	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
morrow:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
doth	1
choose,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holy:	1
ye	1
take	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi:	1
16:9	1
Seemeth	1
it	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
separated	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
bring	1
you	1
near	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
congregation	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
brought	1
thee	1
near	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
priesthood	1
also?	1
	1
16:11	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
both	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
ye	1
murmur	1
against	1
him?	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
call	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliab:	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up:	1
16:13	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
to	1
kill	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
except	1
thou	1
make	1
thyself	1
altogether	1
a	1
prince	1
over	1
us?	1
	1
16:14	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
brought	1
us	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
that	1
floweth	1
with	1
milk	1
and	1
honey,	1
or	1
given	1
us	1
inheritance	1
of	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
these	1
men?	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Respect	1
not	1
thou	1
their	1
offering:	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
taken	1
one	1
ass	1
from	1
them,	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
hurt	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
Be	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
company	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thou,	1
and	1
they,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
to	1
morrow:	1
16:17	1
And	1
take	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
incense	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
ye	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
censers;	1
thou	1
also,	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
his	1
censer.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
laid	1
incense	1
thereon,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
with	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
Korah	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
against	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
16:21	1
Separate	1
yourselves	1
from	1
among	1
this	1
congregation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
all	1
flesh,	1
shall	1
one	1
man	1
sin,	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
wroth	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
congregation?	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:24	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
about	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Korah,	1
Dathan,	1
and	1
Abiram.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
Moses	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram;	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
saying,	1
Depart,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
from	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
these	1
wicked	1
men,	1
and	1
touch	1
nothing	1
of	1
their's,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
consumed	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
16:27	1
So	1
they	1
gat	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Korah,	1
Dathan,	1
and	1
Abiram,	1
on	1
every	1
side:	1
and	1
Dathan	1
and	1
Abiram	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
little	1
children.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Hereby	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
works;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
done	1
them	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
16:29	1
If	1
these	1
men	1
die	1
the	1
common	1
death	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
visited	1
after	1
the	1
visitation	1
of	1
all	1
men;	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
16:30	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
thing,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
open	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallow	1
them	1
up,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
appertain	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
go	1
down	1
quick	1
into	1
the	1
pit;	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
understand	1
that	1
these	1
men	1
have	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
that	1
the	1
ground	1
clave	1
asunder	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
them:	1
16:32	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
their	1
houses,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
appertained	1
unto	1
Korah,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
goods.	1
	1
16:33	1
They,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
appertained	1
to	1
them,	1
went	1
down	1
alive	1
into	1
the	1
pit,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
closed	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
perished	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
fled	1
at	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Lest	1
the	1
earth	1
swallow	1
us	1
up	1
also.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
men	1
that	1
offered	1
incense.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:37	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
he	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
censers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
burning,	1
and	1
scatter	1
thou	1
the	1
fire	1
yonder;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
hallowed.	1
	1
16:38	1
The	1
censers	1
of	1
these	1
sinners	1
against	1
their	1
own	1
souls,	1
let	1
them	1
make	1
them	1
broad	1
plates	1
for	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
for	1
they	1
offered	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
therefore	1
they	1
are	1
hallowed:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
the	1
brasen	1
censers,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
burnt	1
had	1
offered;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
broad	1
plates	1
for	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
16:40	1
To	1
be	1
a	1
memorial	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
no	1
stranger,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
offer	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
Korah,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
company:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
16:41	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
murmured	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
have	1
killed	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
gathered	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
cloud	1
covered	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared.	1
	1
16:43	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
16:44	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
16:45	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
among	1
this	1
congregation,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
consume	1
them	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
And	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
16:46	1
And	1
Moses	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Take	1
a	1
censer,	1
and	1
put	1
fire	1
therein	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
incense,	1
and	1
go	1
quickly	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
wrath	1
gone	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
plague	1
is	1
begun.	1
	1
16:47	1
And	1
Aaron	1
took	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
congregation;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
begun	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
incense,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
16:48	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
the	1
living;	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed.	1
	1
16:49	1
Now	1
they	1
that	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
plague	1
were	1
fourteen	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred,	1
beside	1
them	1
that	1
died	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Korah.	1
	1
16:50	1
And	1
Aaron	1
returned	1
unto	1
Moses	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
17:2	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
rod	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
twelve	1
rods:	1
write	1
thou	1
every	1
man's	1
name	1
upon	1
his	1
rod.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
write	1
Aaron's	1
name	1
upon	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Levi:	1
for	1
one	1
rod	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
lay	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
before	1
the	1
testimony,	1
where	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
man's	1
rod,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
choose,	1
shall	1
blossom:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
to	1
cease	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
murmurings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whereby	1
they	1
murmur	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
princes	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
rod	1
apiece,	1
for	1
each	1
prince	1
one,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
fathers'	1
houses,	1
even	1
twelve	1
rods:	1
and	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Aaron	1
was	1
among	1
their	1
rods.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Moses	1
laid	1
up	1
the	1
rods	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Moses	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
Aaron	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi	1
was	1
budded,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
buds,	1
and	1
bloomed	1
blossoms,	1
and	1
yielded	1
almonds.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
brought	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
rods	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
looked,	1
and	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
rod.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Bring	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
again	1
before	1
the	1
testimony,	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
against	1
the	1
rebels;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
quite	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
murmurings	1
from	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
not.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
so:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
him,	1
so	1
did	1
he.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
perish,	1
we	1
all	1
perish.	1
	1
17:13	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
any	1
thing	1
near	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
die:	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
consumed	1
with	1
dying?	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
and	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
your	1
priesthood.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
thy	1
brethren	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi,	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
bring	1
thou	1
with	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
minister	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
thy	1
charge,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
only	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
that	1
neither	1
they,	1
nor	1
ye	1
also,	1
die.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
and	1
a	1
stranger	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
wrath	1
any	1
more	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
I,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
to	1
you	1
they	1
are	1
given	1
as	1
a	1
gift	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:7	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
with	1
thee	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
priest's	1
office	1
for	1
everything	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
within	1
the	1
vail;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
serve:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
your	1
priest's	1
office	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
service	1
of	1
gift:	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
cometh	1
nigh	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
mine	1
heave	1
offerings	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hallowed	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
unto	1
thee	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
them	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
anointing,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons,	1
by	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
18:9	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
thine	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things,	1
reserved	1
from	1
the	1
fire:	1
every	1
oblation	1
of	1
theirs,	1
every	1
meat	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs,	1
and	1
every	1
sin	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs,	1
and	1
every	1
trespass	1
offering	1
of	1
theirs	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
render	1
unto	1
me,	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
holy	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
sons.	1
	1
18:10	1
In	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place	1
shalt	1
thou	1
eat	1
it;	1
every	1
male	1
shall	1
eat	1
it:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
holy	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
thine;	1
the	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
their	1
gift,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
wave	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever:	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
in	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:12	1
All	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wheat,	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
them	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
first	1
ripe	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine;	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
eat	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:14	1
Every	1
thing	1
devoted	1
in	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
thine.	1
	1
18:15	1
Every	1
thing	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
matrix	1
in	1
all	1
flesh,	1
which	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
beasts,	1
shall	1
be	1
thine:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
man	1
shalt	1
thou	1
surely	1
redeem,	1
and	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
unclean	1
beasts	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
redeemed	1
from	1
a	1
month	1
old	1
shalt	1
thou	1
redeem,	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
estimation,	1
for	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
five	1
shekels,	1
after	1
the	1
shekel	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
which	1
is	1
twenty	1
gerahs.	1
	1
18:17	1
But	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
cow,	1
or	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
sheep,	1
or	1
the	1
firstling	1
of	1
a	1
goat,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
redeem;	1
they	1
are	1
holy:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sprinkle	1
their	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
shalt	1
burn	1
their	1
fat	1
for	1
an	1
offering	1
made	1
by	1
fire,	1
for	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
thine,	1
as	1
the	1
wave	1
breast	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
shoulder	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
18:19	1
All	1
the	1
heave	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
things,	1
which	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
have	1
I	1
given	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
with	1
thee,	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
salt	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
seed	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance	1
in	1
their	1
land,	1
neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
any	1
part	1
among	1
them:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
part	1
and	1
thine	1
inheritance	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:21	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Levi	1
all	1
the	1
tenth	1
in	1
Israel	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
for	1
their	1
service	1
which	1
they	1
serve,	1
even	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:22	1
Neither	1
must	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
henceforth	1
come	1
nigh	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
lest	1
they	1
bear	1
sin,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
18:23	1
But	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever	1
throughout	1
your	1
generations,	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:24	1
But	1
the	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
as	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
inherit:	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
inheritance.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
18:26	1
Thus	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
tithes	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
from	1
them	1
for	1
your	1
inheritance,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
up	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tithe.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
this	1
your	1
heave	1
offering	1
shall	1
be	1
reckoned	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
winepress.	1
	1
18:28	1
Thus	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
offer	1
an	1
heave	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
tithes,	1
which	1
ye	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
thereof	1
the	1
LORD's	1
heave	1
offering	1
to	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
18:29	1
Out	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
gifts	1
ye	1
shall	1
offer	1
every	1
heave	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
thereof,	1
even	1
the	1
hallowed	1
part	1
thereof	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
18:30	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
heaved	1
the	1
best	1
thereof	1
from	1
it,	1
then	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
as	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
winepress.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
every	1
place,	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
households:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
reward	1
for	1
your	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
no	1
sin	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
heaved	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it:	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
pollute	1
the	1
holy	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
lest	1
ye	1
die.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
saying,	1
19:2	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
bring	1
thee	1
a	1
red	1
heifer	1
without	1
spot,	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
blemish,	1
and	1
upon	1
which	1
never	1
came	1
yoke:	1
19:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
unto	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
bring	1
her	1
forth	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
slay	1
her	1
before	1
his	1
face:	1
19:4	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
finger,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
directly	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
seven	1
times:	1
19:5	1
And	1
one	1
shall	1
burn	1
the	1
heifer	1
in	1
his	1
sight;	1
her	1
skin,	1
and	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
her	1
blood,	1
with	1
her	1
dung,	1
shall	1
he	1
burn:	1
19:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
take	1
cedar	1
wood,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
the	1
heifer.	1
	1
19:7	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
afterward	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
her	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
bathe	1
his	1
flesh	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
clean	1
shall	1
gather	1
up	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
heifer,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
up	1
without	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
place,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
a	1
water	1
of	1
separation:	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
purification	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
heifer	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
the	1
even:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
stranger	1
that	1
sojourneth	1
among	1
them,	1
for	1
a	1
statute	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
19:11	1
He	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:12	1
He	1
shall	1
purify	1
himself	1
with	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
clean:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
purify	1
not	1
himself	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
then	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
19:13	1
Whosoever	1
toucheth	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
purifieth	1
not	1
himself,	1
defileth	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel:	1
because	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
was	1
not	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
his	1
uncleanness	1
is	1
yet	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
19:14	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
law,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
dieth	1
in	1
a	1
tent:	1
all	1
that	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
tent,	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
every	1
open	1
vessel,	1
which	1
hath	1
no	1
covering	1
bound	1
upon	1
it,	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
whosoever	1
toucheth	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
slain	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
fields,	1
or	1
a	1
dead	1
body,	1
or	1
a	1
bone	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
or	1
a	1
grave,	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
for	1
an	1
unclean	1
person	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
heifer	1
of	1
purification	1
for	1
sin,	1
and	1
running	1
water	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
thereto	1
in	1
a	1
vessel:	1
19:18	1
And	1
a	1
clean	1
person	1
shall	1
take	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
dip	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
persons	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
and	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
touched	1
a	1
bone,	1
or	1
one	1
slain,	1
or	1
one	1
dead,	1
or	1
a	1
grave:	1
19:19	1
And	1
the	1
clean	1
person	1
shall	1
sprinkle	1
upon	1
the	1
unclean	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
himself,	1
and	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
bathe	1
himself	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
clean	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
19:20	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
purify	1
himself,	1
that	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
congregation,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
defiled	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
sprinkled	1
upon	1
him;	1
he	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
perpetual	1
statute	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
sprinkleth	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
shall	1
wash	1
his	1
clothes;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
separation	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
the	1
unclean	1
person	1
toucheth	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean;	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
toucheth	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean	1
until	1
even.	1
	1
20:1	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation,	1
into	1
the	1
desert	1
of	1
Zin	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
abode	1
in	1
Kadesh;	1
and	1
Miriam	1
died	1
there,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
there.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
against	1
Moses	1
and	1
against	1
Aaron.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
chode	1
with	1
Moses,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
Would	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
when	1
our	1
brethren	1
died	1
before	1
the	1
LORD!	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
why	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
into	1
this	1
wilderness,	1
that	1
we	1
and	1
our	1
cattle	1
should	1
die	1
there?	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
us	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
in	1
unto	1
this	1
evil	1
place?	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
seed,	1
or	1
of	1
figs,	1
or	1
of	1
vines,	1
or	1
of	1
pomegranates;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
water	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
went	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
assembly	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces:	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
20:8	1
Take	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
gather	1
thou	1
the	1
assembly	1
together,	1
thou,	1
and	1
Aaron	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
speak	1
ye	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
give	1
forth	1
his	1
water,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
forth	1
to	1
them	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock:	1
so	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
the	1
congregation	1
and	1
their	1
beasts	1
drink.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
took	1
the	1
rod	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
he	1
commanded	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
gathered	1
the	1
congregation	1
together	1
before	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
ye	1
rebels;	1
must	1
we	1
fetch	1
you	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
rock?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Moses	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
rod	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
rock	1
twice:	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
came	1
out	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
drank,	1
and	1
their	1
beasts	1
also.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
Because	1
ye	1
believed	1
me	1
not,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
bring	1
this	1
congregation	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them.	1
	1
20:13	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Meribah;	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
strove	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
messengers	1
from	1
Kadesh	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
thy	1
brother	1
Israel,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
the	1
travail	1
that	1
hath	1
befallen	1
us:	1
20:15	1
How	1
our	1
fathers	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
vexed	1
us,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers:	1
20:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
heard	1
our	1
voice,	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
us	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
Kadesh,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
thy	1
border:	1
20:17	1
Let	1
us	1
pass,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
through	1
thy	1
country:	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fields,	1
or	1
through	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
wells:	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
high	1
way,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
Edom	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
pass	1
by	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
way:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
cattle	1
drink	1
of	1
thy	1
water,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
for	1
it:	1
I	1
will	1
only,	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
else,	1
go	1
through	1
on	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
through.	1
And	1
Edom	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
much	1
people,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
hand.	1
	1
20:21	1
Thus	1
Edom	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
Israel	1
passage	1
through	1
his	1
border:	1
wherefore	1
Israel	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation,	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Kadesh,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hor.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron	1
in	1
mount	1
Hor,	1
by	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom,	1
saying,	1
20:24	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
ye	1
rebelled	1
against	1
my	1
word	1
at	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
Meribah.	1
	1
20:25	1
Take	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hor:	1
20:26	1
And	1
strip	1
Aaron	1
of	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
there.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
Moses	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
mount	1
Hor	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Moses	1
stripped	1
Aaron	1
of	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
Aaron	1
died	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount:	1
and	1
Moses	1
and	1
Eleazar	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
saw	1
that	1
Aaron	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
mourned	1
for	1
Aaron	1
thirty	1
days,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
when	1
king	1
Arad	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
south,	1
heard	1
tell	1
that	1
Israel	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
spies;	1
then	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
took	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
prisoners.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
Israel	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
indeed	1
deliver	1
this	1
people	1
into	1
my	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
Canaanites;	1
and	1
they	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them	1
and	1
their	1
cities:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Hormah.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
mount	1
Hor	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
to	1
compass	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom:	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
much	1
discouraged	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
spake	1
against	1
God,	1
and	1
against	1
Moses,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
bread,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
water;	1
and	1
our	1
soul	1
loatheth	1
this	1
light	1
bread.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
fiery	1
serpents	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
bit	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
died.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
Moses,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
against	1
thee;	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
serpents	1
from	1
us.	1
And	1
Moses	1
prayed	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Make	1
thee	1
a	1
fiery	1
serpent,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
pole:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
bitten,	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
upon	1
it,	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
Moses	1
made	1
a	1
serpent	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
pole,	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
serpent	1
had	1
bitten	1
any	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
serpent	1
of	1
brass,	1
he	1
lived.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
set	1
forward,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Oboth.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
they	1
journeyed	1
from	1
Oboth,	1
and	1
pitched	1
at	1
Ijeabarim,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Moab,	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising.	1
	1
21:12	1
From	1
thence	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Zared.	1
	1
21:13	1
From	1
thence	1
they	1
removed,	1
and	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites:	1
for	1
Arnon	1
is	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab,	1
between	1
Moab	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:14	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
wars	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
brooks	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
21:15	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
brooks	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
Ar,	1
and	1
lieth	1
upon	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Beer:	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
well	1
whereof	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Gather	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
water.	1
	1
21:17	1
Then	1
Israel	1
sang	1
this	1
song,	1
Spring	1
up,	1
O	1
well;	1
sing	1
ye	1
unto	1
it:	1
21:18	1
The	1
princes	1
digged	1
the	1
well,	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
digged	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
lawgiver,	1
with	1
their	1
staves.	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Mattanah:	1
21:19	1
And	1
from	1
Mattanah	1
to	1
Nahaliel:	1
and	1
from	1
Nahaliel	1
to	1
Bamoth:	1
21:20	1
And	1
from	1
Bamoth	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Pisgah,	1
which	1
looketh	1
toward	1
Jeshimon.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
saying,	1
21:22	1
Let	1
me	1
pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land:	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
into	1
the	1
fields,	1
or	1
into	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
well:	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
high	1
way,	1
until	1
we	1
be	1
past	1
thy	1
borders.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
Sihon	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
Israel	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
his	1
border:	1
but	1
Sihon	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jahaz,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Israel	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
possessed	1
his	1
land	1
from	1
Arnon	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
for	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
was	1
strong.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
Israel	1
took	1
all	1
these	1
cities:	1
and	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
in	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:26	1
For	1
Heshbon	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
who	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
former	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
taken	1
all	1
his	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
even	1
unto	1
Arnon.	1
	1
21:27	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
that	1
speak	1
in	1
proverbs	1
say,	1
Come	1
into	1
Heshbon,	1
let	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon	1
be	1
built	1
and	1
prepared:	1
21:28	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fire	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
a	1
flame	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sihon:	1
it	1
hath	1
consumed	1
Ar	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Arnon.	1
	1
21:29	1
Woe	1
to	1
thee,	1
Moab!	1
thou	1
art	1
undone,	1
O	1
people	1
of	1
Chemosh:	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
his	1
sons	1
that	1
escaped,	1
and	1
his	1
daughters,	1
into	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:30	1
We	1
have	1
shot	1
at	1
them;	1
Heshbon	1
is	1
perished	1
even	1
unto	1
Dibon,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
laid	1
them	1
waste	1
even	1
unto	1
Nophah,	1
which	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
Medeba.	1
	1
21:31	1
Thus	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
21:32	1
And	1
Moses	1
sent	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
Jaazer,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof,	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
the	1
Amorites	1
that	1
were	1
there.	1
	1
21:33	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Bashan:	1
and	1
Og	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
them,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
at	1
Edrei.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
Fear	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
his	1
land;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Heshbon.	1
	1
21:35	1
So	1
they	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people,	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
left	1
him	1
alive:	1
and	1
they	1
possessed	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
set	1
forward,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Moab	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Jordan	1
by	1
Jericho.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
Israel	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
Moab	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
many:	1
and	1
Moab	1
was	1
distressed	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
Moab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Now	1
shall	1
this	1
company	1
lick	1
up	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
round	1
about	1
us,	1
as	1
the	1
ox	1
licketh	1
up	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
And	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor	1
was	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
22:5	1
He	1
sent	1
messengers	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
to	1
Pethor,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
to	1
call	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Egypt:	1
behold,	1
they	1
cover	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
they	1
abide	1
over	1
against	1
me:	1
22:6	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
curse	1
me	1
this	1
people;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
mighty	1
for	1
me:	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
prevail,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
smite	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
blessest	1
is	1
blessed,	1
and	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
cursest	1
is	1
cursed.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Moab	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Midian	1
departed	1
with	1
the	1
rewards	1
of	1
divination	1
in	1
their	1
hand;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Balak.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Lodge	1
here	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
word	1
again,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab	1
abode	1
with	1
Balaam.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
men	1
are	1
these	1
with	1
thee?	1
22:10	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
hath	1
sent	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
22:11	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
people	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
which	1
covereth	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
come	1
now,	1
curse	1
me	1
them;	1
peradventure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
drive	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
curse	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
blessed.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Balaam	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Balak,	1
Get	1
you	1
into	1
your	1
land:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
refuseth	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
Balak,	1
and	1
said,	1
Balaam	1
refuseth	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
Balak	1
sent	1
yet	1
again	1
princes,	1
more,	1
and	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
Let	1
nothing,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hinder	1
thee	1
from	1
coming	1
unto	1
me:	1
22:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
promote	1
thee	1
unto	1
very	1
great	1
honour,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me:	1
come	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
curse	1
me	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
Balaam	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Balak,	1
If	1
Balak	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
his	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
do	1
less	1
or	1
more.	1
	1
22:19	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
tarry	1
ye	1
also	1
here	1
this	1
night,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
more.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
Balaam	1
at	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
thee,	1
rise	1
up,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
but	1
yet	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
shalt	1
thou	1
do.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
Balaam	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
God's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
because	1
he	1
went:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
an	1
adversary	1
against	1
him.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
upon	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
servants	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
his	1
sword	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
Balaam	1
smote	1
the	1
ass,	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
22:24	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
a	1
wall	1
being	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
wall	1
on	1
that	1
side.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
thrust	1
herself	1
unto	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
crushed	1
Balaam's	1
foot	1
against	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
her	1
again.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
further,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
narrow	1
place,	1
where	1
was	1
no	1
way	1
to	1
turn	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
22:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ass	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
under	1
Balaam:	1
and	1
Balaam's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
ass	1
with	1
a	1
staff.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten	1
me	1
these	1
three	1
times?	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
Balaam	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
ass,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me:	1
I	1
would	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
sword	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
for	1
now	1
would	1
I	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
22:30	1
And	1
the	1
ass	1
said	1
unto	1
Balaam,	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
thine	1
ass,	1
upon	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
ridden	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
thine	1
unto	1
this	1
day?	1
was	1
I	1
ever	1
wont	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay.	1
	1
22:31	1
Then	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
his	1
sword	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
