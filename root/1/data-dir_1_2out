the	1
tent,	1
she	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
mantle.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thirsty.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
drink,	1
and	1
covered	1
him.	1
	1
4:20	1
Again	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Stand	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
doth	1
come	1
and	1
enquire	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
man	1
here?	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
No.	1
	1
4:21	1
Then	1
Jael	1
Heber's	1
wife	1
took	1
a	1
nail	1
of	1
the	1
tent,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
hammer	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
softly	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
nail	1
into	1
his	1
temples,	1
and	1
fastened	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
ground:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
and	1
weary.	1
So	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
4:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
as	1
Barak	1
pursued	1
Sisera,	1
Jael	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
seekest.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
tent,	1
behold,	1
Sisera	1
lay	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
nail	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
temples.	1
	1
4:23	1
So	1
God	1
subdued	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
Jabin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
prospered,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Jabin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
destroyed	1
Jabin	1
king	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
sang	1
Deborah	1
and	1
Barak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
5:2	1
Praise	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
the	1
avenging	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
willingly	1
offered	1
themselves.	1
	1
5:3	1
Hear,	1
O	1
ye	1
kings;	1
give	1
ear,	1
O	1
ye	1
princes;	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praise	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
out	1
of	1
Seir,	1
when	1
thou	1
marchedst	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Edom,	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
dropped,	1
the	1
clouds	1
also	1
dropped	1
water.	1
	1
5:5	1
The	1
mountains	1
melted	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
that	1
Sinai	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:6	1
In	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Shamgar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Anath,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jael,	1
the	1
highways	1
were	1
unoccupied,	1
and	1
the	1
travellers	1
walked	1
through	1
byways.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
ceased,	1
they	1
ceased	1
in	1
Israel,	1
until	1
that	1
I	1
Deborah	1
arose,	1
that	1
I	1
arose	1
a	1
mother	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
chose	1
new	1
gods;	1
then	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
the	1
gates:	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
shield	1
or	1
spear	1
seen	1
among	1
forty	1
thousand	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
5:9	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
toward	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
offered	1
themselves	1
willingly	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
Bless	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:10	1
Speak,	1
ye	1
that	1
ride	1
on	1
white	1
asses,	1
ye	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
5:11	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
archers	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
drawing	1
water,	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
rehearse	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
toward	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
his	1
villages	1
in	1
Israel:	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
gates.	1
	1
5:12	1
Awake,	1
awake,	1
Deborah:	1
awake,	1
awake,	1
utter	1
a	1
song:	1
arise,	1
Barak,	1
and	1
lead	1
thy	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Abinoam.	1
	1
5:13	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
that	1
remaineth	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
nobles	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
me	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
5:14	1
Out	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
them	1
against	1
Amalek;	1
after	1
thee,	1
Benjamin,	1
among	1
thy	1
people;	1
out	1
of	1
Machir	1
came	1
down	1
governors,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
they	1
that	1
handle	1
the	1
pen	1
of	1
the	1
writer.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Issachar	1
were	1
with	1
Deborah;	1
even	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
also	1
Barak:	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
on	1
foot	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
For	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Reuben	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
thoughts	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
5:16	1
Why	1
abodest	1
thou	1
among	1
the	1
sheepfolds,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
bleatings	1
of	1
the	1
flocks?	1
For	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
Reuben	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
searchings	1
of	1
heart.	1
	1
5:17	1
Gilead	1
abode	1
beyond	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
why	1
did	1
Dan	1
remain	1
in	1
ships?	1
Asher	1
continued	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shore,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
his	1
breaches.	1
	1
5:18	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
Naphtali	1
were	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
jeoparded	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
5:19	1
The	1
kings	1
came	1
and	1
fought,	1
then	1
fought	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Canaan	1
in	1
Taanach	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Megiddo;	1
they	1
took	1
no	1
gain	1
of	1
money.	1
	1
5:20	1
They	1
fought	1
from	1
heaven;	1
the	1
stars	1
in	1
their	1
courses	1
fought	1
against	1
Sisera.	1
	1
5:21	1
The	1
river	1
of	1
Kishon	1
swept	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
ancient	1
river,	1
the	1
river	1
Kishon.	1
O	1
my	1
soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
trodden	1
down	1
strength.	1
	1
5:22	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
horsehoofs	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
pransings,	1
the	1
pransings	1
of	1
their	1
mighty	1
ones.	1
	1
5:23	1
Curse	1
ye	1
Meroz,	1
said	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
curse	1
ye	1
bitterly	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
the	1
mighty.	1
	1
5:24	1
Blessed	1
above	1
women	1
shall	1
Jael	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Heber	1
the	1
Kenite	1
be,	1
blessed	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
above	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
tent.	1
	1
5:25	1
He	1
asked	1
water,	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
milk;	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
butter	1
in	1
a	1
lordly	1
dish.	1
	1
5:26	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
nail,	1
and	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
workmen's	1
hammer;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
hammer	1
she	1
smote	1
Sisera,	1
she	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
pierced	1
and	1
stricken	1
through	1
his	1
temples.	1
	1
5:27	1
At	1
her	1
feet	1
he	1
bowed,	1
he	1
fell,	1
he	1
lay	1
down:	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
he	1
bowed,	1
he	1
fell:	1
where	1
he	1
bowed,	1
there	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
dead.	1
	1
5:28	1
The	1
mother	1
of	1
Sisera	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
cried	1
through	1
the	1
lattice,	1
Why	1
is	1
his	1
chariot	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
coming?	1
why	1
tarry	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
his	1
chariots?	1
	1
5:29	1
Her	1
wise	1
ladies	1
answered	1
her,	1
yea,	1
she	1
returned	1
answer	1
to	1
herself,	1
5:30	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
sped?	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
divided	1
the	1
prey;	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
damsel	1
or	1
two;	1
to	1
Sisera	1
a	1
prey	1
of	1
divers	1
colours,	1
a	1
prey	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
of	1
needlework,	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
of	1
needlework	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
take	1
the	1
spoil?	1
	1
5:31	1
So	1
let	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
perish,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
forth	1
in	1
his	1
might.	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
made	1
them	1
the	1
dens	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
caves,	1
and	1
strong	1
holds.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
Israel	1
had	1
sown,	1
that	1
the	1
Midianites	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
even	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
them;	1
6:4	1
And	1
they	1
encamped	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
till	1
thou	1
come	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
sustenance	1
for	1
Israel,	1
neither	1
sheep,	1
nor	1
ox,	1
nor	1
ass.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
cattle	1
and	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
as	1
grasshoppers	1
for	1
multitude;	1
for	1
both	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
camels	1
were	1
without	1
number:	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
Israel	1
was	1
greatly	1
impoverished	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
6:8	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
a	1
prophet	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
you	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
bondage;	1
6:9	1
And	1
I	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
oppressed	1
you,	1
and	1
drave	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
gave	1
you	1
their	1
land;	1
6:10	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
fear	1
not	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
in	1
whose	1
land	1
ye	1
dwell:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
obeyed	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
an	1
oak	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Ophrah,	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
Joash	1
the	1
Abiezrite:	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Gideon	1
threshed	1
wheat	1
by	1
the	1
winepress,	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
my	1
Lord,	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
why	1
then	1
is	1
all	1
this	1
befallen	1
us?	1
and	1
where	1
be	1
all	1
his	1
miracles	1
which	1
our	1
fathers	1
told	1
us	1
of,	1
saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
bring	1
us	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt?	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
us,	1
and	1
delivered	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
might,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
sent	1
thee?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Oh	1
my	1
Lord,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
save	1
Israel?	1
	1
behold,	1
my	1
family	1
is	1
poor	1
in	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
Midianites	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
then	1
shew	1
me	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
thou	1
talkest	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
6:18	1
Depart	1
not	1
hence,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
present,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
Gideon	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
made	1
ready	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
unleavened	1
cakes	1
of	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
flour:	1
the	1
flesh	1
he	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
basket,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
broth	1
in	1
a	1
pot,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
oak,	1
and	1
presented	1
it.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
upon	1
this	1
rock,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
broth.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes;	1
and	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes.	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
when	1
Gideon	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Gideon	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God!	1
for	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee;	1
fear	1
not:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
6:24	1
Then	1
Gideon	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
there	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
Jehovahshalom:	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
in	1
Ophrah	1
of	1
the	1
Abiezrites.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
father's	1
young	1
bullock,	1
even	1
the	1
second	1
bullock	1
of	1
seven	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
hath,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
grove	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
it:	1
6:26	1
And	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
this	1
rock,	1
in	1
the	1
ordered	1
place,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
second	1
bullock,	1
and	1
offer	1
a	1
burnt	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
grove	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
down.	1
	1
6:27	1
Then	1
Gideon	1
took	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
because	1
he	1
feared	1
his	1
father's	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
by	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal	1
was	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
grove	1
was	1
cut	1
down	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
bullock	1
was	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
built.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Who	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing?	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
enquired	1
and	1
asked,	1
they	1
said,	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
6:30	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
said	1
unto	1
Joash,	1
Bring	1
out	1
thy	1
son,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die:	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
grove	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
Joash	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
stood	1
against	1
him,	1
Will	1
ye	1
plead	1
for	1
Baal?	1
will	1
ye	1
save	1
him?	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
plead	1
for	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
whilst	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
morning:	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
god,	1
let	1
him	1
plead	1
for	1
himself,	1
because	1
one	1
hath	1
cast	1
down	1
his	1
altar.	1
	1
6:32	1
Therefore	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
Jerubbaal,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
Baal	1
plead	1
against	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
thrown	1
down	1
his	1
altar.	1
	1
6:33	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Midianites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
over,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
6:34	1
But	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet;	1
and	1
Abiezer	1
was	1
gathered	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
throughout	1
all	1
Manasseh;	1
who	1
also	1
was	1
gathered	1
after	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Asher,	1
and	1
unto	1
Zebulun,	1
and	1
unto	1
Naphtali;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
	1
6:36	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
Israel	1
by	1
mine	1
hand,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
6:37	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
fleece	1
of	1
wool	1
in	1
the	1
floor;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
dew	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
fleece	1
only,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
dry	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
beside,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save	1
Israel	1
by	1
mine	1
hand,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
6:38	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so:	1
for	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
and	1
thrust	1
the	1
fleece	1
together,	1
and	1
wringed	1
the	1
dew	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fleece,	1
a	1
bowl	1
full	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
anger	1
be	1
hot	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
but	1
this	1
once:	1
let	1
me	1
prove,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
but	1
this	1
once	1
with	1
the	1
fleece;	1
let	1
it	1
now	1
be	1
dry	1
only	1
upon	1
the	1
fleece,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
ground	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
dew.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
so	1
that	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
dry	1
upon	1
the	1
fleece	1
only,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
dew	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
Jerubbaal,	1
who	1
is	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
rose	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
pitched	1
beside	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Harod:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
them,	1
by	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Moreh,	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
The	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee	1
are	1
too	1
many	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Midianites	1
into	1
their	1
hands,	1
lest	1
Israel	1
vaunt	1
themselves	1
against	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Mine	1
own	1
hand	1
hath	1
saved	1
me.	1
	1
7:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
go	1
to,	1
proclaim	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
fearful	1
and	1
afraid,	1
let	1
him	1
return	1
and	1
depart	1
early	1
from	1
mount	1
Gilead.	1
And	1
there	1
returned	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand;	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
ten	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
The	1
people	1
are	1
yet	1
too	1
many;	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
them	1
for	1
thee	1
there:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
This	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
of	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
This	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
not	1
go.	1
	1
7:5	1
So	1
he	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
lappeth	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
his	1
tongue,	1
as	1
a	1
dog	1
lappeth,	1
him	1
shalt	1
thou	1
set	1
by	1
himself;	1
likewise	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
boweth	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
lapped,	1
putting	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
their	1
mouth,	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
men:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
bowed	1
down	1
upon	1
their	1
knees	1
to	1
drink	1
water.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
By	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
lapped	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
Midianites	1
into	1
thine	1
hand:	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
people	1
go	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
victuals	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
their	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
Israel	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
tent,	1
and	1
retained	1
those	1
three	1
hundred	1
men:	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian	1
was	1
beneath	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
it	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
7:10	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
fear	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
go	1
thou	1
with	1
Phurah	1
thy	1
servant	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
host:	1
7:11	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
say;	1
and	1
afterward	1
shall	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
strengthened	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
host.	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
down	1
with	1
Phurah	1
his	1
servant	1
unto	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
armed	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
Midianites	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
lay	1
along	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
like	1
grasshoppers	1
for	1
multitude;	1
and	1
their	1
camels	1
were	1
without	1
number,	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
when	1
Gideon	1
was	1
come,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
a	1
dream	1
unto	1
his	1
fellow,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
barley	1
bread	1
tumbled	1
into	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
tent,	1
and	1
smote	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
fell,	1
and	1
overturned	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
tent	1
lay	1
along.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
his	1
fellow	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
save	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
hath	1
God	1
delivered	1
Midian,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Gideon	1
heard	1
the	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
that	1
he	1
worshipped,	1
and	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
your	1
hand	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
into	1
three	1
companies,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
trumpet	1
in	1
every	1
man's	1
hand,	1
with	1
empty	1
pitchers,	1
and	1
lamps	1
within	1
the	1
pitchers.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Look	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
do	1
likewise:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
7:18	1
When	1
I	1
blow	1
with	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpets	1
also	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
camp,	1
and	1
say,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
7:19	1
So	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
the	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
watch;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
but	1
newly	1
set	1
the	1
watch:	1
and	1
they	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
pitchers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
companies	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
pitchers,	1
and	1
held	1
the	1
lamps	1
in	1
their	1
left	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hands	1
to	1
blow	1
withal:	1
and	1
they	1
cried,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
ran,	1
and	1
cried,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
set	1
every	1
man's	1
sword	1
against	1
his	1
fellow,	1
even	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
host:	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
fled	1
to	1
Bethshittah	1
in	1
Zererath,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Abelmeholah,	1
unto	1
Tabbath.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Asher,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
Midianites.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
Gideon	1
sent	1
messengers	1
throughout	1
all	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
saying,	1
come	1
down	1
against	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
and	1
take	1
before	1
them	1
the	1
waters	1
unto	1
Bethbarah	1
and	1
Jordan.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
waters	1
unto	1
Bethbarah	1
and	1
Jordan.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
two	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Midianites,	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb;	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
Oreb	1
upon	1
the	1
rock	1
Oreb,	1
and	1
Zeeb	1
they	1
slew	1
at	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
Zeeb,	1
and	1
pursued	1
Midian,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb	1
to	1
Gideon	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
served	1
us	1
thus,	1
that	1
thou	1
calledst	1
us	1
not,	1
when	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
Midianites?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
chide	1
with	1
him	1
sharply.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
now	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
you?	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
gleaning	1
of	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
vintage	1
of	1
Abiezer?	1
	1
8:3	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Oreb	1
and	1
Zeeb:	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
you?	1
Then	1
their	1
anger	1
was	1
abated	1
toward	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Gideon	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
he,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
faint,	1
yet	1
pursuing	1
them.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
Give,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
faint,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
pursuing	1
after	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Succoth	1
said,	1
Are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
now	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
give	1
bread	1
unto	1
thine	1
army?	1
8:7	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
into	1
mine	1
hand,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
tear	1
your	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
thorns	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
with	1
briers.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
thence	1
to	1
Penuel,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Penuel	1
answered	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth	1
had	1
answered	1
him.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Penuel,	1
saying,	1
When	1
I	1
come	1
again	1
in	1
peace,	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
down	1
this	1
tower.	1
	1
8:10	1
Now	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
were	1
in	1
Karkor,	1
and	1
their	1
hosts	1
with	1
them,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men,	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east:	1
for	1
there	1
fell	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
Gideon	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
tents	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
Nobah	1
and	1
Jogbehah,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
secure.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
when	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
fled,	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian,	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
all	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
returned	1
from	1
battle	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
8:14	1
And	1
caught	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
enquired	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
described	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
thereof,	1
even	1
threescore	1
and	1
seventeen	1
men.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
with	1
whom	1
ye	1
did	1
upbraid	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Are	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
now	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
give	1
bread	1
unto	1
thy	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
weary?	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thorns	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
and	1
briers,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Succoth.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
he	1
beat	1
down	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Penuel,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
8:18	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
were	1
they	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
at	1
Tabor?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
As	1
thou	1
art,	1
so	1
were	1
they;	1
each	1
one	1
resembled	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
They	1
were	1
my	1
brethren,	1
even	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
my	1
mother:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
saved	1
them	1
alive,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
slay	1
you.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jether	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
Up,	1
and	1
slay	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
youth	1
drew	1
not	1
his	1
sword:	1
for	1
he	1
feared,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
youth.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna	1
said,	1
Rise	1
thou,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
strength.	1
And	1
Gideon	1
arose,	1
and	1
slew	1
Zebah	1
and	1
Zalmunna,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
ornaments	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
camels'	1
necks.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
Rule	1
thou	1
over	1
us,	1
both	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
thy	1
son's	1
son	1
also:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
neither	1
shall	1
my	1
son	1
rule	1
over	1
you:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
rule	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
Gideon	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
a	1
request	1
of	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
earrings	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
golden	1
earrings,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
Ishmaelites.)	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
We	1
will	1
willingly	1
give	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
spread	1
a	1
garment,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
therein	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
earrings	1
of	1
his	1
prey.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
earrings	1
that	1
he	1
requested	1
was	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold;	1
beside	1
ornaments,	1
and	1
collars,	1
and	1
purple	1
raiment	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Midian,	1
and	1
beside	1
the	1
chains	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
their	1
camels'	1
necks.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
Gideon	1
made	1
an	1
ephod	1
thereof,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
city,	1
even	1
in	1
Ophrah:	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
went	1
thither	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
it:	1
which	1
thing	1
became	1
a	1
snare	1
unto	1
Gideon,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
8:28	1
Thus	1
was	1
Midian	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
heads	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
in	1
quietness	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gideon.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
Jerubbaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Gideon	1
had	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
begotten:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
wives.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
his	1
concubine	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Shechem,	1
she	1
also	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
he	1
called	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
Gideon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
died	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Joash	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
Ophrah	1
of	1
the	1
Abiezrites.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Gideon	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again,	1
and	1
went	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
made	1
Baalberith	1
their	1
god.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
who	1
had	1
delivered	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side:	1
8:35	1
Neither	1
shewed	1
they	1
kindness	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
namely,	1
Gideon,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
went	1
to	1
Shechem	1
unto	1
his	1
mother's	1
brethren,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
mother's	1
father,	1
saying,	1
9:2	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
Whether	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
you,	1
either	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
which	1
are	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
reign	1
over	1
you,	1
or	1
that	1
one	1
reign	1
over	1
you?	1
remember	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
bone	1
and	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
brethren	1
spake	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
all	1
these	1
words:	1
and	1
their	1
hearts	1
inclined	1
to	1
follow	1
Abimelech;	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
our	1
brother.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baalberith,	1
wherewith	1
Abimelech	1
hired	1
vain	1
and	1
light	1
persons,	1
which	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
at	1
Ophrah,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal,	1
being	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
upon	1
one	1
stone:	1
notwithstanding	1
yet	1
Jotham	1
the	1
youngest	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
was	1
left;	1
for	1
he	1
hid	1
himself.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo,	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
made	1
Abimelech	1
king,	1
by	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
pillar	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
Jotham,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
mount	1
Gerizim,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
cried,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
trees	1
went	1
forth	1
on	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
anoint	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
Reign	1
thou	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:9	1
But	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
fatness,	1
wherewith	1
by	1
me	1
they	1
honour	1
God	1
and	1
man,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
trees	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
forsake	1
my	1
sweetness,	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
fruit,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
trees	1
unto	1
the	1
vine,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
vine	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Should	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
wine,	1
which	1
cheereth	1
God	1
and	1
man,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
promoted	1
over	1
the	1
trees?	1
	1
9:14	1
Then	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
unto	1
the	1
bramble,	1
Come	1
thou,	1
and	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
bramble	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
trees,	1
If	1
in	1
truth	1
ye	1
anoint	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
you,	1
then	1
come	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
my	1
shadow:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bramble,	1
and	1
devour	1
the	1
cedars	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
9:16	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
truly	1
and	1
sincerely,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
Abimelech	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
Jerubbaal	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deserving	1
of	1
his	1
hands;	1
9:17	1
(For	1
my	1
father	1
fought	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
adventured	1
his	1
life	1
far,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Midian:	1
9:18	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
up	1
against	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
have	1
slain	1
his	1
sons,	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
persons,	1
upon	1
one	1
stone,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
Abimelech,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
maidservant,	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
brother;)	1
9:19	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
have	1
dealt	1
truly	1
and	1
sincerely	1
with	1
Jerubbaal	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
house	1
this	1
day,	1
then	1
rejoice	1
ye	1
in	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
also	1
rejoice	1
in	1
you:	1
9:20	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
devour	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo;	1
and	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo,	1
and	1
devour	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
Jotham	1
ran	1
away,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Beer,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Abimelech	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
9:22	1
When	1
Abimelech	1
had	1
reigned	1
three	1
years	1
over	1
Israel,	1
9:23	1
Then	1
God	1
sent	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
between	1
Abimelech	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
with	1
Abimelech:	1
9:24	1
That	1
the	1
cruelty	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
sons	1
of	1
Jerubbaal	1
might	1
come,	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
Abimelech	1
their	1
brother,	1
which	1
slew	1
them;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
which	1
aided	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
set	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
they	1
robbed	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
along	1
that	1
way	1
by	1
them:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Shechem:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
put	1
their	1
confidence	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
gathered	1
their	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
trode	1
the	1
grapes,	1
and	1
made	1
merry,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
god,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
cursed	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Shechem,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
him?	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal?	1
and	1
Zebul	1
his	1
officer?	1
serve	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Hamor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Shechem:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
we	1
serve	1
him?	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
this	1
people	1
were	1
under	1
my	1
hand!	1
then	1
would	1
I	1
remove	1
Abimelech.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Abimelech,	1
Increase	1
thine	1
army,	1
and	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
when	1
Zebul	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed,	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Abimelech	1
privily,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
Shechem;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
fortify	1
the	1
city	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:32	1
Now	1
therefore	1
up	1
by	1
night,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
9:33	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
up,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rise	1
early,	1
and	1
set	1
upon	1
the	1
city:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
when	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
him	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
thee,	1
then	1
mayest	1
thou	1
do	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
occasion.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
they	1
laid	1
wait	1
against	1
Shechem	1
in	1
four	1
companies.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
Gaal	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ebed	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
from	1
lying	1
in	1
wait.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
when	1
Gaal	1
saw	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Zebul,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
come	1
people	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains.	1
And	1
Zebul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
men.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Gaal	1
spake	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
See	1
there	1
come	1
people	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
another	1
company	1
come	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Meonenim.	1
	1
9:38	1
Then	1
said	1
Zebul	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
now	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Who	1
is	1
Abimelech,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
him?	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
despised?	1
go	1
out,	1
I	1
pray	1
now,	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Gaal	1
went	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
chased	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
fled	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
many	1
were	1
overthrown	1
and	1
wounded,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Arumah:	1
and	1
Zebul	1
thrust	1
out	1
Gaal	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
Shechem.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
Abimelech.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
into	1
three	1
companies,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
them.	1
	1
9:44	1
And	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
other	1
companies	1
ran	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
9:45	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
all	1
that	1
day;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
therein,	1
and	1
beat	1
down	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
sowed	1
it	1
with	1
salt.	1
	1
9:46	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
god	1
Berith.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Abimelech,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
9:48	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Zalmon,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
took	1
an	1
axe	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
bough	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
What	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
me	1
do,	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
9:49	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
likewise	1
cut	1
down	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
bough,	1
and	1
followed	1
Abimelech,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
hold	1
on	1
fire	1
upon	1
them;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Shechem	1
died	1
also,	1
about	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
9:50	1
Then	1
went	1
Abimelech	1
to	1
Thebez,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Thebez,	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
9:51	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
tower	1
within	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thither	1
fled	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shut	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tower.	1
	1
9:52	1
And	1
Abimelech	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
hard	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
to	1
burn	1
it	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
9:53	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
cast	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
upon	1
Abimelech's	1
head,	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
brake	1
his	1
skull.	1
	1
9:54	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
hastily	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Draw	1
thy	1
sword,	1
and	1
slay	1
me,	1
that	1
men	1
say	1
not	1
of	1
me,	1
A	1
women	1
slew	1
him.	1
And	1
his	1
young	1
man	1
thrust	1
him	1
through,	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
9:55	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
Abimelech	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
departed	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
9:56	1
Thus	1
God	1
rendered	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Abimelech,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
slaying	1
his	1
seventy	1
brethren:	1
9:57	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Shechem	1
did	1
God	1
render	1
upon	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
Jotham	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbaal.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
after	1
Abimelech	1
there	1
arose	1
to	1
defend	1
Israel	1
Tola	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Puah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Dodo,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Issachar;	1
and	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Shamir	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
and	1
three	1
years,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Shamir.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
arose	1
Jair,	1
a	1
Gileadite,	1
and	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
thirty	1
sons	1
that	1
rode	1
on	1
thirty	1
ass	1
colts,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
thirty	1
cities,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
Havothjair	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
Jair	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Camon.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
Ashtaroth,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
not	1
him.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
hot	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
that	1
year	1
they	1
vexed	1
and	1
oppressed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Gilead.	1
	1
10:9	1
Moreover	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
fight	1
also	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
against	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ephraim;	1
so	1
that	1
Israel	1
was	1
sore	1
distressed.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
both	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
also	1
served	1
Baalim.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
10:12	1
The	1
Zidonians	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
the	1
Maonites,	1
did	1
oppress	1
you;	1
and	1
ye	1
cried	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
10:13	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:14	1
Go	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
gods	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen;	1
let	1
them	1
deliver	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
tribulation.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned:	1
do	1
thou	1
unto	1
us	1
whatsoever	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee;	1
deliver	1
us	1
only,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:17	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Gilead.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
encamped	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
begin	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon?	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
harlot:	1
and	1
Gilead	1
begat	1
Jephthah.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
Gilead's	1
wife	1
bare	1
him	1
sons;	1
and	1
his	1
wife's	1
sons	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
thrust	1
out	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
inherit	1
in	1
our	1
father's	1
house;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
woman.	1
	1
11:3	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
fled	1
from	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tob:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
gathered	1
vain	1
men	1
to	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
made	1
war	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
made	1
war	1
against	1
Israel,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
went	1
to	1
fetch	1
Jephthah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tob:	1
11:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Come,	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
captain,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
Did	1
not	1
ye	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
expel	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house?	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
distress?	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Therefore	1
we	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee	1
now,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
If	1
ye	1
bring	1
me	1
home	1
again	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
deliver	1
them	1
before	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
your	1
head?	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
witness	1
between	1
us,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
11:11	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
made	1
him	1
head	1
and	1
captain	1
over	1
them:	1
and	1
Jephthah	1
uttered	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
saying,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
against	1
me	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
my	1
land?	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Jephthah,	1
Because	1
Israel	1
took	1
away	1
my	1
land,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
Arnon	1
even	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
and	1
unto	1
Jordan:	1
now	1
therefore	1
restore	1
those	1
lands	1
again	1
peaceably.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
sent	1
messengers	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
11:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Jephthah,	1
Israel	1
took	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
nor	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon:	1
11:16	1
But	1
when	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Kadesh;	1
11:17	1
Then	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pass	1
through	1
thy	1
land:	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
thereto.	1
And	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab:	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
consent:	1
and	1
Israel	1
abode	1
in	1
Kadesh.	1
	1
11:18	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
along	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
pitched	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
but	1
came	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab:	1
for	1
Arnon	1
was	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
Israel	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon;	1
and	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
us	1
pass,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
through	1
thy	1
land	1
into	1
my	1
place.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
Sihon	1
trusted	1
not	1
Israel	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
his	1
coast:	1
but	1
Sihon	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Jahaz,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
delivered	1
Sihon	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them:	1
so	1
Israel	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
that	1
country.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
they	1
possessed	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
from	1
Arnon	1
even	1
unto	1
Jabbok,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness	1
even	1
unto	1
Jordan.	1
	1
11:23	1
So	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
dispossessed	1
the	1
Amorites	1
from	1
before	1
his	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
possess	1
it?	1
	1
11:24	1
Wilt	1
not	1
thou	1
possess	1
that	1
which	1
Chemosh	1
thy	1
god	1
giveth	1
thee	1
to	1
possess?	1
So	1
whomsoever	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
us,	1
them	1
will	1
we	1
possess.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
now	1
art	1
thou	1
any	1
thing	1
better	1
than	1
Balak	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zippor,	1
king	1
of	1
Moab?	1
did	1
he	1
ever	1
strive	1
against	1
Israel,	1
or	1
did	1
he	1
ever	1
fight	1
against	1
them,	1
11:26	1
While	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Heshbon	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
in	1
Aroer	1
and	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
be	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Arnon,	1
three	1
hundred	1
years?	1
why	1
therefore	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
recover	1
them	1
within	1
that	1
time?	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
but	1
thou	1
doest	1
me	1
wrong	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
Judge	1
be	1
judge	1
this	1
day	1
between	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:28	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Jephthah	1
which	1
he	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
from	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Gilead	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:30	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
shalt	1
without	1
fail	1
deliver	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
into	1
mine	1
hands,	1
11:31	1
Then	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
cometh	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
to	1
meet	1
me,	1
when	1
I	1
return	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
offer	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
11:32	1
So	1
Jephthah	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
even	1
till	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
Minnith,	1
even	1
twenty	1
cities,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
Thus	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
were	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
came	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
his	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
timbrels	1
and	1
with	1
dances:	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
only	1
child;	1
beside	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
neither	1
son	1
nor	1
daughter.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
daughter!	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
very	1
low,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
back.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
father,	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
opened	1
thy	1
mouth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
do	1
to	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
hath	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
vengeance	1
for	1
thee	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
father,	1
Let	1
this	1
thing	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
me:	1
let	1
me	1
alone	1
two	1
months,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
bewail	1
my	1
virginity,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
fellows.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go.	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
her	1
away	1
for	1
two	1
months:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
companions,	1
and	1
bewailed	1
her	1
virginity	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
months,	1
that	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
did	1
with	1
her	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
vow	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
vowed:	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
no	1
man.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
custom	1
in	1
Israel,	1
11:40	1
That	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
yearly	1
to	1
lament	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
a	1
year.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
northward,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jephthah,	1
Wherefore	1
passedst	1
thou	1
over	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
didst	1
not	1
call	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
thee?	1
we	1
will	1
burn	1
thine	1
house	1
upon	1
thee	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
were	1
at	1
great	1
strife	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
called	1
you,	1
ye	1
delivered	1
me	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
ye	1
delivered	1
me	1
not,	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
my	1
hand:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
me?	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
Jephthah	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead	1
smote	1
Ephraim,	1
because	1
they	1
said,	1
Ye	1
Gileadites	1
are	1
fugitives	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
among	1
the	1
Ephraimites,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
Manassites.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
Gileadites	1
took	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
Jordan	1
before	1
the	1
Ephraimites:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
those	1
Ephraimites	1
which	1
were	1
escaped	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go	1
over;	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gilead	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
an	1
Ephraimite?	1
If	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
12:6	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
now	1
Shibboleth:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
Sibboleth:	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
frame	1
to	1
pronounce	1
it	1
right.	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
passages	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Ephraimites	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
Jephthah	1
judged	1
Israel	1
six	1
years.	1
Then	1
died	1
Jephthah	1
the	1
Gileadite,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Ibzan	1
of	1
Bethlehem	1
judged	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
thirty	1
sons,	1
and	1
thirty	1
daughters,	1
whom	1
he	1
sent	1
abroad,	1
and	1
took	1
in	1
thirty	1
daughters	1
from	1
abroad	1
for	1
his	1
sons.	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
12:10	1
Then	1
died	1
Ibzan,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
at	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Elon,	1
a	1
Zebulonite,	1
judged	1
Israel;	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
Elon	1
the	1
Zebulonite	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Aijalon	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
Abdon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hillel,	1
a	1
Pirathonite,	1
judged	1
Israel.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
forty	1
sons	1
and	1
thirty	1
nephews,	1
that	1
rode	1
on	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
ass	1
colts:	1
and	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Abdon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hillel	1
the	1
Pirathonite	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Pirathon	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Zorah,	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Danites,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Manoah;	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
barren,	1
and	1
bare	1
not.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thou	1
art	1
barren,	1
and	1
bearest	1
not:	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
13:4	1
Now	1
therefore	1
beware,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
drink	1
not	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
and	1
eat	1
not	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
13:5	1
For,	1
lo,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
no	1
razor	1
shall	1
come	1
on	1
his	1
head:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
unto	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
womb:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
deliver	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
the	1
woman	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
husband,	1
saying,	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
very	1
terrible:	1
but	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
whence	1
he	1
was,	1
neither	1
told	1
he	1
me	1
his	1
name:	1
13:7	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive,	1
and	1
bear	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
now	1
drink	1
no	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
neither	1
eat	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
womb	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
13:8	1
Then	1
Manoah	1
intreated	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
let	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
teach	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
born.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
God	1
hearkened	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Manoah;	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
woman	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
but	1
Manoah	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
ran,	1
and	1
shewed	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
man	1
hath	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
Manoah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
spakest	1
unto	1
the	1
woman?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said,	1
Now	1
let	1
thy	1
words	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
order	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Manoah,	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman	1
let	1
her	1
beware.	1
	1
13:14	1
She	1
may	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
neither	1
let	1
her	1
drink	1
wine	1
or	1
strong	1
drink,	1
nor	1
eat	1
any	1
unclean	1
thing:	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
her	1
let	1
her	1
observe.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
us	1
detain	1
thee,	1
until	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
made	1
ready	1
a	1
kid	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Manoah,	1
Though	1
thou	1
detain	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
thy	1
bread:	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
offer	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
thou	1
must	1
offer	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
For	1
Manoah	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name,	1
that	1
when	1
thy	1
sayings	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
we	1
may	1
do	1
thee	1
honour?	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
thus	1
after	1
my	1
name,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
secret?	1
	1
13:19	1
So	1
Manoah	1
took	1
a	1
kid	1
with	1
a	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
upon	1
a	1
rock	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
did	1
wonderously;	1
and	1
Manoah	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
on.	1
	1
13:20	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
flame	1
went	1
up	1
toward	1
heaven	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
altar,	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
ascended	1
in	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
And	1
Manoah	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
looked	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
appear	1
to	1
Manoah	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
Then	1
Manoah	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
Manoah	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
We	1
shall	1
surely	1
die,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
his	1
wife	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
kill	1
us,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
at	1
our	1
hands,	1
neither	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
shewed	1
us	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
nor	1
would	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
told	1
us	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
these.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Samson:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
him	1
at	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Dan	1
between	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
Samson	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
Timnath	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
Timnath	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
now	1
therefore	1
get	1
her	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
14:3	1
Then	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
there	1
never	1
a	1
woman	1
among	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
or	1
among	1
all	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistines?	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
Get	1
her	1
for	1
me;	1
for	1
she	1
pleaseth	1
me	1
well.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
sought	1
an	1
occasion	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:5	1
Then	1
went	1
Samson	1
down,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
to	1
Timnath,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
vineyards	1
of	1
Timnath:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
roared	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
mightily	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
rent	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
rent	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
woman;	1
and	1
she	1
pleased	1
Samson	1
well.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
take	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
bees	1
and	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
thereof	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
eating,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat:	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
honey	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
14:10	1
So	1
his	1
father	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
woman:	1
and	1
Samson	1
made	1
there	1
a	1
feast;	1
for	1
so	1
used	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
thirty	1
companions	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
riddle	1
unto	1
you:	1
if	1
ye	1
can	1
certainly	1
declare	1
it	1
me	1
within	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
and	1
find	1
it	1
out,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
thirty	1
sheets	1
and	1
thirty	1
change	1
of	1
garments:	1
14:13	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
cannot	1
declare	1
it	1
me,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
give	1
me	1
thirty	1
sheets	1
and	1
thirty	1
change	1
of	1
garments.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
forth	1
thy	1
riddle,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
eater	1
came	1
forth	1
meat,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
strong	1
came	1
forth	1
sweetness.	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
expound	1
the	1
riddle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson's	1
wife,	1
Entice	1
thy	1
husband,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
declare	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
riddle,	1
lest	1
we	1
burn	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house	1
with	1
fire:	1
have	1
ye	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
we	1
have?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so?	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
Samson's	1
wife	1
wept	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
dost	1
but	1
hate	1
me,	1
and	1
lovest	1
me	1
not:	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
riddle	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
told	1
it	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
told	1
it	1
my	1
father	1
nor	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
I	1
tell	1
it	1
thee?	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
she	1
wept	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
seven	1
days,	1
while	1
their	1
feast	1
lasted:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
lay	1
sore	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
riddle	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
her	1
people.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down,	1
What	1
is	1
sweeter	1
than	1
honey?	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
lion?	1
	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
plowed	1
with	1
my	1
heifer,	1
ye	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
out	1
my	1
riddle.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
slew	1
thirty	1
men	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
spoil,	1
and	1
gave	1
change	1
of	1
garments	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
expounded	1
the	1
riddle.	1
And	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
14:20	1
But	1
Samson's	1
wife	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
companion,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
as	1
his	1
friend.	1
	1
15:1	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
within	1
a	1
while	1
after,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest,	1
that	1
Samson	1
visited	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
kid;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
into	1
the	1
chamber.	1
But	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
her	1
father	1
said,	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
that	1
thou	1
hadst	1
utterly	1
hated	1
her;	1
therefore	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
thy	1
companion:	1
is	1
not	1
her	1
younger	1
sister	1
fairer	1
than	1
she?	1
take	1
her,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
instead	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
concerning	1
them,	1
Now	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
more	1
blameless	1
than	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
them	1
a	1
displeasure.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Samson	1
went	1
and	1
caught	1
three	1
hundred	1
foxes,	1
and	1
took	1
firebrands,	1
and	1
turned	1
tail	1
to	1
tail,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
firebrand	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
between	1
two	1
tails.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
brands	1
on	1
fire,	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
standing	1
corn	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
burnt	1
up	1
both	1
the	1
shocks,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
standing	1
corn,	1
with	1
the	1
vineyards	1
and	1
olives.	1
	1
15:6	1
Then	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Who	1
hath	1
done	1
this?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Samson,	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Timnite,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
burnt	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
this,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
avenged	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cease.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
hip	1
and	1
thigh	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Etam.	1
	1
15:9	1
Then	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
Lehi.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
said,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
To	1
bind	1
Samson	1
are	1
we	1
come	1
up,	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
15:11	1
Then	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
Etam,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Samson,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
are	1
rulers	1
over	1
us?	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
us?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
bind	1
thee,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
fall	1
upon	1
me	1
yourselves.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
No;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
bind	1
thee	1
fast,	1
and	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
their	1
hand:	1
but	1
surely	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
kill	1
thee.	1
And	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
two	1
new	1
cords,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
rock.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
Lehi,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
shouted	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
mightily	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
cords	1
that	1
were	1
upon	1
his	1
arms	1
became	1
as	1
flax	1
that	1
was	1
burnt	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
bands	1
loosed	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
new	1
jawbone	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
slew	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
therewith.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Samson	1
said,	1
With	1
the	1
jawbone	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
heaps	1
upon	1
heaps,	1
with	1
the	1
jaw	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
have	1
I	1
slain	1
a	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking,	1
that	1
he	1
cast	1
away	1
the	1
jawbone	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Ramathlehi.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
athirst,	1
and	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
given	1
this	1
great	1
deliverance	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
servant:	1
and	1
now	1
shall	1
I	1
die	1
for	1
thirst,	1
and	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised?	1
	1
15:19	1
But	1
God	1
clave	1
an	1
hollow	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
jaw,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
water	1
thereout;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
his	1
spirit	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
revived:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Enhakkore,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Lehi	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
went	1
Samson	1
to	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
saw	1
there	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
Gazites,	1
saying,	1
Samson	1
is	1
come	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
compassed	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
were	1
quiet	1
all	1
the	1
night,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
day,	1
we	1
shall	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
Samson	1
lay	1
till	1
midnight,	1
and	1
arose	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
posts,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
bar	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Hebron.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Sorek,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Delilah.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Entice	1
him,	1
and	1
see	1
wherein	1
his	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
we	1
may	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
bind	1
him	1
to	1
afflict	1
him;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
to	1
Samson,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
wherein	1
thy	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth,	1
and	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
afflict	1
thee.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
they	1
bind	1
me	1
with	1
seven	1
green	1
withs	1
that	1
were	1
never	1
dried,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
16:8	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
brought	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
seven	1
green	1
withs	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dried,	1
and	1
she	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:9	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
men	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
abiding	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
chamber.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
withs,	1
as	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
tow	1
is	1
broken	1
when	1
it	1
toucheth	1
the	1
fire.	1
So	1
his	1
strength	1
was	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
lies:	1
now	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
they	1
bind	1
me	1
fast	1
with	1
new	1
ropes	1
that	1
never	1
were	1
occupied,	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
as	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
16:12	1
Delilah	1
therefore	1
took	1
new	1
ropes,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
therewith,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
chamber.	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
them	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
arms	1
like	1
a	1
thread.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
Delilah	1
said	1
unto	1
Samson,	1
Hitherto	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
lies:	1
tell	1
me	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
bound.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
weavest	1
the	1
seven	1
locks	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
web.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
she	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
pin,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
awaked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
pin	1
of	1
the	1
beam,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
web.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
canst	1
thou	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
thee,	1
when	1
thine	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me?	1
thou	1
hast	1
mocked	1
me	1
these	1
three	1
times,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
wherein	1
thy	1
great	1
strength	1
lieth.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
she	1
pressed	1
him	1
daily	1
with	1
her	1
words,	1
and	1
urged	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
vexed	1
unto	1
death;	1
16:17	1
That	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
hath	1
not	1
come	1
a	1
razor	1
upon	1
mine	1
head;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
Nazarite	1
unto	1
God	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb:	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
shaven,	1
then	1
my	1
strength	1
will	1
go	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
become	1
weak,	1
and	1
be	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
man.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
when	1
Delilah	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
she	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
up	1
this	1
once,	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
all	1
his	1
heart.	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
brought	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
she	1
made	1
him	1
sleep	1
upon	1
her	1
knees;	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
she	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
shave	1
off	1
the	1
seven	1
locks	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
afflict	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
strength	1
went	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Samson.	1
And	1
he	1
awoke	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
before,	1
and	1
shake	1
myself.	1
And	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
16:21	1
But	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
fetters	1
of	1
brass;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
grind	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
house.	1
	1
16:22	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
again	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
shaven.	1
	1
16:23	1
Then	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
great	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
Dagon	1
their	1
god,	1
and	1
to	1
rejoice:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Our	1
god	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Samson	1
our	1
enemy	1
into	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
praised	1
their	1
god:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Our	1
god	1
hath	1
delivered	1
into	1
our	1
hands	1
our	1
enemy,	1
and	1
the	1
destroyer	1
of	1
our	1
country,	1
which	1
slew	1
many	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
merry,	1
that	1
they	1
said,	1
Call	1
for	1
Samson,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
make	1
us	1
sport.	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
for	1
Samson	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
sport:	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
between	1
the	1
pillars.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
Samson	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
lad	1
that	1
held	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
Suffer	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
feel	1
the	1
pillars	1
whereupon	1
the	1
house	1
standeth,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
lean	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
16:27	1
Now	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
there;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
roof	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
that	1
beheld	1
while	1
Samson	1
made	1
sport.	1
	1
16:28	1
And	1
Samson	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
God,	1
remember	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
only	1
this	1
once,	1
O	1
God,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
avenged	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
for	1
my	1
two	1
eyes.	1
	1
16:29	1
And	1
Samson	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
middle	1
pillars	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
house	1
stood,	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
borne	1
up,	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
Samson	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
die	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
lords,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein.	1
So	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
he	1
slew	1
at	1
his	1
death	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
which	1
he	1
slew	1
in	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
16:31	1
Then	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
between	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol	1
in	1
the	1
buryingplace	1
of	1
Manoah	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
The	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
from	1
thee,	1
about	1
which	1
thou	1
cursedst,	1
and	1
spakest	1
of	1
also	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
behold,	1
the	1
silver	1
is	1
with	1
me;	1
I	1
took	1
it.	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
the	1
eleven	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
his	1
mother	1
said,	1
I	1
had	1
wholly	1
dedicated	1
the	1
silver	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
my	1
hand	1
for	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image:	1
now	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
17:4	1
Yet	1
he	1
restored	1
the	1
money	1
unto	1
his	1
mother;	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
took	1
two	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
founder,	1
who	1
made	1
thereof	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
Micah	1
had	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
consecrated	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
who	1
became	1
his	1
priest.	1
	1
17:6	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Judah,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
he	1
sojourned	1
there.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
to	1
sojourn	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
place:	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
Micah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Levite	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
sojourn	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
a	1
place.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
Micah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dwell	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
be	1
unto	1
me	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
a	1
priest,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
ten	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
by	1
the	1
year,	1
and	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
apparel,	1
and	1
thy	1
victuals.	1
So	1
the	1
Levite	1
went	1
in.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
Levite	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
Micah	1
consecrated	1
the	1
Levite;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
became	1
his	1
priest,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
17:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Micah,	1
Now	1
know	1
I	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
good,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
Levite	1
to	1
my	1
priest.	1
	1
18:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
the	1
Danites	1
sought	1
them	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
dwell	1
in;	1
for	1
unto	1
that	1
day	1
all	1
their	1
inheritance	1
had	1
not	1
fallen	1
unto	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
sent	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
five	1
men	1
from	1
their	1
coasts,	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
from	1
Zorah,	1
and	1
from	1
Eshtaol,	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
search	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go,	1
search	1
the	1
land:	1
who	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
they	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
18:3	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
they	1
knew	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
the	1
Levite:	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
in	1
thither,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
brought	1
thee	1
hither?	1
and	1
what	1
makest	1
thou	1
in	1
this	1
place?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
here?	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
dealeth	1
Micah	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
hired	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
priest.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ask	1
counsel,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
whether	1
our	1
way	1
which	1
we	1
go	1
shall	1
be	1
prosperous.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace:	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
your	1
way	1
wherein	1
ye	1
go.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Laish,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
how	1
they	1
dwelt	1
careless,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
quiet	1
and	1
secure;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
magistrate	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
might	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
shame	1
in	1
any	1
thing;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
with	1
any	1
man.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
Zorah	1
and	1
Eshtaol:	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
say	1
ye?	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
land,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good:	1
and	1
are	1
ye	1
still?	1
be	1
not	1
slothful	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
18:10	1
When	1
ye	1
go,	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
secure,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
land:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
hands;	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Danites,	1
out	1
of	1
Zorah	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Eshtaol,	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
appointed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
in	1
Judah:	1
wherefore	1
they	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Mahanehdan	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
behind	1
Kirjathjearim.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
they	1
passed	1
thence	1
unto	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah.	1
	1
18:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Laish,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren,	1
Do	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
these	1
houses	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
a	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
a	1
molten	1
image?	1
now	1
therefore	1
consider	1
what	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
thitherward,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
the	1
Levite,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
and	1
saluted	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
appointed	1
with	1
their	1
weapons	1
of	1
war,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan,	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
five	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
thither,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image:	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
with	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
appointed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
these	1
went	1
into	1
Micah's	1
house,	1
and	1
fetched	1
the	1
carved	1
image,	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
priest	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
do	1
ye?	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
lay	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
be	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
a	1
priest:	1
is	1
it	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
man,	1
or	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
unto	1
a	1
tribe	1
and	1
a	1
family	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
the	1
priest's	1
heart	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
ephod,	1
and	1
the	1
teraphim,	1
and	1
the	1
graven	1
image,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:21	1
So	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
and	1
the	1
cattle	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Micah,	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
near	1
to	1
Micah's	1
house	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan.	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Micah,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
comest	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
company?	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
gods	1
which	1
I	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
away:	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
more?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee?	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
voice	1
be	1
heard	1
among	1
us,	1
lest	1
angry	1
fellows	1
run	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
lose	1
thy	1
life,	1
with	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
household.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
went	1
their	1
way:	1
and	1
when	1
Micah	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
unto	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Micah	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
priest	1
which	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Laish,	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
quiet	1
and	1
secure:	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
burnt	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
deliverer,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
with	1
any	1
man;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
that	1
lieth	1
by	1
Bethrehob.	1
And	1
they	1
built	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
Dan,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Dan	1
their	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
born	1
unto	1
Israel:	1
howbeit	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
Laish	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Dan	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
graven	1
image:	1
and	1
Jonathan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gershom,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
priests	1
to	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Dan	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
Micah's	1
graven	1
image,	1
which	1
he	1
made,	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
Levite	1
sojourning	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
who	1
took	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
concubine	1
out	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
his	1
concubine	1
played	1
the	1
whore	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
unto	1
her	1
father's	1
house	1
to	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
four	1
whole	1
months.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
her,	1
to	1
speak	1
friendly	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
again,	1
having	1
his	1
servant	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
asses:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
damsel	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father,	1
retained	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
three	1
days:	1
so	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart:	1
and	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
Comfort	1
thine	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
afterward	1
go	1
your	1
way.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
together:	1
for	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Be	1
content,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
tarry	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart,	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
urged	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
lodged	1
there	1
again.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
day	1
to	1
depart;	1
and	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father	1
said,	1
Comfort	1
thine	1
heart,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
And	1
they	1
tarried	1
until	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
depart,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
his	1
servant,	1
his	1
father	1
in	1
law,	1
the	1
damsel's	1
father,	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
now	1
the	1
day	1
draweth	1
toward	1
evening,	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
tarry	1
all	1
night:	1
behold,	1
the	1
day	1
groweth	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
lodge	1
here,	1
that	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
merry;	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
get	1
you	1
early	1
on	1
your	1
way,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
home.	1
	1
19:10	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
tarry	1
that	1
night,	1
but	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
over	1
against	1
Jebus,	1
which	1
is	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
asses	1
saddled,	1
his	1
concubine	1
also	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
Jebus,	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
far	1
spent;	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
master,	1
Come,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
turn	1
in	1
into	1
this	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
hither	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
to	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
places	1
to	1
lodge	1
all	1
night,	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
or	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
they	1
passed	1
on	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
Gibeah,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
aside	1
thither,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
to	1
lodge	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
he	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
took	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
lodging.	1
	1
19:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
work	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
even,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim;	1
and	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
but	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
were	1
Benjamites.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
passing	1
from	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
toward	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim;	1
from	1
thence	1
am	1
I:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
to	1
house.	1
	1
19:19	1
Yet	1
there	1
is	1
both	1
straw	1
and	1
provender	1
for	1
our	1
asses;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
bread	1
and	1
wine	1
also	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
thy	1
servants:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
howsoever	1
let	1
all	1
thy	1
wants	1
lie	1
upon	1
me;	1
only	1
lodge	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
19:21	1
So	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
provender	1
unto	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
19:22	1
Now	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
their	1
hearts	1
merry,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
certain	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial,	1
beset	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
beat	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
nay,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
wickedly;	1
seeing	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
mine	1
house,	1
do	1
not	1
this	1
folly.	1
	1
19:24	1
Behold,	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
daughter	1
a	1
maiden,	1
and	1
his	1
concubine;	1
them	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
humble	1
ye	1
them,	1
and	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
what	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
unto	1
this	1
man	1
do	1
not	1
so	1
vile	1
a	1
thing.	1
	1
19:25	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
him:	1
so	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
forth	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
her,	1
and	1
abused	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
until	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
spring,	1
they	1
let	1
her	1
go.	1
	1
19:26	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
house	1
where	1
her	1
lord	1
was,	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
light.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
her	1
lord	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
go	1
his	1
way:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
woman	1
his	1
concubine	1
was	1
fallen	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
threshold.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Up,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
going.	1
But	1
none	1
answered.	1
	1
Then	1
the	1
man	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
knife,	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
his	1
concubine,	1
and	1
divided	1
her,	1
together	1
with	1
her	1
bones,	1
into	1
twelve	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
said,	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
deed	1
done	1
nor	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
consider	1
of	1
it,	1
take	1
advice,	1
and	1
speak	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
20:1	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen	1
that	1
drew	1
sword.	1
	1
20:3	1
(Now	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Mizpeh.)	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
how	1
was	1
this	1
wickedness?	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
the	1
Levite,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
slain,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Gibeah	1
that	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Benjamin,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
concubine,	1
to	1
lodge.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
rose	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
beset	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
me	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
have	1
slain	1
me:	1
and	1
my	1
concubine	1
have	1
they	1
forced,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
concubine,	1
and	1
cut	1
her	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
lewdness	1
and	1
folly	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:7	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
give	1
here	1
your	1
advice	1
and	1
counsel.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
arose	1
as	1
one	1
man,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
tent,	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
turn	1
into	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
20:9	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
Gibeah;	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
up	1
by	1
lot	1
against	1
it;	1
20:10	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
an	1
hundred	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
a	1
thousand,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
to	1
fetch	1
victual	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do,	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
folly	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
wrought	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:11	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
knit	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
men	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
saying,	1
What	1
wickedness	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
among	1
you?	1
20:13	1
Now	1
therefore	1
deliver	1
us	1
the	1
men,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
put	1
away	1
evil	1
from	1
Israel.	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
unto	1
Gibeah,	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
numbered	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
twenty	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword,	1
beside	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gibeah,	1
which	1
were	1
numbered	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
men.	1
	1
20:16	1
Among	1
all	1
this	1
people	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chosen	1
men	1
lefthanded;	1
every	1
one	1
could	1
sling	1
stones	1
at	1
an	1
hair	1
breadth,	1
and	1
not	1
miss.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
beside	1
Benjamin,	1
were	1
numbered	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
war.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
Which	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Judah	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
first.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
Benjamin;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
at	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Gibeah,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
day	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
encouraged	1
themselves,	1
and	1
set	1
their	1
battle	1
again	1
in	1
array	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
the	1
first	1
day.	1
	1
20:23	1
(And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
wept	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
my	1
brother?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
him.)	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
near	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
the	1
second	1
day.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
Benjamin	1
went	1
forth	1
against	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
the	1
second	1
day,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
again	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men;	1
all	1
these	1
drew	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:26	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wept,	1
and	1
sat	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
fasted	1
that	1
day	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
(for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
20:28	1
And	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
stood	1
before	1
it	1
in	1
those	1
days,)	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
yet	1
again	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
my	1
brother,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
cease?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Go	1
up;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
Israel	1
set	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
round	1
about	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
Gibeah,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
were	1
drawn	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
smite	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
kill,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
in	1
the	1
highways,	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
goeth	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
about	1
thirty	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
smitten	1
down	1
before	1
us,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
flee,	1
and	1
draw	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
unto	1
the	1
highways.	1
	1
20:33	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
rose	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
Baaltamar:	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places,	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
meadows	1
of	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
against	1
Gibeah	1
ten	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
sore:	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
evil	1
was	1
near	1
them.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
Benjamin	1
before	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
that	1
day	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
thousand	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
men:	1
all	1
these	1
drew	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:36	1
So	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
Benjamites,	1
because	1
they	1
trusted	1
unto	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
beside	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
hasted,	1
and	1
rushed	1
upon	1
Gibeah;	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait	1
drew	1
themselves	1
along,	1
and	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
20:38	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
appointed	1
sign	1
between	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
liers	1
in	1
wait,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
great	1
flame	1
with	1
smoke	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:39	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
retired	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
Benjamin	1
began	1
to	1
smite	1
and	1
kill	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
about	1
thirty	1
persons:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Surely	1
they	1
are	1
smitten	1
down	1
before	1
us,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
battle.	1
	1
20:40	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
flame	1
began	1
to	1
arise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
smoke,	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
looked	1
behind	1
them,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
amazed:	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
evil	1
was	1
come	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:42	1
Therefore	1
they	1
turned	1
their	1
backs	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
but	1
the	1
battle	1
overtook	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
they	1
destroyed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
20:43	1
Thus	1
they	1
inclosed	1
the	1
Benjamites	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
chased	1
them,	1
and	1
trode	1
them	1
down	1
with	1
ease	1
over	1
against	1
Gibeah	1
toward	1
the	1
sunrising.	1
	1
20:44	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men;	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
20:45	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
Rimmon:	1
and	1
they	1
gleaned	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
highways	1
five	1
thousand	1
men;	1
and	1
pursued	1
hard	1
after	1
them	1
unto	1
Gidom,	1
and	1
slew	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
20:46	1
So	1
that	1
all	1
which	1
fell	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
the	1
sword;	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
20:47	1
But	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
turned	1
and	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
unto	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon	1
four	1
months.	1
	1
20:48	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
turned	1
again	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
hand:	1
also	1
they	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
to.	1
	1
21:1	1
Now	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
sworn	1
in	1
Mizpeh,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
give	1
his	1
daughter	1
unto	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
abode	1
there	1
till	1
even	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
wept	1
sore;	1
21:3	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
is	1
this	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
day	1
one	1
tribe	1
lacking	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
congregation	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD?	1
For	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
oath	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
saying,	1
He	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
repented	1
them	1
for	1
Benjamin	1
their	1
brother,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
tribe	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Israel	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
21:7	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
wives	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
remain,	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
of	1
our	1
daughters	1
to	1
wives?	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
one	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
to	1
the	1
LORD?	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
none	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
Jabeshgilead	1
to	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
21:9	1
For	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
numbered,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
there.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
the	1
congregation	1
sent	1
thither	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
valiantest,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
every	1
male,	1
and	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
lain	1
by	1
man.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
four	1
hundred	1
young	1
virgins,	1
that	1
had	1
known	1
no	1
man	1
by	1
lying	1
with	1
any	1
male:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
Shiloh,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
sent	1
some	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
rock	1
Rimmon,	1
and	1
to	1
call	1
peaceably	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
Benjamin	1
came	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
time;	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
wives	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
saved	1
alive	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead:	1
and	1
yet	1
so	1
they	1
sufficed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
repented	1
them	1
for	1
Benjamin,	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:16	1
Then	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
wives	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
remain,	1
seeing	1
the	1
women	1
are	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
escaped	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
that	1
a	1
tribe	1
be	1
not	1
destroyed	1
out	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:18	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
our	1
daughters:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
sworn,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
21:19	1
Then	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
yearly	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
Bethel,	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
highway	1
that	1
goeth	1
up	1
from	1
Bethel	1
to	1
Shechem,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Lebonah.	1
	1
21:20	1
Therefore	1
they	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
vineyards;	1
21:21	1
And	1
see,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Shiloh	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
dances,	1
then	1
come	1
ye	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
catch	1
you	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
their	1
fathers	1
or	1
their	1
brethren	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
to	1
complain,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
favourable	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
our	1
sakes:	1
because	1
we	1
reserved	1
not	1
to	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
war:	1
for	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
guilty.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
wives,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
number,	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
danced,	1
whom	1
they	1
caught:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
unto	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
repaired	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
departed	1
thence	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tribe	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
21:25	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Israel:	1
every	1
man	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Ruth	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
the	1
judges	1
ruled,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah	1
went	1
to	1
sojourn	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
Elimelech,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
Naomi,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
sons	1
Mahlon	1
and	1
Chilion,	1
Ephrathites	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
continued	1
there.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
Elimelech	1
Naomi's	1
husband	1
died;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
Moab;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Orpah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Ruth:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelled	1
there	1
about	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
Mahlon	1
and	1
Chilion	1
died	1
also	1
both	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
sons	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
1:6	1
Then	1
she	1
arose	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
in	1
law,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
visited	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
giving	1
them	1
bread.	1
	1
1:7	1
Wherefore	1
she	1
went	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
daughters	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
two	1
daughters	1
in	1
law,	1
Go,	1
return	1
each	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
house:	1
the	1
LORD	1
deal	1
kindly	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
LORD	1
grant	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
find	1
rest,	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
Then	1
she	1
kissed	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Surely	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
with	1
thee	1
unto	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said,	1
Turn	1
again,	1
my	1
daughters:	1
why	1
will	1
ye	1
go	1
with	1
me?	1
are	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
more	1
sons	1
in	1
my	1
womb,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
your	1
husbands?	1
	1
1:12	1
Turn	1
again,	1
my	1
daughters,	1
go	1
your	1
way;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
old	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
husband.	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
hope,	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
husband	1
also	1
to	1
night,	1
and	1
should	1
also	1
bear	1
sons;	1
1:13	1
Would	1
ye	1
tarry	1
for	1
them	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
grown?	1
would	1
ye	1
stay	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
having	1
husbands?	1
nay,	1
my	1
daughters;	1
for	1
it	1
grieveth	1
me	1
much	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept	1
again:	1
and	1
Orpah	1
kissed	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law;	1
but	1
Ruth	1
clave	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
sister	1
in	1
law	1
is	1
gone	1
back	1
unto	1
her	1
people,	1
and	1
unto	1
her	1
gods:	1
return	1
thou	1
after	1
thy	1
sister	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
Ruth	1
said,	1
Intreat	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
thee,	1
or	1
to	1
return	1
from	1
following	1
after	1
thee:	1
for	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest,	1
I	1
will	1
go;	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
lodgest,	1
I	1
will	1
lodge:	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
God	1
my	1
God:	1
1:17	1
Where	1
thou	1
diest,	1
will	1
I	1
die,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
buried:	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
ought	1
but	1
death	1
part	1
thee	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
stedfastly	1
minded	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her,	1
then	1
she	1
left	1
speaking	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
1:19	1
So	1
they	1
two	1
went	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bethlehem,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
Naomi?	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Call	1
me	1
not	1
Naomi,	1
call	1
me	1
Mara:	1
for	1
the	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
dealt	1
very	1
bitterly	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
1:21	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
full	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
brought	1
me	1
home	1
again	1
empty:	1
why	1
then	1
call	1
ye	1
me	1
Naomi,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
testified	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
Almighty	1
hath	1
afflicted	1
me?	1
	1
1:22	1
So	1
Naomi	1
returned,	1
and	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
with	1
her,	1
which	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
barley	1
harvest.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Naomi	1
had	1
a	1
kinsman	1
of	1
her	1
husband's,	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
wealth,	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Elimelech;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Boaz.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess	1
said	1
unto	1
Naomi,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
glean	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
after	1
him	1
in	1
whose	1
sight	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
grace.	1
	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go,	1
my	1
daughter.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
gleaned	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
after	1
the	1
reapers:	1
and	1
her	1
hap	1
was	1
to	1
light	1
on	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
belonging	1
unto	1
Boaz,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
Elimelech.	1
	1
2:4	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Boaz	1
came	1
from	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
reapers,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
bless	1
thee.	1
	1
2:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
reapers,	1
Whose	1
damsel	1
is	1
this?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
reapers	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Moabitish	1
damsel	1
that	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
Naomi	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab:	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
let	1
me	1
glean	1
and	1
gather	1
after	1
the	1
reapers	1
among	1
the	1
sheaves:	1
so	1
she	1
came,	1
and	1
hath	1
continued	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
until	1
now,	1
that	1
she	1
tarried	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
2:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz	1
unto	1
Ruth,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
not,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
Go	1
not	1
to	1
glean	1
in	1
another	1
field,	1
neither	1
go	1
from	1
hence,	1
but	1
abide	1
here	1
fast	1
by	1
my	1
maidens:	1
2:9	1
Let	1
thine	1
eyes	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
reap,	1
and	1
go	1
thou	1
after	1
them:	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
charged	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
touch	1
thee?	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
athirst,	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
drawn.	1
	1
2:10	1
Then	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
have	1
I	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
me,	1
seeing	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger?	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
Boaz	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
It	1
hath	1
fully	1
been	1
shewed	1
me,	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
thy	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
thine	1
husband:	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
nativity,	1
and	1
art	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not	1
heretofore.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
recompense	1
thy	1
work,	1
and	1
a	1
full	1
reward	1
be	1
given	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
under	1
whose	1
wings	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
to	1
trust.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord;	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
comforted	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
friendly	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
like	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaidens.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Boaz	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
At	1
mealtime	1
come	1
thou	1
hither,	1
and	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
bread,	1
and	1
dip	1
thy	1
morsel	1
in	1
the	1
vinegar.	1
And	1
she	1
sat	1
beside	1
the	1
reapers:	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
her	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
was	1
sufficed,	1
and	1
left.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
risen	1
up	1
to	1
glean,	1
Boaz	1
commanded	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
her	1
glean	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
sheaves,	1
and	1
reproach	1
her	1
not:	1
2:16	1
And	1
let	1
fall	1
also	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
handfuls	1
of	1
purpose	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
leave	1
them,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
glean	1
them,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
2:17	1
So	1
she	1
gleaned	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
until	1
even,	1
and	1
beat	1
out	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
gleaned:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
barley.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
saw	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
gleaned:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
forth,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
reserved	1
after	1
she	1
was	1
sufficed.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Where	1
hast	1
thou	1
gleaned	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
and	1
where	1
wroughtest	1
thou?	1
blessed	1
be	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
thee.	1
And	1
she	1
shewed	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
wrought,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
man's	1
name	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
wrought	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
Boaz.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
off	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
dead.	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
man	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
unto	1
us,	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
next	1
kinsmen.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess	1
said,	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
also,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
keep	1
fast	1
by	1
my	1
young	1
men,	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
ended	1
all	1
my	1
harvest.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
Naomi	1
said	1
unto	1
Ruth	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
It	1
is	1
good,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
that	1
thou	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
maidens,	1
that	1
they	1
meet	1
thee	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
field.	1
	1
2:23	1
So	1
she	1
kept	1
fast	1
by	1
the	1
maidens	1
of	1
Boaz	1
to	1
glean	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
barley	1
harvest	1
and	1
of	1
wheat	1
harvest;	1
and	1
dwelt	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
Naomi	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
My	1
daughter,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
seek	1
rest	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
Boaz	1
of	1
our	1
kindred,	1
with	1
whose	1
maidens	1
thou	1
wast?	1
	1
Behold,	1
he	1
winnoweth	1
barley	1
to	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor.	1
	1
3:3	1
Wash	1
thyself	1
therefore,	1
and	1
anoint	1
thee,	1
and	1
put	1
thy	1
raiment	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor:	1
but	1
make	1
not	1
thyself	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
until	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
lieth	1
down,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
mark	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
shall	1
lie,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
in,	1
and	1
uncover	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
lay	1
thee	1
down;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
All	1
that	1
thou	1
sayest	1
unto	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
bade	1
her.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
when	1
Boaz	1
had	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
merry,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
corn:	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
softly,	1
and	1
uncovered	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
down.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
midnight,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
turned	1
himself:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
Ruth	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
spread	1
therefore	1
thy	1
skirt	1
over	1
thine	1
handmaid;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
near	1
kinsman.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
my	1
daughter:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
more	1
kindness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
followedst	1
not	1
young	1
men,	1
whether	1
poor	1
or	1
rich.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
now,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
fear	1
not;	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
requirest:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
virtuous	1
woman.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
near	1
kinsman:	1
howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kinsman	1
nearer	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
3:13	1
Tarry	1
this	1
night,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
perform	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman,	1
well;	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
the	1
kinsman's	1
part:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman	1
to	1
thee,	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
kinsman	1
to	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth:	1
lie	1
down	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
she	1
lay	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
until	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
one	1
could	1
know	1
another.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
3:15	1
Also	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
the	1
vail	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
hold	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
held	1
it,	1
he	1
measured	1
six	1
measures	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law,	1
she	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
And	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
These	1
six	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
gave	1
he	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
Go	1
not	1
empty	1
unto	1
thy	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
3:18	1
Then	1
said	1
she,	1
Sit	1
still,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
until	1
thou	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
will	1
fall:	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
rest,	1
until	1
he	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
thing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
went	1
Boaz	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
there:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
kinsman	1
of	1
whom	1
Boaz	1
spake	1
came	1
by;	1
unto	1
whom	1
he	1
said,	1
Ho,	1
such	1
a	1
one!	1
turn	1
aside,	1
sit	1
down	1
here.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
ten	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
down	1
here.	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
kinsman,	1
Naomi,	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Moab,	1
selleth	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
land,	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
brother	1
Elimelech's:	1
4:4	1
And	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
advertise	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Buy	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
redeem	1
it,	1
redeem	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
redeem	1
it,	1
then	1
tell	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
redeem	1
it	1
beside	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
after	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Boaz,	1
What	1
day	1
thou	1
buyest	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Naomi,	1
thou	1
must	1
buy	1
it	1
also	1
of	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
upon	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
kinsman	1
said,	1
I	1
cannot	1
redeem	1
it	1
for	1
myself,	1
lest	1
I	1
mar	1
mine	1
own	1
inheritance:	1
redeem	1
thou	1
my	1
right	1
to	1
thyself;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
redeem	1
it.	1
	1
4:7	1
Now	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
former	1
time	1
in	1
Israel	1
concerning	1
redeeming	1
and	1
concerning	1
changing,	1
for	1
to	1
confirm	1
all	1
things;	1
a	1
man	1
plucked	1
off	1
his	1
shoe,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
testimony	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
kinsman	1
said	1
unto	1
Boaz,	1
Buy	1
it	1
for	1
thee.	1
So	1
he	1
drew	1
off	1
his	1
shoe.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
Boaz	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
Elimelech's,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
Chilion's	1
and	1
Mahlon's,	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Naomi.	1
	1
4:10	1
Moreover	1
Ruth	1
the	1
Moabitess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mahlon,	1
have	1
I	1
purchased	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
wife,	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
upon	1
his	1
inheritance,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
be	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
his	1
place:	1
ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
said,	1
We	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
thine	1
house	1
like	1
Rachel	1
and	1
like	1
Leah,	1
which	1
two	1
did	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
worthily	1
in	1
Ephratah,	1
and	1
be	1
famous	1
in	1
Bethlehem:	1
4:12	1
And	1
let	1
thy	1
house	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Pharez,	1
whom	1
Tamar	1
bare	1
unto	1
Judah,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
woman.	1
	1
4:13	1
So	1
Boaz	1
took	1
Ruth,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
her	1
conception,	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
said	1
unto	1
Naomi,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
without	1
a	1
kinsman,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
famous	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
restorer	1
of	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
a	1
nourisher	1
of	1
thine	1
old	1
age:	1
for	1
thy	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
which	1
loveth	1
thee,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
seven	1
sons,	1
hath	1
born	1
him.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
Naomi	1
took	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
became	1
nurse	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
her	1
neighbours	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
name,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
born	1
to	1
Naomi;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Obed:	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
generations	1
of	1
Pharez:	1
Pharez	1
begat	1
Hezron,	1
4:19	1
And	1
Hezron	1
begat	1
Ram,	1
and	1
Ram	1
begat	1
Amminadab,	1
4:20	1
And	1
Amminadab	1
begat	1
Nahshon,	1
and	1
Nahshon	1
begat	1
Salmon,	1
4:21	1
And	1
Salmon	1
begat	1
Boaz,	1
and	1
Boaz	1
begat	1
Obed,	1
4:22	1
And	1
Obed	1
begat	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
Jesse	1
begat	1
David.	1
	1

	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
Samuel	1
	1
Otherwise	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
Ramathaimzophim,	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Elkanah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroham,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elihu,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tohu,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zuph,	1
an	1
Ephrathite:	1
1:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
wives;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Hannah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Peninnah:	1
and	1
Peninnah	1
had	1
children,	1
but	1
Hannah	1
had	1
no	1
children.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
city	1
yearly	1
to	1
worship	1
and	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
were	1
there.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
that	1
Elkanah	1
offered,	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
Peninnah	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
sons	1
and	1
her	1
daughters,	1
portions:	1
1:5	1
But	1
unto	1
Hannah	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
worthy	1
portion;	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
Hannah:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shut	1
up	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
her	1
adversary	1
also	1
provoked	1
her	1
sore,	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
fret,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shut	1
up	1
her	1
womb.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
year	1
by	1
year,	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
so	1
she	1
provoked	1
her;	1
therefore	1
she	1
wept,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
eat.	1
	1
1:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Elkanah	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
her,	1
Hannah,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
and	1
why	1
eatest	1
thou	1
not?	1
and	1
why	1
is	1
thy	1
heart	1
grieved?	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
better	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
ten	1
sons?	1
	1
1:9	1
So	1
Hannah	1
rose	1
up	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
drunk.	1
Now	1
Eli	1
the	1
priest	1
sat	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
a	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
bitterness	1
of	1
soul,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
wept	1
sore.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
she	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
indeed	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
remember	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
forget	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
but	1
wilt	1
give	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
razor	1
come	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
continued	1
praying	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
Eli	1
marked	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
Hannah,	1
she	1
spake	1
in	1
her	1
heart;	1
only	1
her	1
lips	1
moved,	1
but	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
not	1
heard:	1
therefore	1
Eli	1
thought	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
drunken.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Eli	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
drunken?	1
put	1
away	1
thy	1
wine	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
Hannah	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
spirit:	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
neither	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink,	1
but	1
have	1
poured	1
out	1
my	1
soul	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:16	1
Count	1
not	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
for	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Belial:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
my	1
complaint	1
and	1
grief	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
hitherto.	1
	1
1:17	1
Then	1
Eli	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
grant	1
thee	1
thy	1
petition	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
asked	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
So	1
the	1
woman	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
her	1
countenance	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sad.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
early,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
house	1
to	1
Ramah:	1
and	1
Elkanah	1
knew	1
Hannah	1
his	1
wife;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
remembered	1
her.	1
	1
1:20	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come	1
about	1
after	1
Hannah	1
had	1
conceived,	1
that	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
Because	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
Elkanah,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
yearly	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
his	1
vow.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
Hannah	1
went	1
not	1
up;	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
husband,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
until	1
the	1
child	1
be	1
weaned,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
there	1
abide	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
Elkanah	1
her	1
husband	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
thee	1
good;	1
tarry	1
until	1
thou	1
have	1
weaned	1
him;	1
only	1
the	1
LORD	1
establish	1
his	1
word.	1
So	1
the	1
woman	1
abode,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
son	1
suck	1
until	1
she	1
weaned	1
him.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
weaned	1
him,	1
she	1
took	1
him	1
up	1
with	1
her,	1
with	1
three	1
bullocks,	1
and	1
one	1
ephah	1
of	1
flour,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Shiloh:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
young.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
a	1
bullock,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
child	1
to	1
Eli.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Oh	1
my	1
lord,	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
woman	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
thee	1
here,	1
praying	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:27	1
For	1
this	1
child	1
I	1
prayed;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
my	1
petition	1
which	1
I	1
asked	1
of	1
him:	1
1:28	1
Therefore	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
lent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
LORD;	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
lent	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD	1
there.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Hannah	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
heart	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
mine	1
horn	1
is	1
exalted	1
in	1
the	1
LORD:	1
my	1
mouth	1
is	1
enlarged	1
over	1
mine	1
enemies;	1
because	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
salvation.	1
	1
2:2	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
holy	1
as	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
thee:	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
rock	1
like	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
2:3	1
Talk	1
no	1
more	1
so	1
exceeding	1
proudly;	1
let	1
not	1
arrogancy	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
actions	1
are	1
weighed.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
bows	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
are	1
broken,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
stumbled	1
are	1
girded	1
with	1
strength.	1
	1
2:5	1
They	1
that	1
were	1
full	1
have	1
hired	1
out	1
themselves	1
for	1
bread;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
hungry	1
ceased:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
barren	1
hath	1
born	1
seven;	1
and	1
she	1
that	1
hath	1
many	1
children	1
is	1
waxed	1
feeble.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
killeth,	1
and	1
maketh	1
alive:	1
he	1
bringeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
up.	1
	1
2:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
maketh	1
poor,	1
and	1
maketh	1
rich:	1
he	1
bringeth	1
low,	1
and	1
lifteth	1
up.	1
	1
2:8	1
He	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
poor	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
lifteth	1
up	1
the	1
beggar	1
from	1
the	1
dunghill,	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
among	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
inherit	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
glory:	1
for	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
the	1
world	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
darkness;	1
for	1
by	1
strength	1
shall	1
no	1
man	1
prevail.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces;	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
he	1
thunder	1
upon	1
them:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
strength	1
unto	1
his	1
king,	1
and	1
exalt	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
his	1
anointed.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
Elkanah	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
did	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
Eli	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli	1
were	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial;	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
priest's	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
was,	1
that,	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
offered	1
sacrifice,	1
the	1
priest's	1
servant	1
came,	1
while	1
the	1
flesh	1
was	1
in	1
seething,	1
with	1
a	1
fleshhook	1
of	1
three	1
teeth	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
2:14	1
And	1
he	1
struck	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pan,	1
or	1
kettle,	1
or	1
caldron,	1
or	1
pot;	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
fleshhook	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
for	1
himself.	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
came	1
thither.	1
	1
2:15	1
Also	1
before	1
they	1
burnt	1
the	1
fat,	1
the	1
priest's	1
servant	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
sacrificed,	1
Give	1
flesh	1
to	1
roast	1
for	1
the	1
priest;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
sodden	1
flesh	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
raw.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
them	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
fat	1
presently,	1
and	1
then	1
take	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth;	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
him,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
it	1
me	1
now:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
was	1
very	1
great	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
men	1
abhorred	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:18	1
But	1
Samuel	1
ministered	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
being	1
a	1
child,	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
2:19	1
Moreover	1
his	1
mother	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
coat,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
yearly	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
Eli	1
blessed	1
Elkanah	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
give	1
thee	1
seed	1
of	1
this	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
loan	1
which	1
is	1
lent	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
visited	1
Hannah,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
three	1
sons	1
and	1
two	1
daughters.	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
grew	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:22	1
Now	1
Eli	1
was	1
very	1
old,	1
and	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
sons	1
did	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
lay	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
assembled	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
such	1
things?	1
for	1
I	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
evil	1
dealings	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
2:24	1
Nay,	1
my	1
sons;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
report	1
that	1
I	1
hear:	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people	1
to	1
transgress.	1
	1
2:25	1
If	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
against	1
another,	1
the	1
judge	1
shall	1
judge	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
shall	1
intreat	1
for	1
him?	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
father,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
grew	1
on,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
favour	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
men.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Did	1
I	1
plainly	1
appear	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
Egypt	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
house?	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
did	1
I	1
choose	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
priest,	1
to	1
offer	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense,	1
to	1
wear	1
an	1
ephod	1
before	1
me?	1
and	1
did	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
all	1
the	1
offerings	1
made	1
by	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
2:29	1
Wherefore	1
kick	1
ye	1
at	1
my	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
at	1
mine	1
offering,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
in	1
my	1
habitation;	1
and	1
honourest	1
thy	1
sons	1
above	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
yourselves	1
fat	1
with	1
the	1
chiefest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
Israel	1
my	1
people?	1
	1
2:30	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
saith,	1
I	1
said	1
indeed	1
that	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
should	1
walk	1
before	1
me	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
honour	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
honour,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
despise	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
lightly	1
esteemed.	1
	1
2:31	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thine	1
arm,	1
and	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
an	1
enemy	1
in	1
my	1
habitation,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
which	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
thine,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
mine	1
altar,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
consume	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
grieve	1
thine	1
heart:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
their	1
age.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thy	1
two	1
sons,	1
on	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas;	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
they	1
shall	1
die	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:35	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
me	1
up	1
a	1
faithful	1
priest,	1
that	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
mind:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
him	1
a	1
sure	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
walk	1
before	1
mine	1
anointed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
thine	1
house	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
crouch	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
shall	1
say,	1
Put	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests'	1
offices,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
Samuel	1
ministered	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
Eli.	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
precious	1
in	1
those	1
days;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
open	1
vision.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
Eli	1
was	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
began	1
to	1
wax	1
dim,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see;	1
3:3	1
And	1
ere	1
the	1
lamp	1
of	1
God	1
went	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
where	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was,	1
and	1
Samuel	1
was	1
laid	1
down	1
to	1
sleep;	1
3:4	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Samuel:	1
and	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
calledst	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
called	1
not;	1
lie	1
down	1
again.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
yet	1
again,	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
didst	1
call	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
called	1
not,	1
my	1
son;	1
lie	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
3:7	1
Now	1
Samuel	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
know	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
yet	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
called	1
Samuel	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Eli,	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
am	1
I;	1
for	1
thou	1
didst	1
call	1
me.	1
And	1
Eli	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
child.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therefore	1
Eli	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Go,	1
lie	1
down:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
he	1
call	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say,	1
Speak,	1
LORD;	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
heareth.	1
So	1
Samuel	1
went	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
came,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
called	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
Samuel,	1
Samuel.	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
answered,	1
Speak;	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
heareth.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
Israel,	1
at	1
which	1
both	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
heareth	1
it	1
shall	1
tingle.	1
	1
3:12	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
I	1
will	1
perform	1
against	1
Eli	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
his	1
house:	1
when	1
I	1
begin,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
make	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
judge	1
his	1
house	1
for	1
ever	1
for	1
the	1
iniquity	1
which	1
he	1
knoweth;	1
because	1
his	1
sons	1
made	1
themselves	1
vile,	1
and	1
he	1
restrained	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eli,	1
that	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Eli's	1
house	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
purged	1
with	1
sacrifice	1
nor	1
offering	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
lay	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
feared	1
to	1
shew	1
Eli	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
Eli	1
called	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Samuel,	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
thee?	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
from	1
me:	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
thou	1
hide	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
me	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
Samuel	1
told	1
him	1
every	1
whit,	1
and	1
hid	1
nothing	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
LORD:	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
him	1
good.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
Samuel	1
grew,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba	1
knew	1
that	1
Samuel	1
was	1
established	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
again	1
in	1
Shiloh:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
revealed	1
himself	1
to	1
Samuel	1
in	1
Shiloh	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Samuel	1
came	1
to	1
all	1
Israel.	1
Now	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
pitched	1
beside	1
Ebenezer:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
pitched	1
in	1
Aphek.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
joined	1
battle,	1
Israel	1
was	1
smitten	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
about	1
four	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
smitten	1
us	1
to	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
Let	1
us	1
fetch	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
Shiloh	1
unto	1
us,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
cometh	1
among	1
us,	1
it	1
may	1
save	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
sent	1
to	1
Shiloh,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
were	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
camp,	1
all	1
Israel	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
shout,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
rang	1
again.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
shout,	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
shout	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews?	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
afraid,	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
camp.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
for	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
heretofore.	1
	1
4:8	1
Woe	1
unto	1
us!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
these	1
mighty	1
Gods?	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
Gods	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
plagues	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
quit	1
yourselves	1
like	1
men,	1
O	1
ye	1
Philistines,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
servants	1
unto	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
you:	1
quit	1
yourselves	1
like	1
men,	1
and	1
fight.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fought,	1
and	1
Israel	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
into	1
his	1
tent:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slaughter;	1
for	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
Israel	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
footmen.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Eli,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
were	1
slain.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
there	1
ran	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Shiloh	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
with	1
his	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
with	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
lo,	1
Eli	1
sat	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
the	1
wayside	1
watching:	1
for	1
his	1
heart	1
trembled	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
told	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
cried	1
out.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
when	1
Eli	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
crying,	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
this	1
tumult?	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
came	1
in	1
hastily,	1
and	1
told	1
Eli.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
Eli	1
was	1
ninety	1
and	1
eight	1
years	1
old;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
dim,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
Eli,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
I	1
fled	1
to	1
day	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
army.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
done,	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Israel	1
is	1
fled	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
there	1
hath	1
been	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
two	1
sons	1
also,	1
Hophni	1
and	1
Phinehas,	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
taken.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
seat	1
backward	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
his	1
neck	1
brake,	1
and	1
he	1
died:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
heavy.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
judged	1
Israel	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
Phinehas'	1
wife,	1
was	1
with	1
child,	1
near	1
to	1
be	1
delivered:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
tidings	1
that	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
were	1
dead,	1
she	1
bowed	1
herself	1
and	1
travailed;	1
for	1
her	1
pains	1
came	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
her	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
born	1
a	1
son.	1
But	1
she	1
answered	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
she	1
regard	1
it.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
child	1
Ichabod,	1
saying,	1
The	1
glory	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
Israel:	1
because	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
glory	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
taken.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
Ebenezer	1
unto	1
Ashdod.	1
	1
5:2	1
When	1
the	1
Philistines	1
took	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Dagon,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
by	1
Dagon.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
of	1
Ashdod	1
arose	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
behold,	1
Dagon	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Dagon,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
again.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
Dagon	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Dagon	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
threshold;	1
only	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
Dagon	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
Therefore	1
neither	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
Dagon,	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
come	1
into	1
Dagon's	1
house,	1
tread	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
Dagon	1
in	1
Ashdod	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
heavy	1
upon	1
them	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
he	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
emerods,	1
even	1
Ashdod	1
and	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Ashdod	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
abide	1
with	1
us:	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
sore	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
upon	1
Dagon	1
our	1
god.	1
	1
5:8	1
They	1
sent	1
therefore	1
and	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
Let	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
carried	1
about	1
unto	1
Gath.	1
And	1
they	1
carried	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
about	1
thither.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
about,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
destruction:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
emerods	1
in	1
their	1
secret	1
parts.	1
	1
5:10	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sent	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
Ekron.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Ekron,	1
that	1
the	1
Ekronites	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
about	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
slay	1
us	1
and	1
our	1
people.	1
	1
5:11	1
So	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
said,	1
Send	1
away	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place,	1
that	1
it	1
slay	1
us	1
not,	1
and	1
our	1
people:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deadly	1
destruction	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
city;	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
very	1
heavy	1
there.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
died	1
not	1
were	1
smitten	1
with	1
the	1
emerods:	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
seven	1
months.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
diviners,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
tell	1
us	1
wherewith	1
we	1
shall	1
send	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
If	1
ye	1
send	1
away	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
send	1
it	1
not	1
empty;	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
return	1
him	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering:	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
healed,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
why	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
removed	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
trespass	1
offering	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
him?	1
They	1
answered,	1
Five	1
golden	1
emerods,	1
and	1
five	1
golden	1
mice,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
one	1
plague	1
was	1
on	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
on	1
your	1
lords.	1
	1
6:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
make	1
images	1
of	1
your	1
emerods,	1
and	1
images	1
of	1
your	1
mice	1
that	1
mar	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
lighten	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
off	1
you,	1
and	1
from	1
off	1
your	1
gods,	1
and	1
from	1
off	1
your	1
land.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
do	1
ye	1
harden	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
and	1
Pharaoh	1
hardened	1
their	1
hearts?	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
wrought	1
wonderfully	1
among	1
them,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
people	1
go,	1
and	1
they	1
departed?	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
cart,	1
and	1
take	1
two	1
milch	1
kine,	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
hath	1
come	1
no	1
yoke,	1
and	1
tie	1
the	1
kine	1
to	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
bring	1
their	1
calves	1
home	1
from	1
them:	1
6:8	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
cart;	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
ye	1
return	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering,	1
in	1
a	1
coffer	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
thereof;	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
away,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
go.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
see,	1
if	1
it	1
goeth	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
coast	1
to	1
Bethshemesh,	1
then	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
us	1
this	1
great	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
smote	1
us:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
chance	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
did	1
so;	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
milch	1
kine,	1
and	1
tied	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
shut	1
up	1
their	1
calves	1
at	1
home:	1
6:11	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
upon	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
the	1
coffer	1
with	1
the	1
mice	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
emerods.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
kine	1
took	1
the	1
straight	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
highway,	1
lowing	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
turned	1
not	1
aside	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left;	1
and	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
after	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Bethshemesh.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
were	1
reaping	1
their	1
wheat	1
harvest	1
in	1
the	1
valley:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
cart	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
a	1
Bethshemite,	1
and	1
stood	1
there,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
stone:	1
and	1
they	1
clave	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
offered	1
the	1
kine	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
coffer	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
it,	1
wherein	1
the	1
jewels	1
of	1
gold	1
were,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
stone:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
sacrifices	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
five	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Ekron	1
the	1
same	1
day.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
golden	1
emerods	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
returned	1
for	1
a	1
trespass	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
Ashdod	1
one,	1
for	1
Gaza	1
one,	1
for	1
Askelon	1
one,	1
for	1
Gath	1
one,	1
for	1
Ekron	1
one;	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
golden	1
mice,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
five	1
lords,	1
both	1
of	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
of	1
country	1
villages,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
of	1
Abel,	1
whereon	1
they	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
which	1
stone	1
remaineth	1
unto	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Joshua,	1
the	1
Bethshemite.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
he	1
smote	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
men:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
lamented,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Bethshemesh	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
this	1
holy	1
LORD	1
God?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
shall	1
he	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
us?	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
have	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
come	1
ye	1
down,	1
and	1
fetch	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Kirjathjearim	1
came,	1
and	1
fetched	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
in	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
Eleazar	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
abode	1
in	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
long;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
twenty	1
years:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
lamented	1
after	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
Samuel	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
do	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
hearts,	1
then	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods	1
and	1
Ashtaroth	1
from	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
prepare	1
your	1
hearts	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
only:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
put	1
away	1
Baalim	1
and	1
Ashtaroth,	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
LORD	1
only.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Gather	1
all	1
Israel	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
for	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
drew	1
water,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
fasted	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
said	1
there,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
judged	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
Mizpeh.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
Mizpeh,	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
Israel.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
sucking	1
lamb,	1
and	1
offered	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
wholly	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
Samuel	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
Israel;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
him.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
as	1
Samuel	1
was	1
offering	1
up	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
Israel:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
thundered	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
thunder	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
pursued	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
smote	1
them,	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
under	1
Bethcar.	1
	1
7:12	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
between	1
Mizpeh	1
and	1
Shen,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Ebenezer,	1
saying,	1
Hitherto	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
helped	1
us.	1
	1
7:13	1
So	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
subdued,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Samuel.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
Israel	1
were	1
restored	1
to	1
Israel,	1
from	1
Ekron	1
even	1
unto	1
Gath;	1
and	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof	1
did	1
Israel	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
between	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
judged	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
in	1
circuit	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
Mizpeh,	1
and	1
judged	1
Israel	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
places.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
his	1
return	1
was	1
to	1
Ramah;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
judged	1
Israel;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Samuel	1
was	1
old,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
sons	1
judges	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:2	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
firstborn	1
was	1
Joel;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
second,	1
Abiah:	1
they	1
were	1
judges	1
in	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
his	1
sons	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
but	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
lucre,	1
and	1
took	1
bribes,	1
and	1
perverted	1
judgment.	1
	1
8:4	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel	1
unto	1
Ramah,	1
8:5	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
old,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
walk	1
not	1
in	1
thy	1
ways:	1
now	1
make	1
us	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
judge	1
us	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
the	1
thing	1
displeased	1
Samuel,	1
when	1
they	1
said,	1
Give	1
us	1
a	1
king	1
to	1
judge	1
us.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
rejected	1
thee,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
rejected	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
reign	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
8:8	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
served	1
other	1
gods,	1
so	1
do	1
they	1
also	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
8:9	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
voice:	1
howbeit	1
yet	1
protest	1
solemnly	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
shew	1
them	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Samuel	1
told	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
you:	1
He	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
appoint	1
them	1
for	1
himself,	1
for	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
horsemen;	1
and	1
some	1
shall	1
run	1
before	1
his	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
appoint	1
him	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
fifties;	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
ear	1
his	1
ground,	1
and	1
to	1
reap	1
his	1
harvest,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
instruments	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
instruments	1
of	1
his	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
daughters	1
to	1
be	1
confectionaries,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
cooks,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
bakers.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
fields,	1
and	1
your	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
your	1
oliveyards,	1
even	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
his	1
officers,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
your	1
menservants,	1
and	1
your	1
maidservants,	1
and	1
your	1
goodliest	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
your	1
asses,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
8:17	1
He	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
your	1
sheep:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
king	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
chosen	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
8:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
refused	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Samuel;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
us;	1
8:20	1
That	1
we	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
king	1
may	1
judge	1
us,	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
fight	1
our	1
battles.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
Samuel	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
rehearsed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Samuel,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
king.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Go	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
city.	1
	1
9:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Kish,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiel,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeror,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bechorath,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aphiah,	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
power.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul,	1
a	1
choice	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
goodly:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
goodlier	1
person	1
than	1
he:	1
from	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
upward	1
he	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
asses	1
of	1
Kish	1
Saul's	1
father	1
were	1
lost.	1
And	1
Kish	1
said	1
to	1
Saul	1
his	1
son,	1
Take	1
now	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
arise,	1
go	1
seek	1
the	1
asses.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shalisha,	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not:	1
then	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shalim,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
not:	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Benjamites,	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Zuph,	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return;	1
lest	1
my	1
father	1
leave	1
caring	1
for	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
take	1
thought	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honourable	1
man;	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
cometh	1
surely	1
to	1
pass:	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
thither;	1
peradventure	1
he	1
can	1
shew	1
us	1
our	1
way	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go.	1
	1
9:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
But,	1
behold,	1
if	1
we	1
go,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
bring	1
the	1
man?	1
for	1
the	1
bread	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
our	1
vessels,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God:	1
what	1
have	1
we?	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
answered	1
Saul	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
at	1
hand	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
shekel	1
of	1
silver:	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
our	1
way.	1
	1
9:9	1
(Beforetime	1
in	1
Israel,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
went	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God,	1
thus	1
he	1
spake,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
seer:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
now	1
called	1
a	1
Prophet	1
was	1
beforetime	1
called	1
a	1
Seer.)	1
	1
9:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Well	1
said;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
go.	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
was.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
they	1
found	1
young	1
maidens	1
going	1
out	1
to	1
draw	1
water,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
the	1
seer	1
here?	1
9:12	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
is;	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
you:	1
make	1
haste	1
now,	1
for	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
city;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
place:	1
9:13	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
ye	1
shall	1
straightway	1
find	1
him,	1
before	1
he	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
to	1
eat:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
not	1
eat	1
until	1
he	1
come,	1
because	1
he	1
doth	1
bless	1
the	1
sacrifice;	1
and	1
afterwards	1
they	1
eat	1
that	1
be	1
bidden.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
get	1
you	1
up;	1
for	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
Samuel	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
them,	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place.	1
	1
9:15	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
told	1
Samuel	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
a	1
day	1
before	1
Saul	1
came,	1
saying,	1
9:16	1
To	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
my	1
people,	1
because	1
their	1
cry	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
saw	1
Saul,	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
thee	1
of!	1
this	1
same	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
9:18	1
Then	1
Saul	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
Samuel	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
where	1
the	1
seer's	1
house	1
is.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
Samuel	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
seer:	1
go	1
up	1
before	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
place;	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
thine	1
asses	1
that	1
were	1
lost	1
three	1
days	1
ago,	1
set	1
not	1
thy	1
mind	1
on	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
found.	1
And	1
on	1
whom	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
Israel?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
thy	1
father's	1
house?	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Am	1
not	1
I	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
of	1
the	1
smallest	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel?	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
speakest	1
thou	1
so	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
Samuel	1
took	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
parlour,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
chiefest	1
place	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden,	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
thirty	1
persons.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
cook,	1
Bring	1
the	1
portion	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
thee,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Set	1
it	1
by	1
thee.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
the	1
cook	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
Saul.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Behold	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
left!	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
eat:	1
for	1
unto	1
this	1
time	1
hath	1
it	1
been	1
kept	1
for	1
thee	1
since	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
invited	1
the	1
people.	1
So	1
Saul	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
Samuel	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
Samuel	1
communed	1
with	1
Saul	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
they	1
arose	1
early:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
that	1
Samuel	1
called	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Up,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
thee	1
away.	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
abroad.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Bid	1
the	1
servant	1
pass	1
on	1
before	1
us,	1
(and	1
he	1
passed	1
on),	1
but	1
stand	1
thou	1
still	1
a	1
while,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:1	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
a	1
vial	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
his	1
inheritance?	1
	1
10:2	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
departed	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
day,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
two	1
men	1
by	1
Rachel's	1
sepulchre	1
in	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
at	1
Zelzah;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
asses	1
which	1
thou	1
wentest	1
to	1
seek	1
are	1
found:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
thy	1
father	1
hath	1
left	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
sorroweth	1
for	1
you,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
10:3	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
on	1
forward	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Tabor,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
meet	1
thee	1
three	1
men	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
one	1
carrying	1
three	1
kids,	1
and	1
another	1
carrying	1
three	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
another	1
carrying	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine:	1
10:4	1
And	1
they	1
will	1
salute	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
two	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread;	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
10:5	1
After	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
God,	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
meet	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
prophets	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
with	1
a	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
a	1
tabret,	1
and	1
a	1
pipe,	1
and	1
a	1
harp,	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
10:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
prophesy	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
be,	1
when	1
these	1
signs	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
do	1
as	1
occasion	1
serve	1
thee;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
down	1
before	1
me	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings:	1
seven	1
days	1
shalt	1
thou	1
tarry,	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
to	1
go	1
from	1
Samuel,	1
God	1
gave	1
him	1
another	1
heart:	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
signs	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1
hill,	1
behold,	1
a	1
company	1
of	1
prophets	1
met	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
prophesied	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
that	1
knew	1
him	1
beforetime	1
saw	1
that,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
among	1
the	1
prophets,	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kish?	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
their	1
father?	1
Therefore	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
proverb,	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
prophesying,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
Saul's	1
uncle	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Whither	1
went	1
ye?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
seek	1
the	1
asses:	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
where,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
Saul's	1
uncle	1
said,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
what	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
uncle,	1
He	1
told	1
us	1
plainly	1
that	1
the	1
asses	1
were	1
found.	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
whereof	1
Samuel	1
spake,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
Samuel	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Mizpeh;	1
10:18	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
oppressed	1
you:	1
10:19	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
this	1
day	1
rejected	1
your	1
God,	1
who	1
himself	1
saved	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
adversities	1
and	1
your	1
tribulations;	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
but	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
us.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
present	1
yourselves	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
your	1
tribes,	1
and	1
by	1
your	1
thousands.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
had	1
caused	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
come	1
near,	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
10:21	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
come	1
near	1
by	1
their	1
families,	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Matri	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kish	1
was	1
taken:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
sought	1
him,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
10:22	1
Therefore	1
they	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
further,	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
should	1
yet	1
come	1
thither.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered,	1
Behold	1
he	1
hath	1
hid	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
stuff.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
they	1
ran	1
and	1
fetched	1
him	1
thence:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
upward.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
See	1
ye	1
him	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
him	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people?	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shouted,	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
10:25	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
told	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
wrote	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
sent	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
away,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
Saul	1
also	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
Gibeah;	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men,	1
whose	1
hearts	1
God	1
had	1
touched.	1
	1
10:27	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
save	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
despised	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
no	1
presents.	1
But	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
11:1	1
Then	1
Nahash	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
Jabeshgilead:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said	1
unto	1
Nahash,	1
Make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
Nahash	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
answered	1
them,	1
On	1
this	1
condition	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
thrust	1
out	1
all	1
your	1
right	1
eyes,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
reproach	1
upon	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
us	1
seven	1
days'	1
respite,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
send	1
messengers	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
save	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
11:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
messengers	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
tidings	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
11:5	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
came	1
after	1
the	1
herd	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
Saul	1
said,	1
What	1
aileth	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
they	1
weep?	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Saul	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
those	1
tidings,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
greatly.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
hewed	1
them	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
messengers,	1
saying,	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
not	1
forth	1
after	1
Saul	1
and	1
after	1
Samuel,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
his	1
oxen.	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
one	1
consent.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
numbered	1
them	1
in	1
Bezek,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
thirty	1
thousand.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
messengers	1
that	1
came,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead,	1
To	1
morrow,	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
hot,	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
help.	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
came	1
and	1
shewed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
glad.	1
	1
11:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
said,	1
To	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
that	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
Saul	1
put	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
three	1
companies;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
watch,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
until	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
remained	1
were	1
scattered,	1
so	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
left	1
together.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Saul	1
reign	1
over	1
us?	1
bring	1
the	1
men,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
this	1
day:	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
wrought	1
salvation	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
renew	1
the	1
kingdom	1
there.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
made	1
Saul	1
king	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
there	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
rejoiced	1
greatly.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
your	1
voice	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
ye	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king	1
walketh	1
before	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
and	1
grayheaded;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
my	1
sons	1
are	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
before	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
childhood	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
12:3	1
Behold,	1
here	1
I	1
am:	1
witness	1
against	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
anointed:	1
whose	1
ox	1
have	1
I	1
taken?	1
or	1
whose	1
ass	1
have	1
I	1
taken?	1
or	1
whom	1
have	1
I	1
defrauded?	1
whom	1
have	1
I	1
oppressed?	1
or	1
of	1
whose	1
hand	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
any	1
bribe	1
to	1
blind	1
mine	1
eyes	1
therewith?	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
not	1
defrauded	1
us,	1
nor	1
oppressed	1
us,	1
neither	1
hast	1
thou	1
taken	1
ought	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
hand.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
his	1
anointed	1
is	1
witness	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
ought	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
He	1
is	1
witness.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
advanced	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
that	1
brought	1
your	1
fathers	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
stand	1
still,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
reason	1
with	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
righteous	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
12:8	1
When	1
Jacob	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Moses	1
and	1
Aaron,	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
your	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
dwell	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
forgat	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
he	1
sold	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Sisera,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hazor,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
they	1
fought	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
served	1
Baalim	1
and	1
Ashtaroth:	1
but	1
now	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Jerubbaal,	1
and	1
Bedan,	1
and	1
Jephthah,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
your	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
and	1
ye	1
dwelled	1
safe.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
saw	1
that	1
Nahash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
came	1
against	1
you,	1
ye	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
a	1
king	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
us:	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
was	1
your	1
king.	1
	1
12:13	1
Now	1
therefore	1
behold	1
the	1
king	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
chosen,	1
and	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
desired!	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
set	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
you.	1
	1
12:14	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
obey	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
not	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
shall	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
reigneth	1
over	1
you	1
continue	1
following	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
12:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
against	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
against	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
12:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
stand	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
great	1
thing,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
before	1
your	1
eyes.	1
	1
12:17	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
wheat	1
harvest	1
to	1
day?	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
thunder	1
and	1
rain;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
perceive	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
wickedness	1
is	1
great,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
asking	1
you	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
12:18	1
So	1
Samuel	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thunder	1
and	1
rain	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
greatly	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
Samuel.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Pray	1
for	1
thy	1
servants	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
die	1
not:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
added	1
unto	1
all	1
our	1
sins	1
this	1
evil,	1
to	1
ask	1
us	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
wickedness:	1
yet	1
turn	1
not	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart;	1
12:21	1
And	1
turn	1
ye	1
not	1
aside:	1
for	1
then	1
should	1
ye	1
go	1
after	1
vain	1
things,	1
which	1
cannot	1
profit	1
nor	1
deliver;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
12:22	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
his	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
name's	1
sake:	1
because	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
12:23	1
Moreover	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
ceasing	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
right	1
way:	1
12:24	1
Only	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
truth	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart:	1
for	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
12:25	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
still	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed,	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
king.	1
	1
13:1	1
Saul	1
reigned	1
one	1
year;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
reigned	1
two	1
years	1
over	1
Israel,	1
13:2	1
Saul	1
chose	1
him	1
three	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Israel;	1
whereof	1
two	1
thousand	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
in	1
Michmash	1
and	1
in	1
mount	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
were	1
with	1
Jonathan	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
sent	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
smote	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Geba,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
Saul	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
hear.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
smitten	1
a	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
that	1
Israel	1
also	1
was	1
had	1
in	1
abomination	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
called	1
together	1
after	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Israel,	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
in	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Michmash,	1
eastward	1
from	1
Bethaven.	1
	1
13:6	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
strait,	1
(for	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
distressed,)	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
caves,	1
and	1
in	1
thickets,	1
and	1
in	1
rocks,	1
and	1
in	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
in	1
pits.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gad	1
and	1
Gilead.	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
him	1
trembling.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
he	1
tarried	1
seven	1
days,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
that	1
Samuel	1
had	1
appointed:	1
but	1
Samuel	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
Gilgal;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
And	1
he	1
offered	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
behold,	1
Samuel	1
came;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
salute	1
him.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Because	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
scattered	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
days	1
appointed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
Michmash;	1
13:12	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
The	1
Philistines	1
will	1
come	1
down	1
now	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
supplication	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
forced	1
myself	1
therefore,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
done	1
foolishly:	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
for	1
now	1
would	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
established	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
now	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
not	1
continue:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sought	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
over	1
his	1
people,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
thee.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
arose,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
Gilgal	1
unto	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
And	1
Saul	1
numbered	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
with	1
him,	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
Saul,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
with	1
them,	1
abode	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
but	1
the	1
Philistines	1
encamped	1
in	1
Michmash.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
the	1
spoilers	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
in	1
three	1
companies:	1
one	1
company	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
leadeth	1
to	1
Ophrah,	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shual:	1
13:18	1
And	1
another	1
company	1
turned	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Bethhoron:	1
and	1
another	1
company	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
border	1
that	1
looketh	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Zeboim	1
toward	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
smith	1
found	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Lest	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
make	1
them	1
swords	1
or	1
spears:	1
13:20	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
to	1
sharpen	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
share,	1
and	1
his	1
coulter,	1
and	1
his	1
axe,	1
and	1
his	1
mattock.	1
	1
13:21	1
Yet	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
file	1
for	1
the	1
mattocks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
coulters,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
forks,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
axes,	1
and	1
to	1
sharpen	1
the	1
goads.	1
	1
13:22	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
sword	1
nor	1
spear	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan:	1
but	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
with	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
there	1
found.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
Michmash.	1
	1
14:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
upon	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
his	1
armour,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
garrison,	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
But	1
he	1
told	1
not	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
tarried	1
in	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
Gibeah	1
under	1
a	1
pomegranate	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Migron:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
about	1
six	1
hundred	1
men;	1
14:3	1
And	1
Ahiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
Ichabod's	1
brother,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eli,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
priest	1
in	1
Shiloh,	1
wearing	1
an	1
ephod.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
gone.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
between	1
the	1
passages,	1
by	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
garrison,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sharp	1
rock	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
a	1
sharp	1
rock	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Bozez,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Seneh.	1
	1
14:5	1
The	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
situate	1
northward	1
over	1
against	1
Michmash,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
southward	1
over	1
against	1
Gibeah.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
his	1
armour,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
these	1
uncircumcised:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
work	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
restraint	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
save	1
by	1
many	1
or	1
by	1
few.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
turn	1
thee;	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
heart.	1
	1
14:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
unto	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
discover	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:9	1
If	1
they	1
say	1
thus	1
unto	1
us,	1
Tarry	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
stand	1
still	1
in	1
our	1
place,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
say	1
thus,	1
Come	1
up	1
unto	1
us;	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
up:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
our	1
hand:	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
discovered	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holes	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
hid	1
themselves.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
garrison	1
answered	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
thing.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
Come	1
up	1
after	1
me:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
climbed	1
up	1
upon	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
after	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
before	1
Jonathan;	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
slew	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
that	1
first	1
slaughter,	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
made,	1
was	1
about	1
twenty	1
men,	1
within	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
half	1
acre	1
of	1
land,	1
which	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen	1
might	1
plow.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
trembling	1
in	1
the	1
host,	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
the	1
garrison,	1
and	1
the	1
spoilers,	1
they	1
also	1
trembled,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
quaked:	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
trembling.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
the	1
watchmen	1
of	1
Saul	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
looked;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
multitude	1
melted	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
beating	1
down	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
14:17	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Number	1
now,	1
and	1
see	1
who	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
us.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
numbered,	1
behold,	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
were	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahiah,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
Saul	1
talked	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
that	1
the	1
noise	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
increased:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
priest,	1
Withdraw	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
assembled	1
themselves,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
battle:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
every	1
man's	1
sword	1
was	1
against	1
his	1
fellow,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
discomfiture.	1
	1
14:21	1
Moreover	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines	1
before	1
that	1
time,	1
which	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
even	1
they	1
also	1
turned	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan.	1
	1
14:22	1
Likewise	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
had	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fled,	1
even	1
they	1
also	1
followed	1
hard	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
14:23	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
Israel	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
passed	1
over	1
unto	1
Bethaven.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
distressed	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
Saul	1
had	1
adjured	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
food	1
until	1
evening,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
avenged	1
on	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
So	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
tasted	1
any	1
food.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
wood;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
honey	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
behold,	1
the	1
honey	1
dropped;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
feared	1
the	1
oath.	1
	1
14:27	1
But	1
Jonathan	1
heard	1
not	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
charged	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
oath:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
dipped	1
it	1
in	1
an	1
honeycomb,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
enlightened.	1
	1
14:28	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
father	1
straitly	1
charged	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
saying,	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
eateth	1
any	1
food	1
this	1
day.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
faint.	1
	1
14:29	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan,	1
My	1
father	1
hath	1
troubled	1
the	1
land:	1
see,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
how	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
been	1
enlightened,	1
because	1
I	1
tasted	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
this	1
honey.	1
	1
14:30	1
How	1
much	1
more,	1
if	1
haply	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
eaten	1
freely	1
to	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
their	1
enemies	1
which	1
they	1
found?	1
for	1
had	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
now	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines	1
that	1
day	1
from	1
Michmash	1
to	1
Aijalon:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
very	1
faint.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
flew	1
upon	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
took	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
calves,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
eat	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
	1
14:33	1
Then	1
they	1
told	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
people	1
sin	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
have	1
transgressed:	1
roll	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
14:34	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Disperse	1
yourselves	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
me	1
hither	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ox,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sheep,	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
here,	1
and	1
eat;	1
and	1
sin	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
eating	1
with	1
the	1
blood.	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
brought	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
ox	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
Saul	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
altar	1
that	1
he	1
built	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
down	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
spoil	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Do	1
whatsoever	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
priest,	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
hither	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
14:37	1
And	1
Saul	1
asked	1
counsel	1
of	1
God,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
down	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Israel?	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
14:38	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Draw	1
ye	1
near	1
hither,	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
know	1
and	1
see	1
wherein	1
this	1
sin	1
hath	1
been	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
14:39	1
For,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
saveth	1
Israel,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son,	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
answered	1
him.	1
	1
14:40	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
Be	1
ye	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son	1
will	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Do	1
what	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
14:41	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Give	1
a	1
perfect	1
lot.	1
	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
were	1
taken:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
escaped.	1
	1
14:42	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Cast	1
lots	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
14:43	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
Jonathan,	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done.	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
did	1
but	1
taste	1
a	1
little	1
honey	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rod	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
I	1
must	1
die.	1
	1
14:44	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered,	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
more	1
also:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
Jonathan.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Shall	1
Jonathan	1
die,	1
who	1
hath	1
wrought	1
this	1
great	1
salvation	1
in	1
Israel?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
wrought	1
with	1
God	1
this	1
day.	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
rescued	1
Jonathan,	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
not.	1
	1
14:46	1
Then	1
Saul	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
14:47	1
So	1
Saul	1
took	1
the	1
kingdom	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
all	1
his	1
enemies	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
against	1
Moab,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
against	1
Edom,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
turned	1
himself,	1
he	1
vexed	1
them.	1
	1
14:48	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
an	1
host,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
delivered	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
spoiled	1
them.	1
	1
14:49	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Saul	1
were	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Ishui,	1
and	1
Melchishua:	1
and	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
daughters	1
were	1
these;	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn	1
Merab,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
Michal:	1
14:50	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Saul's	1
wife	1
was	1
Ahinoam,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ahimaaz:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
was	1
Abner,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
Saul's	1
uncle.	1
	1
14:51	1
And	1
Kish	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Saul;	1
and	1
Ner	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Abner	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiel.	1
	1
14:52	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
sore	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul:	1
and	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
any	1
strong	1
man,	1
or	1
any	1
valiant	1
man,	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:1	1
Samuel	1
also	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
The	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
anoint	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
his	1
people,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
now	1
therefore	1
hearken	1
thou	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
which	1
Amalek	1
did	1
to	1
Israel,	1
how	1
he	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
Egypt.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
go	1
and	1
smite	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have,	1
and	1
spare	1
them	1
not;	1
but	1
slay	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
infant	1
and	1
suckling,	1
ox	1
and	1
sheep,	1
camel	1
and	1
ass.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Saul	1
gathered	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
numbered	1
them	1
in	1
Telaim,	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
Saul	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
laid	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
Go,	1
depart,	1
get	1
you	1
down	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
lest	1
I	1
destroy	1
you	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
ye	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
So	1
the	1
Kenites	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
Saul	1
smote	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
from	1
Havilah	1
until	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
Shur,	1
that	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Egypt.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
alive,	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
spared	1
Agag,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fatlings,	1
and	1
the	1
lambs,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
them:	1
but	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
vile	1
and	1
refuse,	1
that	1
they	1
destroyed	1
utterly.	1
	1
15:10	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
15:11	1
It	1
repenteth	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
Saul	1
to	1
be	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
following	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
performed	1
my	1
commandments.	1
And	1
it	1
grieved	1
Samuel;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
when	1
Samuel	1
rose	1
early	1
to	1
meet	1
Saul	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Samuel,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
came	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
set	1
him	1
up	1
a	1
place,	1
and	1
is	1
gone	1
about,	1
and	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
Samuel	1
came	1
to	1
Saul:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
then	1
this	1
bleating	1
of	1
the	1
sheep	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
and	1
the	1
lowing	1
of	1
the	1
oxen	1
which	1
I	1
hear?	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Amalekites:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
spared	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oxen,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
we	1
have	1
utterly	1
destroyed.	1
	1
15:16	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Stay,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
this	1
night.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
little	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
sight,	1
wast	1
thou	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel?	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
thee	1
on	1
a	1
journey,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
sinners	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
until	1
they	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
didst	1
fly	1
upon	1
the	1
spoil,	1
and	1
didst	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
15:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
have	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
gone	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
have	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
of	1
the	1
spoil,	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
utterly	1
destroyed,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
Hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
as	1
great	1
delight	1
in	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
as	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
Behold,	1
to	1
obey	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
to	1
hearken	1
than	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
rams.	1
	1
15:23	1
For	1
rebellion	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
witchcraft,	1
and	1
stubbornness	1
is	1
as	1
iniquity	1
and	1
idolatry.	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
hath	1
also	1
rejected	1
thee	1
from	1
being	1
king.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thy	1
words:	1
because	1
I	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
obeyed	1
their	1
voice.	1
	1
15:25	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
pardon	1
my	1
sin,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rejected	1
thee	1
from	1
being	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
as	1
Samuel	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
it	1
rent.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rent	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
thine,	1
that	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
thou.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Strength	1
of	1
Israel	1
will	1
not	1
lie	1
nor	1
repent:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
repent.	1
	1
15:30	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
yet	1
honour	1
me	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
before	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
before	1
Israel,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
15:31	1
So	1
Samuel	1
turned	1
again	1
after	1
Saul;	1
and	1
Saul	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel,	1
Bring	1
ye	1
hither	1
to	1
me	1
Agag	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites.	1
And	1
Agag	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
delicately.	1
And	1
Agag	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
past.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
sword	1
hath	1
made	1
women	1
childless,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
mother	1
be	1
childless	1
among	1
women.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
hewed	1
Agag	1
in	1
pieces	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
15:34	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
Samuel	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
Saul	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
nevertheless	1
Samuel	1
mourned	1
for	1
Saul:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
Saul	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
How	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
mourn	1
for	1
Saul,	1
seeing	1
I	1
have	1
rejected	1
him	1
from	1
reigning	1
over	1
Israel?	1
fill	1
thine	1
horn	1
with	1
oil,	1
and	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
provided	1
me	1
a	1
king	1
among	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
go?	1
if	1
Saul	1
hear	1
it,	1
he	1
will	1
kill	1
me.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Take	1
an	1
heifer	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
call	1
Jesse	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
anoint	1
unto	1
me	1
him	1
whom	1
I	1
name	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
Samuel	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
trembled	1
at	1
his	1
coming,	1
and	1
said,	1
Comest	1
thou	1
peaceably?	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Peaceably:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
And	1
he	1
sanctified	1
Jesse	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Surely	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed	1
is	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Samuel,	1
Look	1
not	1
on	1
his	1
countenance,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
his	1
stature;	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
refused	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
seeth	1
not	1
as	1
man	1
seeth;	1
for	1
man	1
looketh	1
on	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance,	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
looketh	1
on	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
16:8	1
Then	1
Jesse	1
called	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
pass	1
before	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
chosen	1
this.	1
	1
16:9	1
Then	1
Jesse	1
made	1
Shammah	1
to	1
pass	1
by.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
chosen	1
this.	1
	1
16:10	1
Again,	1
Jesse	1
made	1
seven	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
to	1
pass	1
before	1
Samuel.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
chosen	1
these.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
Are	1
here	1
all	1
thy	1
children?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
There	1
remaineth	1
yet	1
the	1
youngest,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
Send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him:	1
for	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
till	1
he	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
he	1
sent,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
in.	1
Now	1
he	1
was	1
ruddy,	1
and	1
withal	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
countenance,	1
and	1
goodly	1
to	1
look	1
to.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
anoint	1
him:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
16:13	1
Then	1
Samuel	1
took	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
David	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forward.	1
So	1
Samuel	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Ramah.	1
	1
16:14	1
But	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
departed	1
from	1
Saul,	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
troubled	1
him.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Saul's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
an	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
troubleth	1
thee.	1
	1
16:16	1
Let	1
our	1
lord	1
now	1
command	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
are	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
a	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
cunning	1
player	1
on	1
an	1
harp:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
play	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
well.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Provide	1
me	1
now	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
can	1
play	1
well,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
16:18	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite,	1
that	1
is	1
cunning	1
in	1
playing,	1
and	1
a	1
mighty	1
valiant	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
prudent	1
in	1
matters,	1
and	1
a	1
comely	1
person,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
16:19	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
said,	1
Send	1
me	1
David	1
thy	1
son,	1
which	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
Jesse	1
took	1
an	1
ass	1
laden	1
with	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
by	1
David	1
his	1
son	1
unto	1
Saul.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Saul,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
greatly;	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
his	1
armourbearer.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
to	1
Jesse,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
David,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
stand	1
before	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
that	1
David	1
took	1
an	1
harp,	1
and	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand:	1
so	1
Saul	1
was	1
refreshed,	1
and	1
was	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
together	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Shochoh,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
pitched	1
between	1
Shochoh	1
and	1
Azekah,	1
in	1
Ephesdammim.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
pitched	1
by	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
Israel	1
stood	1
on	1
a	1
mountain	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
between	1
them.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
champion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
named	1
Goliath,	1
of	1
Gath,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
six	1
cubits	1
and	1
a	1
span.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail;	1
and	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
five	1
thousand	1
shekels	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
greaves	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
a	1
target	1
of	1
brass	1
between	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
his	1
spear	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam;	1
and	1
his	1
spear's	1
head	1
weighed	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
one	1
bearing	1
a	1
shield	1
went	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
set	1
your	1
battle	1
in	1
array?	1
am	1
not	1
I	1
a	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
ye	1
servants	1
to	1
Saul?	1
choose	1
you	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
then	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
your	1
servants:	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
prevail	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
kill	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
our	1
servants,	1
and	1
serve	1
us.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said,	1
I	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel	1
this	1
day;	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
fight	1
together.	1
	1
17:11	1
When	1
Saul	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
those	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed,	1
and	1
greatly	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:12	1
Now	1
David	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
that	1
Ephrathite	1
of	1
Bethlehemjudah,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Jesse;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
eight	1
sons:	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
went	1
among	1
men	1
for	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
eldest	1
sons	1
of	1
Jesse	1
went	1
and	1
followed	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
battle:	1
and	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
were	1
Eliab	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
next	1
unto	1
him	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
Shammah.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
the	1
youngest:	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
eldest	1
followed	1
Saul.	1
	1
17:15	1
But	1
David	1
went	1
and	1
returned	1
from	1
Saul	1
to	1
feed	1
his	1
father's	1
sheep	1
at	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
drew	1
near	1
morning	1
and	1
evening,	1
and	1
presented	1
himself	1
forty	1
days.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Jesse	1
said	1
unto	1
David	1
his	1
son,	1
Take	1
now	1
for	1
thy	1
brethren	1
an	1
ephah	1
of	1
this	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
these	1
ten	1
loaves,	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren;	1
17:18	1
And	1
carry	1
these	1
ten	1
cheeses	1
unto	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
thousand,	1
and	1
look	1
how	1
thy	1
brethren	1
fare,	1
and	1
take	1
their	1
pledge.	1
	1
17:19	1
Now	1
Saul,	1
and	1
they,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
fighting	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
David	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
sheep	1
with	1
a	1
keeper,	1
and	1
took,	1
and	1
went,	1
as	1
Jesse	1
had	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
trench,	1
as	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
going	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
shouted	1
for	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
17:21	1
For	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array,	1
army	1
against	1
army.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
David	1
left	1
his	1
carriage	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
saluted	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
champion,	1
the	1
Philistine	1
of	1
Gath,	1
Goliath	1
by	1
name,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
spake	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
words:	1
and	1
David	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
man,	1
fled	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Have	1
ye	1
seen	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
up?	1
	1
surely	1
to	1
defy	1
Israel	1
is	1
he	1
come	1
up:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
killeth	1
him,	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
enrich	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
riches,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
free	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
David	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
killeth	1
this	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
reproach	1
from	1
Israel?	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistine,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
defy	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
him	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
saying,	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
killeth	1
him.	1
	1
17:28	1
And	1
Eliab	1
his	1
eldest	1
brother	1
heard	1
when	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
men;	1
and	1
Eliab's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
David,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Why	1
camest	1
thou	1
down	1
hither?	1
and	1
with	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
left	1
those	1
few	1
sheep	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
pride,	1
and	1
the	1
naughtiness	1
of	1
thine	1
heart;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
down	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
see	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
17:29	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
now	1
done?	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
cause?	1
17:30	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
from	1
him	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
spake	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
manner:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
him	1
again	1
after	1
the	1
former	1
manner.	1
	1
17:31	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
heard	1
which	1
David	1
spake,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
them	1
before	1
Saul:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Let	1
no	1
man's	1
heart	1
fail	1
because	1
of	1
him;	1
thy	1
servant	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
this	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:33	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
this	1
Philistine	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
but	1
a	1
youth,	1
and	1
he	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war	1
from	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
17:34	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
kept	1
his	1
father's	1
sheep,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
lamb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock:	1
17:35	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
delivered	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
arose	1
against	1
me,	1
I	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
beard,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
17:36	1
Thy	1
servant	1
slew	1
both	1
the	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
bear:	1
and	1
this	1
uncircumcised	1
Philistine	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
seeing	1
he	1
hath	1
defied	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
17:37	1
David	1
said	1
moreover,	1
The	1
LORD	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
lion,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
the	1
bear,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
this	1
Philistine.	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
17:38	1
And	1
Saul	1
armed	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
an	1
helmet	1
of	1
brass	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
also	1
he	1
armed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail.	1
	1
17:39	1
And	1
David	1
girded	1
his	1
sword	1
upon	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
go;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
proved	1
it.	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
cannot	1
go	1
with	1
these;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
proved	1
them.	1
And	1
David	1
put	1
them	1
off	1
him.	1
	1
17:40	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
chose	1
him	1
five	1
smooth	1
stones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
shepherd's	1
bag	1
which	1
he	1
had,	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
scrip;	1
and	1
his	1
sling	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:41	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
came	1
on	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
shield	1
went	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
17:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
looked	1
about,	1
and	1
saw	1
David,	1
he	1
disdained	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
youth,	1
and	1
ruddy,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
countenance.	1
	1
17:43	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
dog,	1
that	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
staves?	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
cursed	1
David	1
by	1
his	1
gods.	1
	1
17:44	1
And	1
the	1
Philistine	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thy	1
flesh	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
17:45	1
Then	1
said	1
David	1
to	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
Thou	1
comest	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
spear,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
shield:	1
but	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
defied.	1
	1
17:46	1
This	1
day	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
deliver	1
thee	1
into	1
mine	1
hand;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
thine	1
head	1
from	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
carcases	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:47	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
assembly	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
saveth	1
not	1
with	1
sword	1
and	1
spear:	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
into	1
our	1
hands.	1
	1
17:48	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistine	1
arose,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
that	1
David	1
hastened,	1
and	1
ran	1
toward	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
17:49	1
And	1
David	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
bag,	1
and	1
took	1
thence	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
slang	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
sunk	1
into	1
his	1
forehead;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
17:50	1
So	1
David	1
prevailed	1
over	1
the	1
Philistine	1
with	1
a	1
sling	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stone,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
slew	1
him;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
17:51	1
Therefore	1
David	1
ran,	1
and	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sheath	1
thereof,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
therewith.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
saw	1
their	1
champion	1
was	1
dead,	1
they	1
fled.	1
	1
17:52	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
Judah	1
arose,	1
and	1
shouted,	1
and	1
pursued	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Ekron.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
wounded	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fell	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Shaaraim,	1
even	1
unto	1
Gath,	1
and	1
unto	1
Ekron.	1
	1
17:53	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
returned	1
from	1
chasing	1
after	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
they	1
spoiled	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
17:54	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
but	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
17:55	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
David	1
go	1
forth	1
against	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Abner,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
Abner,	1
whose	1
son	1
is	1
this	1
youth?	1
And	1
Abner	1
said,	1
As	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
	1
17:56	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Enquire	1
thou	1
whose	1
son	1
the	1
stripling	1
is.	1
	1
17:57	1
And	1
as	1
David	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
Abner	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
before	1
Saul	1
with	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
17:58	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Whose	1
son	1
art	1
thou,	1
thou	1
young	1
man?	1
And	1
David	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
Jesse	1
the	1
Bethlehemite.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
knit	1
with	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Saul	1
took	1
him	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
18:3	1
Then	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
David	1
made	1
a	1
covenant,	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
stripped	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
his	1
garments,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
bow,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
girdle.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
out	1
whithersoever	1
Saul	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
behaved	1
himself	1
wisely:	1
and	1
Saul	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Saul's	1
servants.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
they	1
came,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
singing	1
and	1
dancing,	1
to	1
meet	1
king	1
Saul,	1
with	1
tabrets,	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
answered	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
they	1
played,	1
and	1
said,	1
Saul	1
hath	1
slain	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
the	1
saying	1
displeased	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
They	1
have	1
ascribed	1
unto	1
David	1
ten	1
thousands,	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
have	1
ascribed	1
but	1
thousands:	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
more	1
but	1
the	1
kingdom?	1
18:9	1
And	1
Saul	1
eyed	1
David	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
forward.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
and	1
he	1
prophesied	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
David	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
javelin	1
in	1
Saul's	1
hand.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
Saul	1
cast	1
the	1
javelin;	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
David	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
it.	1
And	1
David	1
avoided	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
twice.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
David,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
Saul.	1
	1
18:13	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
removed	1
him	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
his	1
captain	1
over	1
a	1
thousand;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
David	1
behaved	1
himself	1
wisely	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
18:15	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
behaved	1
himself	1
very	1
wisely,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah	1
loved	1
David,	1
because	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Behold	1
my	1
elder	1
daughter	1
Merab,	1
her	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
to	1
wife:	1
only	1
be	1
thou	1
valiant	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
fight	1
the	1
LORD's	1
battles.	1
	1
For	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
mine	1
hand	1
be	1
upon	1
him,	1
but	1
let	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
be	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Who	1
am	1
I?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
life,	1
or	1
my	1
father's	1
family	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
the	1
king?	1
18:19	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Merab	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
David,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
Adriel	1
the	1
Meholathite	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
loved	1
David:	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
snare	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
may	1
be	1
against	1
him.	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twain.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
Saul	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Commune	1
with	1
David	1
secretly,	1
and	1
say,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
delight	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
love	1
thee:	1
now	1
therefore	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
Saul's	1
servants	1
spake	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Seemeth	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
and	1
lightly	1
esteemed?	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
On	1
this	1
manner	1
spake	1
David.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
David,	1
The	1
king	1
desireth	1
not	1
any	1
dowry,	1
but	1
an	1
hundred	1
foreskins	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
to	1
be	1
avenged	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
enemies.	1
But	1
Saul	1
thought	1
to	1
make	1
David	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
servants	1
told	1
David	1
these	1
words,	1
it	1
pleased	1
David	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law:	1
and	1
the	1
days	1
were	1
not	1
expired.	1
	1
18:27	1
Wherefore	1
David	1
arose	1
and	1
went,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
and	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
two	1
hundred	1
men;	1
and	1
David	1
brought	1
their	1
foreskins,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
in	1
full	1
tale	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law.	1
And	1
Saul	1
gave	1
him	1
Michal	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
Saul	1
saw	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
that	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
loved	1
him.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
yet	1
the	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
Saul	1
became	1
David's	1
enemy	1
continually.	1
	1
18:30	1
Then	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
forth:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
that	1
David	1
behaved	1
himself	1
more	1
wisely	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul;	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
much	1
set	1
by.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
spake	1
to	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
David.	1
	1
19:2	1
But	1
Jonathan	1
Saul's	1
son	1
delighted	1
much	1
in	1
David:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
seeketh	1
to	1
kill	1
thee:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
thyself	1
until	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place,	1
and	1
hide	1
thyself:	1
19:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
stand	1
beside	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
where	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
commune	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
see,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
spake	1
good	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
Saul	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
sin	1
against	1
his	1
servant,	1
against	1
David;	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
because	1
his	1
works	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
thee-ward	1
very	1
good:	1
19:5	1
For	1
he	1
did	1
put	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
wrought	1
a	1
great	1
salvation	1
for	1
all	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
sawest	1
it,	1
and	1
didst	1
rejoice:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
sin	1
against	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
to	1
slay	1
David	1
without	1
a	1
cause?	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
Saul	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Jonathan:	1
and	1
Saul	1
sware,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
called	1
David,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
shewed	1
him	1
all	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
brought	1
David	1
to	1
Saul,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
as	1
in	1
times	1
past.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
again:	1
and	1
David	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
Saul,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
with	1
his	1
javelin	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
David	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
Saul	1
sought	1
to	1
smite	1
David	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
the	1
javelin:	1
but	1
he	1
slipped	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
Saul's	1
presence,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
the	1
javelin	1
into	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
David	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
19:11	1
Saul	1
also	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
David's	1
house,	1
to	1
watch	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
and	1
Michal	1
David's	1
wife	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
save	1
not	1
thy	1
life	1
to	1
night,	1
to	1
morrow	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
19:12	1
So	1
Michal	1
let	1
David	1
down	1
through	1
a	1
window:	1
and	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
Michal	1
took	1
an	1
image,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
pillow	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair	1
for	1
his	1
bolster,	1
and	1
covered	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
cloth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
take	1
David,	1
she	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
the	1
messengers	1
again	1
to	1
see	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
image	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
with	1
a	1
pillow	1
of	1
goats'	1
hair	1
for	1
his	1
bolster.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Michal,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
deceived	1
me	1
so,	1
and	1
sent	1
away	1
mine	1
enemy,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
escaped?	1
And	1
Michal	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
me	1
go;	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
kill	1
thee?	1
	1
19:18	1
So	1
David	1
fled,	1
and	1
escaped,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samuel	1
to	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
and	1
Samuel	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Naioth.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
is	1
at	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
take	1
David:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesying,	1
and	1
Samuel	1
standing	1
as	1
appointed	1
over	1
them,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul,	1
he	1
sent	1
other	1
messengers,	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
likewise.	1
And	1
Saul	1
sent	1
messengers	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
also.	1
	1
19:22	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
also	1
to	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
well	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Sechu:	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
are	1
Samuel	1
and	1
David?	1
And	1
one	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
they	1
be	1
at	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
thither	1
to	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah:	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
prophesied,	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
he	1
stripped	1
off	1
his	1
clothes	1
also,	1
and	1
prophesied	1
before	1
Samuel	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
naked	1
all	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
night.	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
say,	1
Is	1
Saul	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
prophets?	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
David	1
fled	1
from	1
Naioth	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
Jonathan,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
what	1
is	1
mine	1
iniquity?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
sin	1
before	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life?	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
forbid;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die:	1
behold,	1
my	1
father	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
either	1
great	1
or	1
small,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
it	1
me:	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
my	1
father	1
hide	1
this	1
thing	1
from	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
David	1
sware	1
moreover,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
father	1
certainly	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes;	1
and	1
he	1
saith,	1
Let	1
not	1
Jonathan	1
know	1
this,	1
lest	1
he	1
be	1
grieved:	1
but	1
truly	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
20:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Jonathan	1
unto	1
David,	1
Whatsoever	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Jonathan,	1
Behold,	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
at	1
meat:	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
hide	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
unto	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
at	1
even.	1
	1
20:6	1
If	1
thy	1
father	1
at	1
all	1
miss	1
me,	1
then	1
say,	1
David	1
earnestly	1
asked	1
leave	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
run	1
to	1
Bethlehem	1
his	1
city:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
yearly	1
sacrifice	1
there	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
family.	1
	1
20:7	1
If	1
he	1
say	1
thus,	1
It	1
is	1
well;	1
thy	1
servant	1
shall	1
have	1
peace:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
very	1
wroth,	1
then	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
evil	1
is	1
determined	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
20:8	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deal	1
kindly	1
with	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
thy	1
servant	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
thee:	1
notwithstanding,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
me	1
iniquity,	1
slay	1
me	1
thyself;	1
for	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
thy	1
father?	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said,	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
certainly	1
that	1
evil	1
were	1
determined	1
by	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
then	1
would	1
not	1
I	1
tell	1
it	1
thee?	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
said	1
David	1
to	1
Jonathan,	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
me?	1
or	1
what	1
if	1
thy	1
father	1
answer	1
thee	1
roughly?	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
sounded	1
my	1
father	1
about	1
to	1
morrow	1
any	1
time,	1
or	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
good	1
toward	1
David,	1
and	1
I	1
then	1
send	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shew	1
it	1
thee;	1
20:13	1
The	1
LORD	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
Jonathan:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
do	1
thee	1
evil,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
it	1
thee,	1
and	1
send	1
thee	1
away,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
go	1
in	1
peace:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
only	1
while	1
yet	1
I	1
live	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
die	1
not:	1
20:15	1
But	1
also	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
kindness	1
from	1
my	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
no,	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
David	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
20:16	1
So	1
Jonathan	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
the	1
LORD	1
even	1
require	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David's	1
enemies.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
caused	1
David	1
to	1
swear	1
again,	1
because	1
he	1
loved	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
soul.	1
	1
20:18	1
Then	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
To	1
morrow	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
moon:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
missed,	1
because	1
thy	1
seat	1
will	1
be	1
empty.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
stayed	1
three	1
days,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
down	1
quickly,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
didst	1
hide	1
thyself	1
when	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
shalt	1
remain	1
by	1
the	1
stone	1
Ezel.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shoot	1
three	1
arrows	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
thereof,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
shot	1
at	1
a	1
mark.	1
	1
20:21	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
lad,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
arrows.	1
If	1
I	1
expressly	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
lad,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
arrows	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
thee,	1
take	1
them;	1
then	1
come	1
thou:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
peace	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
hurt;	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth.	1
	1
20:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
thus	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
arrows	1
are	1
beyond	1
thee;	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
thee	1
away.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
matter	1
which	1
thou	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
me	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
20:24	1
So	1
David	1
hid	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
meat.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
seat,	1
as	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
even	1
upon	1
a	1
seat	1
by	1
the	1
wall:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
arose,	1
and	1
Abner	1
sat	1
by	1
Saul's	1
side,	1
and	1
David's	1
place	1
was	1
empty.	1
	1
20:26	1
Nevertheless	1
Saul	1
spake	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
he	1
thought,	1
Something	1
hath	1
befallen	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
clean;	1
surely	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
clean.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
David's	1
place	1
was	1
empty:	1
and	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
Wherefore	1
cometh	1
not	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
to	1
meat,	1
neither	1
yesterday,	1
nor	1
to	1
day?	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
answered	1
Saul,	1
David	1
earnestly	1
asked	1
leave	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bethlehem:	1
20:29	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
me	1
go,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
for	1
our	1
family	1
hath	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
my	1
brother,	1
he	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
there:	1
and	1
now,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
let	1
me	1
get	1
away,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
brethren.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
cometh	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
table.	1
	1
20:30	1
Then	1
Saul's	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
perverse	1
rebellious	1
woman,	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
confusion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
thy	1
mother's	1
nakedness?	1
	1
20:31	1
For	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
liveth	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
established,	1
nor	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him	1
unto	1
me,	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
answered	1
Saul	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
slain?	1
what	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
	1
20:33	1
And	1
Saul	1
cast	1
a	1
javelin	1
at	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him:	1
whereby	1
Jonathan	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
slay	1
David.	1
	1
20:34	1
So	1
Jonathan	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
no	1
meat	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
David,	1
because	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
him	1
shame.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
lad	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
lad,	1
Run,	1
find	1
out	1
now	1
the	1
arrows	1
which	1
I	1
shoot.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lad	1
ran,	1
he	1
shot	1
an	1
arrow	1
beyond	1
him.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
arrow	1
which	1
Jonathan	1
had	1
shot,	1
Jonathan	1
cried	1
after	1
the	1
lad,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
arrow	1
beyond	1
thee?	1
	1
20:38	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
cried	1
after	1
the	1
lad,	1
Make	1
speed,	1
haste,	1
stay	1
not.	1
And	1
Jonathan's	1
lad	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
arrows,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
20:39	1
But	1
the	1
lad	1
knew	1
not	1
any	1
thing:	1
only	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
David	1
knew	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
gave	1
his	1
artillery	1
unto	1
his	1
lad,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
gone,	1
David	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
they	1
kissed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
wept	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
until	1
David	1
exceeded.	1
	1
20:42	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
sworn	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
be	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
between	1
my	1
seed	1
and	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
departed:	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
21:1	1
Then	1
came	1
David	1
to	1
Nob	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest:	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
was	1
afraid	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou	1
alone,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest,	1
The	1
king	1
hath	1
commanded	1
me	1
a	1
business,	1
and	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
whereabout	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
appointed	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
place.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
what	1
is	1
under	1
thine	1
hand?	1
give	1
me	1
five	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
or	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
present.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
answered	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
common	1
bread	1
under	1
mine	1
hand,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
hallowed	1
bread;	1
if	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
kept	1
themselves	1
at	1
least	1
from	1
women.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
women	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
from	1
us	1
about	1
these	1
three	1
days,	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
are	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
common,	1
yea,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
sanctified	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
vessel.	1
	1
21:6	1
So	1
the	1
priest	1
gave	1
him	1
hallowed	1
bread:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
there	1
but	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
that	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
put	1
hot	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
21:7	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
day,	1
detained	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Doeg,	1
an	1
Edomite,	1
the	1
chiefest	1
of	1
the	1
herdmen	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
Saul.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahimelech,	1
And	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
here	1
under	1
thine	1
hand	1
spear	1
or	1
sword?	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
brought	1
my	1
sword	1
nor	1
my	1
weapons	1
with	1
me,	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
business	1
required	1
haste.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
said,	1
The	1
sword	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
whom	1
thou	1
slewest	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Elah,	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
cloth	1
behind	1
the	1
ephod:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
that,	1
take	1
it:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
save	1
that	1
here.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
that;	1
give	1
it	1
me.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
David	1
arose	1
and	1
fled	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Achish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
sing	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
dances,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
hath	1
slain	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands?	1
21:12	1
And	1
David	1
laid	1
up	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid	1
of	1
Achish	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
behaviour	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
feigned	1
himself	1
mad	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
scrabbled	1
on	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
spittle	1
fall	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
beard.	1
	1
21:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Achish	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Lo,	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
mad:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
have	1
ye	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
21:15	1
Have	1
I	1
need	1
of	1
mad	1
men,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
fellow	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
mad	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
presence?	1
shall	1
this	1
fellow	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house?	1
	1
22:1	1
David	1
therefore	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
escaped	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
Adullam:	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
thither	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
distress,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
debt,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
discontented,	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
captain	1
over	1
them:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
men.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
thence	1
to	1
Mizpeh	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab,	1
Let	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
till	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
God	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
Gad	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Abide	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
hold;	1
depart,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
Then	1
David	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Hareth.	1
	1
22:6	1
When	1
Saul	1
heard	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(now	1
Saul	1
abode	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
having	1
his	1
spear	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
were	1
standing	1
about	1
him;)	1
22:7	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
stood	1
about	1
him,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
ye	1
Benjamites;	1
will	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
give	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
fields	1
and	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
all	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds;	1
22:8	1
That	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
have	1
conspired	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
sheweth	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
hath	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
sorry	1
for	1
me,	1
or	1
sheweth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
hath	1
stirred	1
up	1
my	1
servant	1
against	1
me,	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
answered	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite,	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
coming	1
to	1
Nob,	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
victuals,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Philistine.	1
	1
22:11	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
to	1
call	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
priest,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house,	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Nob:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Hear	1
now,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Here	1
I	1
am,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
Saul	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
conspired	1
against	1
me,	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
hast	1
enquired	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rise	1
against	1
me,	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
wait,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
22:14	1
Then	1
Ahimelech	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
faithful	1
among	1
all	1
thy	1
servants	1
as	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
goeth	1
at	1
thy	1
bidding,	1
and	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
thine	1
house?	1
	1
22:15	1
Did	1
I	1
then	1
begin	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
him?	1
be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
me:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
impute	1
any	1
thing	1
unto	1
his	1
servant,	1
nor	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
father:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
less	1
or	1
more.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die,	1
Ahimelech,	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
footmen	1
that	1
stood	1
about	1
him,	1
Turn,	1
and	1
slay	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
because	1
their	1
hand	1
also	1
is	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
when	1
he	1
fled,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
shew	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Doeg,	1
Turn	1
thou,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
priests.	1
And	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite	1
turned,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
slew	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
persons	1
that	1
did	1
wear	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
Nob,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
smote	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
children	1
and	1
sucklings,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
asses,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
named	1
Abiathar,	1
escaped,	1
and	1
fled	1
after	1
David.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
Abiathar	1
shewed	1
David	1
that	1
Saul	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
LORD's	1
priests.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Abiathar,	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
that	1
day,	1
when	1
Doeg	1
the	1
Edomite	1
was	1
there,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
surely	1
tell	1
Saul:	1
I	1
have	1
occasioned	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
22:23	1
Abide	1
thou	1
with	1
me,	1
fear	1
not:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life	1
seeketh	1
thy	1
life:	1
but	1
with	1
me	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
in	1
safeguard.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
they	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fight	1
against	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
they	1
rob	1
the	1
threshingfloors.	1
	1
23:2	1
Therefore	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
smite	1
these	1
Philistines?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
save	1
Keilah.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
David's	1
men	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
be	1
afraid	1
here	1
in	1
Judah:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
then	1
if	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah	1
against	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
	1
23:4	1
Then	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
yet	1
again.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Keilah;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
Philistines	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
23:5	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
brought	1
away	1
their	1
cattle,	1
and	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
So	1
David	1
saved	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Keilah.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahimelech	1
fled	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
ephod	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah.	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
mine	1
hand;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
shut	1
in,	1
by	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
town	1
that	1
hath	1
gates	1
and	1
bars.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together	1
to	1
war,	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
to	1
besiege	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
David	1
knew	1
that	1
Saul	1
secretly	1
practised	1
mischief	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
Bring	1
hither	1
the	1
ephod.	1
	1
23:10	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
certainly	1
heard	1
that	1
Saul	1
seeketh	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Keilah,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
	1
23:11	1
Will	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Keilah	1
deliver	1
me	1
up	1
into	1
his	1
hand?	1
will	1
Saul	1
come	1
down,	1
as	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
heard?	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
tell	1
thy	1
servant.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
He	1
will	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
23:12	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
Will	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Keilah	1
deliver	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
men	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
They	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
up.	1
	1
23:13	1
Then	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
six	1
hundred,	1
arose	1
and	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
Keilah,	1
and	1
went	1
whithersoever	1
they	1
could	1
go.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
escaped	1
from	1
Keilah;	1
and	1
he	1
forbare	1
to	1
go	1
forth.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
in	1
strong	1
holds,	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
a	1
mountain	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph.	1
And	1
Saul	1
sought	1
him	1
every	1
day,	1
but	1
God	1
delivered	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
David	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
life:	1
and	1
David	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph	1
in	1
a	1
wood.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
Saul's	1
son	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
David	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
next	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
that	1
also	1
Saul	1
my	1
father	1
knoweth.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
they	1
two	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
Ziphites	1
to	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gibeah,	1
saying,	1
Doth	1
not	1
David	1
hide	1
himself	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
strong	1
holds	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Jeshimon?	1
	1
23:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
king,	1
come	1
down	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
thy	1
soul	1
to	1
come	1
down;	1
and	1
our	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
hand.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
23:22	1
Go,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
prepare	1
yet,	1
and	1
know	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
place	1
where	1
his	1
haunt	1
is,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
seen	1
him	1
there:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
dealeth	1
very	1
subtilly.	1
	1
23:23	1
See	1
therefore,	1
and	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
lurking	1
places	1
where	1
he	1
hideth	1
himself,	1
and	1
come	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
certainty,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
him	1
out	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
they	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Ziph	1
before	1
Saul:	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon,	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Jeshimon.	1
	1
23:25	1
Saul	1
also	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
seek	1
him.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
David;	1
wherefore	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon.	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
pursued	1
after	1
David	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Maon.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
Saul	1
went	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain:	1
and	1
David	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
Saul;	1
for	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
compassed	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
them.	1
	1
23:27	1
But	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Haste	1
thee,	1
and	1
come;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
have	1
invaded	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:28	1
Wherefore	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
pursuing	1
after	1
David,	1
and	1
went	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
therefore	1
they	1
called	1
that	1
place	1
Selahammahlekoth.	1
	1
23:29	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
strong	1
holds	1
at	1
Engedi.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Engedi.	1
	1
24:2	1
Then	1
Saul	1
took	1
three	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
seek	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
upon	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
goats.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sheepcotes	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
cave;	1
and	1
Saul	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
feet:	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
cave.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thine	1
enemy	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
Then	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
Saul's	1
robe	1
privily.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
David's	1
heart	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
off	1
Saul's	1
skirt.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
men,	1
The	1
LORD	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
my	1
master,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed,	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
anointed	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:7	1
So	1
David	1
stayed	1
his	1
servants	1
with	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
suffered	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
rise	1
against	1
Saul.	1
But	1
Saul	1
rose	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
24:8	1
David	1
also	1
arose	1
afterward,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
and	1
cried	1
after	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
My	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
David	1
stooped	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Wherefore	1
hearest	1
thou	1
men's	1
words,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
seeketh	1
thy	1
hurt?	1
	1
24:10	1
Behold,	1
this	1
day	1
thine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
delivered	1
thee	1
to	1
day	1
into	1
mine	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
cave:	1
and	1
some	1
bade	1
me	1
kill	1
thee:	1
but	1
mine	1
eye	1
spared	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
my	1
lord;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
24:11	1
Moreover,	1
my	1
father,	1
see,	1
yea,	1
see	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
thy	1
robe	1
in	1
my	1
hand:	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
thy	1
robe,	1
and	1
killed	1
thee	1
not,	1
know	1
thou	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
evil	1
nor	1
transgression	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee;	1
yet	1
thou	1
huntest	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
24:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
avenge	1
me	1
of	1
thee:	1
but	1
mine	1
hand	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
24:13	1
As	1
saith	1
the	1
proverb	1
of	1
the	1
ancients,	1
Wickedness	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
wicked:	1
but	1
mine	1
hand	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
24:14	1
After	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
come	1
out?	1
after	1
whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
pursue?	1
after	1
a	1
dead	1
dog,	1
after	1
a	1
flea.	1
	1
24:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
therefore	1
be	1
judge,	1
and	1
judge	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
see,	1
and	1
plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
that	1
Saul	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
voice,	1
my	1
son	1
David?	1
And	1
Saul	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
I:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
rewarded	1
me	1
good,	1
whereas	1
I	1
have	1
rewarded	1
thee	1
evil.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
this	1
day	1
how	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
me:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
delivered	1
me	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
thou	1
killedst	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
24:19	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
find	1
his	1
enemy,	1
will	1
he	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
well	1
away?	1
wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
reward	1
thee	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
be	1
king,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
24:21	1
Swear	1
now	1
therefore	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
seed	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
destroy	1
my	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
David	1
sware	1
unto	1
Saul.	1
And	1
Saul	1
went	1
home;	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
gat	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
Samuel	1
died;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
lamented	1
him,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Ramah.	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Paran.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Maon,	1
whose	1
possessions	1
were	1
in	1
Carmel;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
three	1
thousand	1
sheep,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
goats:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
shearing	1
his	1
sheep	1
in	1
Carmel.	1
	1
25:3	1
Now	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
Nabal;	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
Abigail:	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
good	1
understanding,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
beautiful	1
countenance:	1
but	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
churlish	1
and	1
evil	1
in	1
his	1
doings;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Caleb.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
David	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
that	1
Nabal	1
did	1
shear	1
his	1
sheep.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
out	1
ten	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
Get	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
greet	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
25:6	1
And	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
Peace	1
be	1
both	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
to	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shearers:	1
now	1
thy	1
shepherds	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
hurt	1
them	1
not,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
ought	1
missing	1
unto	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
Carmel.	1
	1
25:8	1
Ask	1
thy	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
shew	1
thee.	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes:	1
for	1
we	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
day:	1
give,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
whatsoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
thine	1
hand	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
son	1
David.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
when	1
David's	1
young	1
men	1
came,	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
Nabal	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
ceased.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
Nabal	1
answered	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
David?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse?	1
there	1
be	1
many	1
servants	1
now	1
a	1
days	1
that	1
break	1
away	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
25:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
my	1
bread,	1
and	1
my	1
water,	1
and	1
my	1
flesh	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
killed	1
for	1
my	1
shearers,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
men,	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whence	1
they	1
be?	1
	1
25:12	1
So	1
David's	1
young	1
men	1
turned	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
went	1
again,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
those	1
sayings.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
men,	1
Gird	1
ye	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword.	1
And	1
they	1
girded	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
sword;	1
and	1
David	1
also	1
girded	1
on	1
his	1
sword:	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
after	1
David	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
men;	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
abode	1
by	1
the	1
stuff.	1
	1
25:14	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
told	1
Abigail,	1
Nabal's	1
wife,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
salute	1
our	1
master;	1
and	1
he	1
railed	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
25:15	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
very	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
hurt,	1
neither	1
missed	1
we	1
any	1
thing,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
conversant	1
with	1
them,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields:	1
25:16	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
wall	1
unto	1
us	1
both	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
them	1
keeping	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
25:17	1
Now	1
therefore	1
know	1
and	1
consider	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do;	1
for	1
evil	1
is	1
determined	1
against	1
our	1
master,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
his	1
household:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Belial,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
25:18	1
Then	1
Abigail	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
took	1
two	1
hundred	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
five	1
sheep	1
ready	1
dressed,	1
and	1
five	1
measures	1
of	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
clusters	1
of	1
raisins,	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
cakes	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
asses.	1
	1
25:19	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
servants,	1
Go	1
on	1
before	1
me;	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
after	1
you.	1
But	1
she	1
told	1
not	1
her	1
husband	1
Nabal.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
as	1
she	1
rode	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
covert	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
came	1
down	1
against	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
met	1
them.	1
	1
25:21	1
Now	1
David	1
had	1
said,	1
Surely	1
in	1
vain	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
fellow	1
hath	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
so	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
missed	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
requited	1
me	1
evil	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
25:22	1
So	1
and	1
more	1
also	1
do	1
God	1
unto	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
David,	1
if	1
I	1
leave	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
any	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
when	1
Abigail	1
saw	1
David,	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
lighted	1
off	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
David	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
25:24	1
And	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Upon	1
me,	1
my	1
lord,	1
upon	1
me	1
let	1
this	1
iniquity	1
be:	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
in	1
thine	1
audience,	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
25:25	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
regard	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
Belial,	1
even	1
Nabal:	1
for	1
as	1
his	1
name	1
is,	1
so	1
is	1
he;	1
Nabal	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
folly	1
is	1
with	1
him:	1
but	1
I	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
whom	1
thou	1
didst	1
send.	1
	1
25:26	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
my	1
lord,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
withholden	1
thee	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
shed	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
avenging	1
thyself	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
hand,	1
now	1
let	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
seek	1
evil	1
to	1
my	1
lord,	1
be	1
as	1
Nabal.	1
	1
25:27	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
blessing	1
which	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
hath	1
brought	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
let	1
it	1
even	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
follow	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
25:28	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
forgive	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
certainly	1
make	1
my	1
lord	1
a	1
sure	1
house;	1
because	1
my	1
lord	1
fighteth	1
the	1
battles	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
thee	1
all	1
thy	1
days.	1
	1
25:29	1
Yet	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
risen	1
to	1
pursue	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
thy	1
soul:	1
but	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
life	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
them	1
shall	1
he	1
sling	1
out,	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sling.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
my	1
lord	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
have	1
appointed	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
Israel;	1
25:31	1
That	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
grief	1
unto	1
thee,	1
nor	1
offence	1
of	1
heart	1
unto	1
my	1
lord,	1
either	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shed	1
blood	1
causeless,	1
or	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
hath	1
avenged	1
himself:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
have	1
dealt	1
well	1
with	1
my	1
lord,	1
then	1
remember	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
25:32	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abigail,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
sent	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
to	1
meet	1
me:	1
25:33	1
And	1
blessed	1
be	1
thy	1
advice,	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
thou,	1
which	1
hast	1
kept	1
me	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
shed	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
avenging	1
myself	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
25:34	1
For	1
in	1
very	1
deed,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
liveth,	1
which	1
hath	1
kept	1
me	1
back	1
from	1
hurting	1
thee,	1
except	1
thou	1
hadst	1
hasted	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
meet	1
me,	1
surely	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
left	1
unto	1
Nabal	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
any	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
25:35	1
So	1
David	1
received	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go	1
up	1
in	1
peace	1
to	1
thine	1
house;	1
see,	1
I	1
have	1
hearkened	1
to	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
have	1
accepted	1
thy	1
person.	1
	1
25:36	1
And	1
Abigail	1
came	1
to	1
Nabal;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
feast	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
like	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
a	1
king;	1
and	1
Nabal's	1
heart	1
was	1
merry	1
within	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
drunken:	1
wherefore	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
nothing,	1
less	1
or	1
more,	1
until	1
the	1
morning	1
light.	1
	1
25:37	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
wine	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
died	1
within	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
25:38	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
ten	1
days	1
after,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
Nabal,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
25:39	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
that	1
Nabal	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hath	1
pleaded	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
reproach	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nabal,	1
and	1
hath	1
kept	1
his	1
servant	1
from	1
evil:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
returned	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Nabal	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
Abigail,	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
25:40	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Abigail	1
to	1
Carmel,	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
her,	1
saying,	1
David	1
sent	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
take	1
thee	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
25:41	1
And	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
let	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
25:42	1
And	1
Abigail	1
hasted,	1
and	1
arose	1
and	1
rode	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
with	1
five	1
damsels	1
of	1
hers	1
that	1
went	1
after	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
became	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
25:43	1
David	1
also	1
took	1
Ahinoam	1
of	1
Jezreel;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
his	1
wives.	1
	1
25:44	1
But	1
Saul	1
had	1
given	1
Michal	1
his	1
daughter,	1
David's	1
wife,	1
to	1
Phalti	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Laish,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Gallim.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
the	1
Ziphites	1
came	1
unto	1
Saul	1
to	1
Gibeah,	1
saying,	1
Doth	1
not	1
David	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jeshimon?	1
	1
26:2	1
Then	1
Saul	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph,	1
having	1
three	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
seek	1
David	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Ziph.	1
	1
26:3	1
And	1
Saul	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Hachilah,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jeshimon,	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
But	1
David	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
came	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
26:4	1
David	1
therefore	1
sent	1
out	1
spies,	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
in	1
very	1
deed.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Saul	1
had	1
pitched:	1
and	1
David	1
beheld	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Saul	1
lay,	1
and	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
his	1
host:	1
and	1
Saul	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
trench,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
pitched	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
26:6	1
Then	1
answered	1
David	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
Hittite,	1
and	1
to	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
brother	1
to	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
camp?	1
And	1
Abishai	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
26:7	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
Abishai	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
night:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
lay	1
sleeping	1
within	1
the	1
trench,	1
and	1
his	1
spear	1
stuck	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
his	1
bolster:	1
but	1
Abner	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
lay	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
26:8	1
Then	1
said	1
Abishai	1
to	1
David,	1
God	1
hath	1
delivered	1
thine	1
enemy	1
into	1
thine	1
hand	1
this	1
day:	1
now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
smite	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
the	1
spear	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smite	1
him	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
26:9	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
Destroy	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed,	1
and	1
be	1
guiltless?	1
	1
26:10	1
David	1
said	1
furthermore,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
him;	1
or	1
his	1
day	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
die;	1
or	1
he	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
battle,	1
and	1
perish.	1
	1
26:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed:	1
but,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
take	1
thou	1
now	1
the	1
spear	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
bolster,	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go.	1
	1
26:12	1
So	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
spear	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water	1
from	1
Saul's	1
bolster;	1
and	1
they	1
gat	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
saw	1
it,	1
nor	1
knew	1
it,	1
neither	1
awaked:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
asleep;	1
because	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
26:13	1
Then	1
David	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill	1
afar	1
off;	1
a	1
great	1
space	1
being	1
between	1
them:	1
26:14	1
And	1
David	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
not,	1
Abner?	1
Then	1
Abner	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
criest	1
to	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abner,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
a	1
valiant	1
man?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
Israel?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
kept	1
thy	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
for	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
king	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
26:16	1
This	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done.	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
ye	1
are	1
worthy	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
your	1
master,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
And	1
now	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
king's	1
spear	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
bolster.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
Saul	1
knew	1
David's	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
voice,	1
my	1
son	1
David?	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
voice,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
doth	1
my	1
lord	1
thus	1
pursue	1
after	1
his	1
servant?	1
	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
or	1
what	1
evil	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
26:19	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
servant.	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
have	1
stirred	1
thee	1
up	1
against	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
accept	1
an	1
offering:	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men,	1
cursed	1
be	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
driven	1
me	1
out	1
this	1
day	1
from	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
serve	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
26:20	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
let	1
not	1
my	1
blood	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
flea,	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
doth	1
hunt	1
a	1
partridge	1
in	1
the	1
mountains.	1
	1
26:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
return,	1
my	1
son	1
David:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
do	1
thee	1
harm,	1
because	1
my	1
soul	1
was	1
precious	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
played	1
the	1
fool,	1
and	1
have	1
erred	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
king's	1
spear!	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
come	1
over	1
and	1
fetch	1
it.	1
	1
26:23	1
The	1
LORD	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
righteousness	1
and	1
his	1
faithfulness;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
thee	1
into	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
day,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
stretch	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
26:24	1
And,	1
behold,	1
as	1
thy	1
life	1
was	1
much	1
set	1
by	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
so	1
let	1
my	1
life	1
be	1
much	1
set	1
by	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
tribulation.	1
	1
26:25	1
Then	1
Saul	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou,	1
my	1
son	1
David:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
do	1
great	1
things,	1
and	1
also	1
shalt	1
still	1
prevail.	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
perish	1
one	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
than	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
speedily	1
escape	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
Saul	1
shall	1
despair	1
of	1
me,	1
to	1
seek	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
any	1
coast	1
of	1
Israel:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
with	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maoch,	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
David	1
dwelt	1
with	1
Achish	1
at	1
Gath,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
household,	1
even	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
wives,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
the	1
Carmelitess,	1
Nabal's	1
wife.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Saul	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
fled	1
to	1
Gath:	1
and	1
he	1
sought	1
no	1
more	1
again	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
some	1
town	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
dwell	1
there:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
thy	1
servant	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
city	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
27:6	1
Then	1
Achish	1
gave	1
him	1
Ziklag	1
that	1
day:	1
wherefore	1
Ziklag	1
pertaineth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
David	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
year	1
and	1
four	1
months.	1
	1
27:8	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
invaded	1
the	1
Geshurites,	1
and	1
the	1
Gezrites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amalekites:	1
for	1
those	1
nations	1
were	1
of	1
old	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
Shur,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
David	1
smote	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
left	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
alive,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
the	1
asses,	1
and	1
the	1
camels,	1
and	1
the	1
apparel,	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Achish.	1
	1
27:10	1
And	1
Achish	1
said,	1
Whither	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
a	1
road	1
to	1
day?	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Jerahmeelites,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Kenites.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
David	1
saved	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
woman	1
alive,	1
to	1
bring	1
tidings	1
to	1
Gath,	1
saying,	1
Lest	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
on	1
us,	1
saying,	1
So	1
did	1
David,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
manner	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
Achish	1
believed	1
David,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
made	1
his	1
people	1
Israel	1
utterly	1
to	1
abhor	1
him;	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
servant	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
their	1
armies	1
together	1
for	1
warfare,	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
Israel.	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Know	1
thou	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
battle,	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
men.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Achish,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
servant	1
can	1
do.	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
keeper	1
of	1
mine	1
head	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:3	1
Now	1
Samuel	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
had	1
lamented	1
him,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
Ramah,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
And	1
Saul	1
had	1
put	1
away	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
wizards,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Shunem:	1
and	1
Saul	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
they	1
pitched	1
in	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
saw	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
greatly	1
trembled.	1
	1
28:6	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
dreams,	1
nor	1
by	1
Urim,	1
nor	1
by	1
prophets.	1
	1
28:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Seek	1
me	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
enquire	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit	1
at	1
Endor.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
other	1
raiment,	1
and	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
two	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
by	1
night:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
divine	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
him	1
up,	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
name	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
what	1
Saul	1
hath	1
done,	1
how	1
he	1
hath	1
cut	1
off	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
wizards,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
layest	1
thou	1
a	1
snare	1
for	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
die?	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
Saul	1
sware	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
punishment	1
happen	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
28:11	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
woman,	1
Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
bring	1
up	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
me	1
up	1
Samuel.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
Samuel,	1
she	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
spake	1
to	1
Saul,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
deceived	1
me?	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
Saul.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid:	1
for	1
what	1
sawest	1
thou?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
I	1
saw	1
gods	1
ascending	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
28:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
form	1
is	1
he	1
of?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
An	1
old	1
man	1
cometh	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
mantle.	1
And	1
Saul	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
he	1
stooped	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
Samuel	1
said	1
to	1
Saul,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
disquieted	1
me,	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
up?	1
And	1
Saul	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
sore	1
distressed;	1
for	1
the	1
Philistines	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
answereth	1
me	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
by	1
prophets,	1
nor	1
by	1
dreams:	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
28:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Samuel,	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
dost	1
thou	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
seeing	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
thine	1
enemy?	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
me:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
rent	1
the	1
kingdom	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
even	1
to	1
David:	1
28:18	1
Because	1
thou	1
obeyedst	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
executedst	1
his	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
upon	1
Amalek,	1
therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
thee	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:19	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
also	1
deliver	1
Israel	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
shalt	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
be	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
deliver	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
28:20	1
Then	1
Saul	1
fell	1
straightway	1
all	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Samuel:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
no	1
bread	1
all	1
the	1
day,	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
came	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
troubled,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
hath	1
obeyed	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thy	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
spakest	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
28:22	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
hearken	1
thou	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
set	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
eat,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
have	1
strength,	1
when	1
thou	1
goest	1
on	1
thy	1
way.	1
	1
28:23	1
But	1
he	1
refused,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
eat.	1
But	1
his	1
servants,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
compelled	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
their	1
voice.	1
So	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
a	1
fat	1
calf	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
she	1
hasted,	1
and	1
killed	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
flour,	1
and	1
kneaded	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
thereof:	1
28:25	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
it	1
before	1
Saul,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
Then	1
they	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
29:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
their	1
armies	1
to	1
Aphek:	1
and	1
the	1
Israelites	1
pitched	1
by	1
a	1
fountain	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
passed	1
on	1
by	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
by	1
thousands:	1
but	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
passed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
rereward	1
with	1
Achish.	1
	1
29:3	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
Hebrews	1
here?	1
	1
And	1
Achish	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Saul	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
these	1
days,	1
or	1
these	1
years,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
fell	1
unto	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
day?	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
wroth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Make	1
this	1
fellow	1
return,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
appointed	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
battle,	1
lest	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
he	1
be	1
an	1
adversary	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
wherewith	1
should	1
he	1
reconcile	1
himself	1
unto	1
his	1
master?	1
should	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
these	1
men?	1
	1
29:5	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
David,	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
sang	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
dances,	1
saying,	1
Saul	1
slew	1
his	1
thousands,	1
and	1
David	1
his	1
ten	1
thousands?	1
	1
29:6	1
Then	1
Achish	1
called	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Surely,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
upright,	1
and	1
thy	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
host	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
sight:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
evil	1
in	1
thee	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
coming	1
unto	1
me	1
unto	1
this	1
day:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
lords	1
favour	1
thee	1
not.	1
	1
29:7	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
return,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
thou	1
displease	1
not	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Achish,	1
But	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
found	1
in	1
thy	1
servant	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
thee	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
go	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
29:9	1
And	1
Achish	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God:	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
have	1
said,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
29:10	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
rise	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
thy	1
master's	1
servants	1
that	1
are	1
come	1
with	1
thee:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
have	1
light,	1
depart.	1
	1
29:11	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
to	1
depart	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Ziklag	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
had	1
invaded	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
Ziklag,	1
and	1
smitten	1
Ziklag,	1
and	1
burned	1
it	1
with	1
fire;	1
30:2	1
And	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
women	1
captives,	1
that	1
were	1
therein:	1
they	1
slew	1
not	1
any,	1
either	1
great	1
or	1
small,	1
but	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
30:3	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
burned	1
with	1
fire;	1
and	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
were	1
taken	1
captives.	1
	1
30:4	1
Then	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
and	1
wept,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
power	1
to	1
weep.	1
	1
30:5	1
And	1
David's	1
two	1
wives	1
were	1
taken	1
captives,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nabal	1
the	1
Carmelite.	1
	1
30:6	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
greatly	1
distressed;	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
spake	1
of	1
stoning	1
him,	1
because	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
grieved,	1
every	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
daughters:	1
but	1
David	1
encouraged	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
Ahimelech's	1
son,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
bring	1
me	1
hither	1
the	1
ephod.	1
And	1
Abiathar	1
brought	1
thither	1
the	1
ephod	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
30:8	1
And	1
David	1
enquired	1
at	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
pursue	1
after	1
this	1
troop?	1
shall	1
I	1
overtake	1
them?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
Pursue:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
overtake	1
them,	1
and	1
without	1
fail	1
recover	1
all.	1
	1
30:9	1
So	1
David	1
went,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor,	1
where	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
stayed.	1
	1
30:10	1
But	1
David	1
pursued,	1
he	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
men:	1
for	1
two	1
hundred	1
abode	1
behind,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor.	1
	1
30:11	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
bread,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
drink	1
water;	1
30:12	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
figs,	1
and	1
two	1
clusters	1
of	1
raisins:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
eaten,	1
his	1
spirit	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
no	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drunk	1
any	1
water,	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights.	1
	1
30:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
To	1
whom	1
belongest	1
thou?	1
and	1
whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
servant	1
to	1
an	1
Amalekite;	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
left	1
me,	1
because	1
three	1
days	1
agone	1
I	1
fell	1
sick.	1
	1
30:14	1
We	1
made	1
an	1
invasion	1
upon	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
coast	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Caleb;	1
and	1
we	1
burned	1
Ziklag	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
30:15	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
company?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Swear	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
neither	1
kill	1
me,	1
nor	1
deliver	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
this	1
company.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
down,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
spread	1
abroad	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
dancing,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
spoil	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
30:17	1
And	1
David	1
smote	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
twilight	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
and	1
there	1
escaped	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
them,	1
save	1
four	1
hundred	1
young	1
men,	1
which	1
rode	1
upon	1
camels,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
30:18	1
And	1
David	1
recovered	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
had	1
carried	1
away:	1
and	1
David	1
rescued	1
his	1
two	1
wives.	1
	1
30:19	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
lacking	1
to	1
them,	1
neither	1
small	1
nor	1
great,	1
neither	1
sons	1
nor	1
daughters,	1
neither	1
spoil,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
them:	1
David	1
recovered	1
all.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
the	1
herds,	1
which	1
they	1
drave	1
before	1
those	1
other	1
cattle,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
David's	1
spoil.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
hundred	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
faint	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
follow	1
David,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
also	1
to	1
abide	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
Besor:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
David	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
saluted	1
them.	1
	1
30:22	1
Then	1
answered	1
all	1
the	1
wicked	1
men	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Belial,	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
went	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
Because	1
they	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
us,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
recovered,	1
save	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lead	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
depart.	1
	1
30:23	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
so,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
us,	1
who	1
hath	1
preserved	1
us,	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
company	1
that	1
came	1
against	1
us	1
into	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
30:24	1
For	1
who	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
matter?	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
part	1
is	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
battle,	1
so	1
shall	1
his	1
part	1
be	1
that	1
tarrieth	1
by	1
the	1
stuff:	1
they	1
shall	1
part	1
alike.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forward,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
statute	1
and	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
Israel	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
30:26	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Ziklag,	1
he	1
sent	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
a	1
present	1
for	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
30:27	1
To	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
south	1
Ramoth,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Jattir,	1
30:28	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Aroer,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Siphmoth,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Eshtemoa,	1
30:29	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Rachal,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Jerahmeelites,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Kenites,	1
30:30	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Hormah,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Chorashan,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Athach,	1
30:31	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
where	1
David	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
haunt.	1
	1
31:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
slain	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
followed	1
hard	1
upon	1
Saul	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
sons;	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
slew	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
Melchishua,	1
Saul's	1
sons.	1
	1
31:3	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
went	1
sore	1
against	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
archers	1
hit	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
wounded	1
of	1
the	1
archers.	1
	1
31:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
unto	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
Draw	1
thy	1
sword,	1
and	1
thrust	1
me	1
through	1
therewith;	1
lest	1
these	1
uncircumcised	1
come	1
and	1
thrust	1
me	1
through,	1
and	1
abuse	1
me.	1
But	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
would	1
not;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
Therefore	1
Saul	1
took	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
31:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
fell	1
likewise	1
upon	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
died	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
31:6	1
So	1
Saul	1
died,	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons,	1
and	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
together.	1
	1
31:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
Jordan,	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled,	1
and	1
that	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
dead,	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
fled;	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
to	1
strip	1
the	1
slain,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
fallen	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
31:9	1
And	1
they	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
stripped	1
off	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
round	1
about,	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
idols,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ashtaroth:	1
and	1
they	1
fastened	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Bethshan.	1
	1
31:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Saul;	1
31:12	1
All	1
the	1
valiant	1
men	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
from	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Bethshan,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
burnt	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
31:13	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
buried	1
them	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
at	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
fasted	1
seven	1
days.	1

The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
Samuel	1
	1
Otherwise	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Saul,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites,	1
and	1
David	1
had	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
Ziklag;	1
1:2	1
It	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
from	1
Saul	1
with	1
his	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
From	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel	1
am	1
I	1
escaped.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
went	1
the	1
matter?	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
tell	1
me.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
That	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
are	1
fallen	1
and	1
dead;	1
and	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
are	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
How	1
knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
be	1
dead?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
happened	1
by	1
chance	1
upon	1
mount	1
Gilboa,	1
behold,	1
Saul	1
leaned	1
upon	1
his	1
spear;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen	1
followed	1
hard	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
he	1
saw	1
me,	1
and	1
called	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Here	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Amalekite.	1
	1
1:9	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
Stand,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
slay	1
me:	1
for	1
anguish	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
yet	1
whole	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
1:10	1
So	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fallen:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
crown	1
that	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
bracelet	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
them	1
hither	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
David	1
took	1
hold	1
on	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
rent	1
them;	1
and	1
likewise	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
1:12	1
And	1
they	1
mourned,	1
and	1
wept,	1
and	1
fasted	1
until	1
even,	1
for	1
Saul,	1
and	1
for	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
stranger,	1
an	1
Amalekite.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
wast	1
thou	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed?	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
David	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
thy	1
head;	1
for	1
thy	1
mouth	1
hath	1
testified	1
against	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
David	1
lamented	1
with	1
this	1
lamentation	1
over	1
Saul	1
and	1
over	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son:	1
1:18	1
(Also	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
teach	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
bow:	1
behold,	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jasher.)	1
1:19	1
The	1
beauty	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
slain	1
upon	1
thy	1
high	1
places:	1
how	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen!	1
	1
1:20	1
Tell	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
Gath,	1
publish	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Askelon;	1
lest	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
rejoice,	1
lest	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcised	1
triumph.	1
	1
1:21	1
Ye	1
mountains	1
of	1
Gilboa,	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
dew,	1
neither	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
rain,	1
upon	1
you,	1
nor	1
fields	1
of	1
offerings:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
is	1
vilely	1
cast	1
away,	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
Saul,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil.	1
	1
1:22	1
From	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
slain,	1
from	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
mighty,	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
turned	1
not	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Saul	1
returned	1
not	1
empty.	1
	1
1:23	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
were	1
lovely	1
and	1
pleasant	1
in	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
death	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
divided:	1
they	1
were	1
swifter	1
than	1
eagles,	1
they	1
were	1
stronger	1
than	1
lions.	1
	1
1:24	1
Ye	1
daughters	1
of	1
Israel,	1
weep	1
over	1
Saul,	1
who	1
clothed	1
you	1
in	1
scarlet,	1
with	1
other	1
delights,	1
who	1
put	1
on	1
ornaments	1
of	1
gold	1
upon	1
your	1
apparel.	1
	1
1:25	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
battle!	1
O	1
Jonathan,	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain	1
in	1
thine	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
1:26	1
I	1
am	1
distressed	1
for	1
thee,	1
my	1
brother	1
Jonathan:	1
very	1
pleasant	1
hast	1
thou	1
been	1
unto	1
me:	1
thy	1
love	1
to	1
me	1
was	1
wonderful,	1
passing	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
women.	1
	1
1:27	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
mighty	1
fallen,	1
and	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
war	1
perished!	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
up.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Whither	1
shall	1
I	1
go	1
up?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Unto	1
Hebron.	1
	1
2:2	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
thither,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
wives	1
also,	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess,	1
and	1
Abigail	1
Nabal's	1
wife	1
the	1
Carmelite.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
did	1
David	1
bring	1
up,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
household:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Hebron.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
came,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
That	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead	1
were	1
they	1
that	1
buried	1
Saul.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
this	1
kindness	1
unto	1
your	1
lord,	1
even	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
and	1
have	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
shew	1
kindness	1
and	1
truth	1
unto	1
you:	1
and	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
requite	1
you	1
this	1
kindness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
2:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strengthened,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
valiant:	1
for	1
your	1
master	1
Saul	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
have	1
anointed	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
captain	1
of	1
Saul's	1
host,	1
took	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
over	1
to	1
Mahanaim;	1
2:9	1
And	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
Ashurites,	1
and	1
over	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
over	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
over	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ishbosheth	1
Saul's	1
son	1
was	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
reigned	1
two	1
years.	1
But	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
followed	1
David.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
king	1
in	1
Hebron	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
was	1
seven	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
Mahanaim	1
to	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David,	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
met	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Gibeon:	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
down,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
to	1
Joab,	1
Let	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
now	1
arise,	1
and	1
play	1
before	1
us.	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
arise.	1
	1
2:15	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
by	1
number	1
twelve	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
which	1
pertained	1
to	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
twelve	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
fellow	1
by	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
thrust	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
fellow's	1
side;	1
so	1
they	1
fell	1
down	1
together:	1
wherefore	1
that	1
place	1
was	1
called	1
Helkathhazzurim,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
sore	1
battle	1
that	1
day;	1
and	1
Abner	1
was	1
beaten,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
there,	1
Joab,	1
and	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
Asahel:	1
and	1
Asahel	1
was	1
as	1
light	1
of	1
foot	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
roe.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
Asahel	1
pursued	1
after	1
Abner;	1
and	1
in	1
going	1
he	1
turned	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
following	1
Abner.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
Abner	1
looked	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
Asahel?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Turn	1
thee	1
aside	1
to	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
thy	1
left,	1
and	1
lay	1
thee	1
hold	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
take	1
thee	1
his	1
armour.	1
	1
But	1
Asahel	1
would	1
not	1
turn	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
Asahel,	1
Turn	1
thee	1
aside	1
from	1
following	1
me:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
I	1
smite	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
how	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
hold	1
up	1
my	1
face	1
to	1
Joab	1
thy	1
brother?	1
	1
2:23	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
turn	1
aside:	1
wherefore	1
Abner	1
with	1
the	1
hinder	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
spear	1
smote	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib,	1
that	1
the	1
spear	1
came	1
out	1
behind	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
there,	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Asahel	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
died	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
2:24	1
Joab	1
also	1
and	1
Abishai	1
pursued	1
after	1
Abner:	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
of	1
Ammah,	1
that	1
lieth	1
before	1
Giah	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
after	1
Abner,	1
and	1
became	1
one	1
troop,	1
and	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill.	1
	1
2:26	1
Then	1
Abner	1
called	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Shall	1
the	1
sword	1
devour	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
bitterness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
end?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
then,	1
ere	1
thou	1
bid	1
the	1
people	1
return	1
from	1
following	1
their	1
brethren?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
As	1
God	1
liveth,	1
unless	1
thou	1
hadst	1
spoken,	1
surely	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
following	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
2:28	1
So	1
Joab	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
pursued	1
after	1
Israel	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
fought	1
they	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
2:29	1
And	1
Abner	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
walked	1
all	1
that	1
night	1
through	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
all	1
Bithron,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Mahanaim.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
Joab	1
returned	1
from	1
following	1
Abner:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
there	1
lacked	1
of	1
David's	1
servants	1
nineteen	1
men	1
and	1
Asahel.	1
	1
2:31	1
But	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
had	1
smitten	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
of	1
Abner's	1
men,	1
so	1
that	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
men	1
died.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
Asahel,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Bethlehem.	1
And	1
Joab	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
all	1
night,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Hebron	1
at	1
break	1
of	1
day.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
long	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David:	1
but	1
David	1
waxed	1
stronger	1
and	1
stronger,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
waxed	1
weaker	1
and	1
weaker.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
unto	1
David	1
were	1
sons	1
born	1
in	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
his	1
firstborn	1
was	1
Amnon,	1
of	1
Ahinoam	1
the	1
Jezreelitess;	1
3:3	1
And	1
his	1
second,	1
Chileab,	1
of	1
Abigail	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Nabal	1
the	1
Carmelite;	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
Absalom	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maacah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Talmai	1
king	1
of	1
Geshur;	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
fourth,	1
Adonijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haggith;	1
and	1
the	1
fifth,	1
Shephatiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abital;	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
sixth,	1
Ithream,	1
by	1
Eglah	1
David's	1
wife.	1
These	1
were	1
born	1
to	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
Abner	1
made	1
himself	1
strong	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
Saul	1
had	1
a	1
concubine,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Rizpah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aiah:	1
and	1
Ishbosheth	1
said	1
to	1
Abner,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
gone	1
in	1
unto	1
my	1
father's	1
concubine?	1
	1
3:8	1
Then	1
was	1
Abner	1
very	1
wroth	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
dog's	1
head,	1
which	1
against	1
Judah	1
do	1
shew	1
kindness	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
thy	1
father,	1
to	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
delivered	1
thee	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
thou	1
chargest	1
me	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
fault	1
concerning	1
this	1
woman?	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
do	1
God	1
to	1
Abner,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
except,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
to	1
David,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
him;	1
3:10	1
To	1
translate	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David	1
over	1
Israel	1
and	1
over	1
Judah,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
Abner	1
a	1
word	1
again,	1
because	1
he	1
feared	1
him.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
Abner	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David	1
on	1
his	1
behalf,	1
saying,	1
Whose	1
is	1
the	1
land?	1
saying	1
also,	1
Make	1
thy	1
league	1
with	1
me,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
my	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
all	1
Israel	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Well;	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
thee:	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
is,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face,	1
except	1
thou	1
first	1
bring	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Ishbosheth	1
Saul's	1
son,	1
saying,	1
Deliver	1
me	1
my	1
wife	1
Michal,	1
which	1
I	1
espoused	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
foreskins	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Ishbosheth	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
husband,	1
even	1
from	1
Phaltiel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Laish.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
her	1
husband	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
along	1
weeping	1
behind	1
her	1
to	1
Bahurim.	1
	1
Then	1
said	1
Abner	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
return.	1
And	1
he	1
returned.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
Abner	1
had	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
sought	1
for	1
David	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
you:	1
3:18	1
Now	1
then	1
do	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
of	1
David,	1
saying,	1
By	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
servant	1
David	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
Abner	1
also	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
and	1
Abner	1
went	1
also	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron	1
all	1
that	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
3:20	1
So	1
Abner	1
came	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
twenty	1
men	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
David	1
made	1
Abner	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
feast.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
Abner	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
Israel	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
make	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
reign	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
thine	1
heart	1
desireth.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
Abner	1
away;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
Joab	1
came	1
from	1
pursuing	1
a	1
troop,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
spoil	1
with	1
them:	1
but	1
Abner	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
David	1
in	1
Hebron;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:23	1
When	1
Joab	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
come,	1
they	1
told	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
Joab	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
behold,	1
Abner	1
came	1
unto	1
thee;	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
gone?	1
	1
3:25	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
deceive	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
thy	1
going	1
out	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
when	1
Joab	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
David,	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
after	1
Abner,	1
which	1
brought	1
him	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Sirah:	1
but	1
David	1
knew	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
when	1
Abner	1
was	1
returned	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
Joab	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him	1
quietly,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib,	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Asahel	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:28	1
And	1
afterward	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
kingdom	1
are	1
guiltless	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner:	1
3:29	1
Let	1
it	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joab,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
his	1
father's	1
house;	1
and	1
let	1
there	1
not	1
fail	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joab	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
issue,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
leper,	1
or	1
that	1
leaneth	1
on	1
a	1
staff,	1
or	1
that	1
falleth	1
on	1
the	1
sword,	1
or	1
that	1
lacketh	1
bread.	1
	1
3:30	1
So	1
Joab,	1
and	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother	1
slew	1
Abner,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
their	1
brother	1
Asahel	1
at	1
Gibeon	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
3:31	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
Rend	1
your	1
clothes,	1
and	1
gird	1
you	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
mourn	1
before	1
Abner.	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
himself	1
followed	1
the	1
bier.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
Abner	1
in	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
wept	1
at	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
Abner;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
wept.	1
	1
3:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
lamented	1
over	1
Abner,	1
and	1
said,	1
Died	1
Abner	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
dieth?	1
	1
3:34	1
Thy	1
hands	1
were	1
not	1
bound,	1
nor	1
thy	1
feet	1
put	1
into	1
fetters:	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
falleth	1
before	1
wicked	1
men,	1
so	1
fellest	1
thou.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
wept	1
again	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
3:35	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
cause	1
David	1
to	1
eat	1
meat	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
day,	1
David	1
sware,	1
saying,	1
So	1
do	1
God	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
I	1
taste	1
bread,	1
or	1
ought	1
else,	1
till	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
down.	1
	1
3:36	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
pleased	1
them:	1
as	1
whatsoever	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
pleased	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:37	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
understood	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
slay	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner.	1
	1
3:38	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
prince	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
fallen	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
Israel?	1
	1
3:39	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
weak,	1
though	1
anointed	1
king;	1
and	1
these	1
men	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
for	1
me:	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reward	1
the	1
doer	1
of	1
evil	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
wickedness.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
when	1
Saul's	1
son	1
heard	1
that	1
Abner	1
was	1
dead	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
feeble,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Israelites	1
were	1
troubled.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
Saul's	1
son	1
had	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
captains	1
of	1
bands:	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
was	1
Baanah,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
Rechab,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
a	1
Beerothite,	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin:	1
(for	1
Beeroth	1
also	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
Beerothites	1
fled	1
to	1
Gittaim,	1
and	1
were	1
sojourners	1
there	1
until	1
this	1
day.)	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Jonathan,	1
Saul's	1
son,	1
had	1
a	1
son	1
that	1
was	1
lame	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
He	1
was	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
the	1
tidings	1
came	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
out	1
of	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
his	1
nurse	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
fled:	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
she	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
flee,	1
that	1
he	1
fell,	1
and	1
became	1
lame.	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Mephibosheth.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
the	1
Beerothite,	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah,	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
about	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
who	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
at	1
noon.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
fetched	1
wheat;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib:	1
and	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah	1
his	1
brother	1
escaped.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
his	1
bedchamber,	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
beheaded	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gat	1
them	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
plain	1
all	1
night.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
unto	1
David	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
thine	1
enemy,	1
which	1
sought	1
thy	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
seed.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
David	1
answered	1
Rechab	1
and	1
Baanah	1
his	1
brother,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
the	1
Beerothite,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
who	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
my	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
adversity,	1
4:10	1
When	1
one	1
told	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Saul	1
is	1
dead,	1
thinking	1
to	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
tidings,	1
I	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
in	1
Ziklag,	1
who	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
reward	1
for	1
his	1
tidings:	1
4:11	1
How	1
much	1
more,	1
when	1
wicked	1
men	1
have	1
slain	1
a	1
righteous	1
person	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
upon	1
his	1
bed?	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
therefore	1
now	1
require	1
his	1
blood	1
of	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
David	1
commanded	1
his	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
their	1
hands	1
and	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
hanged	1
them	1
up	1
over	1
the	1
pool	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
But	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Ishbosheth,	1
and	1
buried	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Abner	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
came	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
David	1
unto	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
are	1
thy	1
bone	1
and	1
thy	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:2	1
Also	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
us,	1
thou	1
wast	1
he	1
that	1
leddest	1
out	1
and	1
broughtest	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
feed	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
captain	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:3	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Hebron;	1
and	1
king	1
David	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
Hebron	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
David	1
was	1
thirty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
5:5	1
In	1
Hebron	1
he	1
reigned	1
over	1
Judah	1
seven	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months:	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
he	1
reigned	1
thirty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
over	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Except	1
thou	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
hither:	1
thinking,	1
David	1
cannot	1
come	1
in	1
hither.	1
	1
5:7	1
Nevertheless	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
Zion:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
day,	1
Whosoever	1
getteth	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
gutter,	1
and	1
smiteth	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
that	1
are	1
hated	1
of	1
David's	1
soul,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
chief	1
and	1
captain.	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:9	1
So	1
David	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
fort,	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
David	1
built	1
round	1
about	1
from	1
Millo	1
and	1
inward.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
grew	1
great,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
Hiram	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
cedar	1
trees,	1
and	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
masons:	1
and	1
they	1
built	1
David	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
David	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
established	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
exalted	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
his	1
people	1
Israel's	1
sake.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
him	1
more	1
concubines	1
and	1
wives	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
Hebron:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
yet	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters	1
born	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
Shammuah,	1
and	1
Shobab,	1
and	1
Nathan,	1
and	1
Solomon,	1
5:15	1
Ibhar	1
also,	1
and	1
Elishua,	1
and	1
Nepheg,	1
and	1
Japhia,	1
5:16	1
And	1
Elishama,	1
and	1
Eliada,	1
and	1
Eliphalet.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
all	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
seek	1
David;	1
and	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
hold.	1
	1
5:18	1
The	1
Philistines	1
also	1
came	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
mine	1
hand?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Go	1
up:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
doubtless	1
deliver	1
the	1
Philistines	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Baalperazim,	1
and	1
David	1
smote	1
them	1
there,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
broken	1
forth	1
upon	1
mine	1
enemies	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
breach	1
of	1
waters.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Baalperazim.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
left	1
their	1
images,	1
and	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
burned	1
them.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
up	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
up;	1
but	1
fetch	1
a	1
compass	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
let	1
it	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
hearest	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees,	1
that	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bestir	1
thyself:	1
for	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
out	1
before	1
thee,	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
David	1
did	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
him;	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Geba	1
until	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
Gazer.	1
	1
6:1	1
Again,	1
David	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thirty	1
thousand.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Baale	1
of	1
Judah,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
a	1
new	1
cart,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Gibeah:	1
and	1
Uzzah	1
and	1
Ahio,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Abinadab,	1
drave	1
the	1
new	1
cart.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Gibeah,	1
accompanying	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
Ahio	1
went	1
before	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
played	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
instruments	1
made	1
of	1
fir	1
wood,	1
even	1
on	1
harps,	1
and	1
on	1
psalteries,	1
and	1
on	1
timbrels,	1
and	1
on	1
cornets,	1
and	1
on	1
cymbals.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Nachon's	1
threshingfloor,	1
Uzzah	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
the	1
oxen	1
shook	1
it.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Uzzah;	1
and	1
God	1
smote	1
him	1
there	1
for	1
his	1
error;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
died	1
by	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
displeased,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
upon	1
Uzzah:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
Perezuzzah	1
to	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
shall	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
6:10	1
So	1
David	1
would	1
not	1
remove	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
but	1
David	1
carried	1
it	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
the	1
Gittite.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
the	1
Gittite	1
three	1
months:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
king	1
David,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
pertaineth	1
unto	1
him,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God.	1
So	1
David	1
went	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
with	1
gladness.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
gone	1
six	1
paces,	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
oxen	1
and	1
fatlings.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
David	1
danced	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might;	1
and	1
David	1
was	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
linen	1
ephod.	1
	1
6:15	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
Michal	1
Saul's	1
daughter	1
looked	1
through	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
saw	1
king	1
David	1
leaping	1
and	1
dancing	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
she	1
despised	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
pitched	1
for	1
it:	1
and	1
David	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
he	1
blessed	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
he	1
dealt	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
as	1
men,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
cake	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
flesh,	1
and	1
a	1
flagon	1
of	1
wine.	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
departed	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
6:20	1
Then	1
David	1
returned	1
to	1
bless	1
his	1
household.	1
And	1
Michal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
glorious	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
day,	1
who	1
uncovered	1
himself	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
handmaids	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
vain	1
fellows	1
shamelessly	1
uncovereth	1
himself!	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Michal,	1
It	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
chose	1
me	1
before	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
to	1
appoint	1
me	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
play	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
more	1
vile	1
than	1
thus,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
base	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
sight:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
maidservants	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
of,	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
honour.	1
	1
6:23	1
Therefore	1
Michal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul	1
had	1
no	1
child	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
her	1
death.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
rest	1
round	1
about	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
enemies;	1
7:2	1
That	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
See	1
now,	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedar,	1
but	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
within	1
curtains.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
Go,	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Nathan,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Shalt	1
thou	1
build	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
dwell	1
in?	1
	1
7:6	1
Whereas	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
dwelt	1
in	1
any	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
have	1
walked	1
in	1
a	1
tent	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
7:7	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
places	1
wherein	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
spake	1
I	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
I	1
commanded	1
to	1
feed	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
build	1
ye	1
not	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedar?	1
	1
7:8	1
Now	1
therefore	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
took	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
sheepcote,	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
sheep,	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
over	1
my	1
people,	1
over	1
Israel:	1
7:9	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
wentest,	1
and	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
great	1
name,	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:10	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
appoint	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
plant	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
move	1
no	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wickedness	1
afflict	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
as	1
beforetime,	1
7:11	1
And	1
as	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
judges	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
have	1
caused	1
thee	1
to	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
Also	1
the	1
LORD	1
telleth	1
thee	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
when	1
thy	1
days	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
sleep	1
with	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee,	1
which	1
shall	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:13	1
He	1
shall	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stablish	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
7:14	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
If	1
he	1
commit	1
iniquity,	1
I	1
will	1
chasten	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
rod	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
stripes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men:	1
7:15	1
But	1
my	1
mercy	1
shall	1
not	1
depart	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
Saul,	1
whom	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
thine	1
house	1
and	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
thee:	1
thy	1
throne	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
7:17	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
vision,	1
so	1
did	1
Nathan	1
speak	1
unto	1
David.	1
	1
7:18	1
Then	1
went	1
king	1
David	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
am	1
I,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD?	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
house,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
hitherto?	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
also	1
of	1
thy	1
servant's	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
to	1
come.	1
And	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
man,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD?	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
what	1
can	1
David	1
say	1
more	1
unto	1
thee?	1
for	1
thou,	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
knowest	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
7:21	1
For	1
thy	1
word's	1
sake,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
heart,	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
great	1
things,	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
servant	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
7:22	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
great,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
thee,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
God	1
beside	1
thee,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
our	1
ears.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
what	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
like	1
thy	1
people,	1
even	1
like	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
God	1
went	1
to	1
redeem	1
for	1
a	1
people	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
name,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
terrible,	1
for	1
thy	1
land,	1
before	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
thou	1
redeemedst	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
their	1
gods?	1
	1
7:24	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
confirmed	1
to	1
thyself	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
people	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
art	1
become	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
concerning	1
his	1
house,	1
establish	1
it	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
let	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
magnified	1
for	1
ever,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
over	1
Israel:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:27	1
For	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hast	1
revealed	1
to	1
thy	1
servant,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
thee	1
an	1
house:	1
therefore	1
hath	1
thy	1
servant	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
pray	1
this	1
prayer	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
God,	1
and	1
thy	1
words	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
this	1
goodness	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant:	1
7:29	1
Therefore	1
now	1
let	1
it	1
please	1
thee	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
continue	1
for	1
ever	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
hast	1
spoken	1
it:	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
blessing	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
be	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
David	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
subdued	1
them:	1
and	1
David	1
took	1
Methegammah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
Moab,	1
and	1
measured	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
line,	1
casting	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
even	1
with	1
two	1
lines	1
measured	1
he	1
to	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
full	1
line	1
to	1
keep	1
alive.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
Moabites	1
became	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
	1
8:3	1
David	1
smote	1
also	1
Hadadezer,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
border	1
at	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
footmen:	1
and	1
David	1
houghed	1
all	1
the	1
chariot	1
horses,	1
but	1
reserved	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
chariots.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Damascus	1
came	1
to	1
succour	1
Hadadezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
David	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
8:6	1
Then	1
David	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Syria	1
of	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
became	1
servants	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
from	1
Betah,	1
and	1
from	1
Berothai,	1
cities	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
king	1
David	1
took	1
exceeding	1
much	1
brass.	1
	1
8:9	1
When	1
Toi	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath	1
heard	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
smitten	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
8:10	1
Then	1
Toi	1
sent	1
Joram	1
his	1
son	1
unto	1
king	1
David,	1
to	1
salute	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
Hadadezer,	1
and	1
smitten	1
him:	1
for	1
Hadadezer	1
had	1
wars	1
with	1
Toi.	1
And	1
Joram	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass:	1
8:11	1
Which	1
also	1
king	1
David	1
did	1
dedicate	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dedicated	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
which	1
he	1
subdued;	1
8:12	1
Of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
of	1
Amalek,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
Hadadezer,	1
son	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
David	1
gat	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
smiting	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
salt,	1
being	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Edom;	1
throughout	1
all	1
Edom	1
put	1
he	1
garrisons,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
Edom	1
became	1
David's	1
servants.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
David	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
executed	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
host;	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud	1
was	1
recorder;	1
8:17	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar,	1
were	1
the	1
priests;	1
and	1
Seraiah	1
was	1
the	1
scribe;	1
8:18	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
was	1
over	1
both	1
the	1
Cherethites	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites;	1
and	1
David's	1
sons	1
were	1
chief	1
rulers.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
him	1
kindness	1
for	1
Jonathan's	1
sake?	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul	1
a	1
servant	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Ziba.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
unto	1
David,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
Ziba?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
is	1
he.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
yet	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
shew	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Jonathan	1
hath	1
yet	1
a	1
son,	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel,	1
in	1
Lodebar.	1
	1
9:5	1
Then	1
king	1
David	1
sent,	1
and	1
fetched	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Machir,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel,	1
from	1
Lodebar.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
Mephibosheth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jonathan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
David,	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
did	1
reverence.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Mephibosheth.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
servant!	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
shew	1
thee	1
kindness	1
for	1
Jonathan	1
thy	1
father's	1
sake,	1
and	1
will	1
restore	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Saul	1
thy	1
father;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
bread	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
continually.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
look	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
dead	1
dog	1
as	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
9:9	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
called	1
to	1
Ziba,	1
Saul's	1
servant,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
to	1
Saul	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
9:10	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
thy	1
servants,	1
shall	1
till	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
fruits,	1
that	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
may	1
have	1
food	1
to	1
eat:	1
but	1
Mephibosheth	1
thy	1
master's	1
son	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
alway	1
at	1
my	1
table.	1
Now	1
Ziba	1
had	1
fifteen	1
sons	1
and	1
twenty	1
servants.	1
	1
9:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Ziba	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
commanded	1
his	1
servant,	1
so	1
shall	1
thy	1
servant	1
do.	1
As	1
for	1
Mephibosheth,	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
at	1
my	1
table,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
sons.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
had	1
a	1
young	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Micha.	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ziba	1
were	1
servants	1
unto	1
Mephibosheth.	1
	1
9:13	1
So	1
Mephibosheth	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
continually	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
table;	1
and	1
was	1
lame	1
on	1
both	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
died,	1
and	1
Hanun	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
10:2	1
Then	1
said	1
David,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
Hanun	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahash,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
for	1
his	1
father.	1
And	1
David's	1
servants	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
said	1
unto	1
Hanun	1
their	1
lord,	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
David	1
doth	1
honour	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
comforters	1
unto	1
thee?	1
hath	1
not	1
David	1
rather	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
unto	1
thee,	1
to	1
search	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
to	1
spy	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
overthrow	1
it?	1
10:4	1
Wherefore	1
Hanun	1
took	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
shaved	1
off	1
the	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
their	1
beards,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
even	1
to	1
their	1
buttocks,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
10:5	1
When	1
they	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
David,	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
greatly	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Tarry	1
at	1
Jericho	1
until	1
your	1
beards	1
be	1
grown,	1
and	1
then	1
return.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
stank	1
before	1
David,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
sent	1
and	1
hired	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Bethrehob	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Zoba,	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
footmen,	1
and	1
of	1
king	1
Maacah	1
a	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
Ishtob	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
sent	1
Joab,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Zoba,	1
and	1
of	1
Rehob,	1
and	1
Ishtob,	1
and	1
Maacah,	1
were	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:9	1
When	1
Joab	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
against	1
him	1
before	1
and	1
behind,	1
he	1
chose	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
choice	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
the	1
Syrians	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
help	1
me:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
thee,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
thee.	1
	1
10:12	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
play	1
the	1
men	1
for	1
our	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
seemeth	1
him	1
good.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
Joab	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
unto	1
the	1
battle	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Syrians	1
were	1
fled,	1
then	1
fled	1
they	1
also	1
before	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
So	1
Joab	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
Hadarezer	1
sent,	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
Syrians	1
that	1
were	1
beyond	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Helam;	1
and	1
Shobach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadarezer	1
went	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
David,	1
he	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Helam.	1
And	1
the	1
Syrians	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
David,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
the	1
Syrians	1
fled	1
before	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
slew	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
seven	1
hundred	1
chariots	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
smote	1
Shobach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
host,	1
who	1
died	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
servants	1
to	1
Hadarezer	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
smitten	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
Israel,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
So	1
the	1
Syrians	1
feared	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
the	1
year	1
was	1
expired,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
kings	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
battle,	1
that	1
David	1
sent	1
Joab,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
destroyed	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
besieged	1
Rabbah.	1
But	1
David	1
tarried	1
still	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
an	1
eveningtide,	1
that	1
David	1
arose	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
walked	1
upon	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
roof	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
washing	1
herself;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
very	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
upon.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
enquired	1
after	1
the	1
woman.	1
And	1
one	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Bathsheba,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Eliam,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite?	1
11:4	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers,	1
and	1
took	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
her;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
purified	1
from	1
her	1
uncleanness:	1
and	1
she	1
returned	1
unto	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
conceived,	1
and	1
sent	1
and	1
told	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
Joab,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
me	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite.	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
Uriah	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
Uriah	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
David	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
how	1
Joab	1
did,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
people	1
did,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
war	1
prospered.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Uriah,	1
Go	1
down	1
to	1
thy	1
house,	1
and	1
wash	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
Uriah	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
meat	1
from	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
Uriah	1
slept	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
his	1
lord,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Uriah	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Uriah,	1
Camest	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
thy	1
journey?	1
why	1
then	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
unto	1
thine	1
house?	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Uriah	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
The	1
ark,	1
and	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Judah,	1
abide	1
in	1
tents;	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
Joab,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
are	1
encamped	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
fields;	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
go	1
into	1
mine	1
house,	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
lie	1
with	1
my	1
wife?	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Uriah,	1
Tarry	1
here	1
to	1
day	1
also,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
depart.	1
So	1
Uriah	1
abode	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
morrow.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
drunk:	1
and	1
at	1
even	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
lie	1
on	1
his	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
his	1
lord,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
David	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Joab,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Uriah.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
letter,	1
saying,	1
Set	1
ye	1
Uriah	1
in	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
hottest	1
battle,	1
and	1
retire	1
ye	1
from	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
smitten,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joab	1
observed	1
the	1
city,	1
that	1
he	1
assigned	1
Uriah	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
valiant	1
men	1
were.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
Joab:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
11:18	1
Then	1
Joab	1
sent	1
and	1
told	1
David	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
war;	1
11:19	1
And	1
charged	1
the	1
messenger,	1
saying,	1
When	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
telling	1
the	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
11:20	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
wrath	1
arise,	1
and	1
he	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Wherefore	1
approached	1
ye	1
so	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
fight?	1
knew	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
shoot	1
from	1
the	1
wall?	1
	1
11:21	1
Who	1
smote	1
Abimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jerubbesheth?	1
did	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
cast	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
upon	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
Thebez?	1
why	1
went	1
ye	1
nigh	1
the	1
wall?	1
then	1
say	1
thou,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
So	1
the	1
messenger	1
went,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
shewed	1
David	1
all	1
that	1
Joab	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
for.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Surely	1
the	1
men	1
prevailed	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
unto	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
upon	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
11:24	1
And	1
the	1
shooters	1
shot	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
wall	1
upon	1
thy	1
servants;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
be	1
dead,	1
and	1
thy	1
servant	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
messenger,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Let	1
not	1
this	1
thing	1
displease	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
devoureth	1
one	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
another:	1
make	1
thy	1
battle	1
more	1
strong	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
overthrow	1
it:	1
and	1
encourage	1
thou	1
him.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
heard	1
that	1
Uriah	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
dead,	1
she	1
mourned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
mourning	1
was	1
past,	1
David	1
sent	1
and	1
fetched	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son.	1
But	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
done	1
displeased	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
Nathan	1
unto	1
David.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
city;	1
the	1
one	1
rich,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
poor.	1
	1
12:2	1
The	1
rich	1
man	1
had	1
exceeding	1
many	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds:	1
12:3	1
But	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
had	1
nothing,	1
save	1
one	1
little	1
ewe	1
lamb,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
and	1
nourished	1
up:	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
children;	1
it	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
meat,	1
and	1
drank	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
cup,	1
and	1
lay	1
in	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
was	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
daughter.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
traveller	1
unto	1
the	1
rich	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
spared	1
to	1
take	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
flock	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
herd,	1
to	1
dress	1
for	1
the	1
wayfaring	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
him;	1
but	1
took	1
the	1
poor	1
man's	1
lamb,	1
and	1
dressed	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
David's	1
anger	1
was	1
greatly	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Nathan,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
thing	1
shall	1
surely	1
die:	1
12:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
restore	1
the	1
lamb	1
fourfold,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
pity.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
man.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
I	1
delivered	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul;	1
12:8	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
thy	1
master's	1
house,	1
and	1
thy	1
master's	1
wives	1
into	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
and	1
gave	1
thee	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
little,	1
I	1
would	1
moreover	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
thee	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
12:9	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
despised	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
his	1
sight?	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
hast	1
taken	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
wife,	1
and	1
hast	1
slain	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
12:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
never	1
depart	1
from	1
thine	1
house;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
despised	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
taken	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
wife.	1
	1
12:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
evil	1
against	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
thy	1
wives	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
unto	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lie	1
with	1
thy	1
wives	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
sun.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
thou	1
didst	1
it	1
secretly:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
before	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Nathan,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
hath	1
put	1
away	1
thy	1
sin;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
12:14	1
Howbeit,	1
because	1
by	1
this	1
deed	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
great	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
blaspheme,	1
the	1
child	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
Nathan	1
departed	1
unto	1
his	1
house.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
struck	1
the	1
child	1
that	1
Uriah's	1
wife	1
bare	1
unto	1
David,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
sick.	1
	1
12:16	1
David	1
therefore	1
besought	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
David	1
fasted,	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
lay	1
all	1
night	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
he	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
died.	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
feared	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
while	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
we	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
our	1
voice:	1
how	1
will	1
he	1
then	1
vex	1
himself,	1
if	1
we	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
dead?	1
	1
12:19	1
But	1
when	1
David	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
servants	1
whispered,	1
David	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead:	1
therefore	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Is	1
the	1
child	1
dead?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
12:20	1
Then	1
David	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
anointed	1
himself,	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
apparel,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
worshipped:	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
required,	1
they	1
set	1
bread	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat.	1
	1
12:21	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
servants	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
thing	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done?	1
thou	1
didst	1
fast	1
and	1
weep	1
for	1
the	1
child,	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
alive;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead,	1
thou	1
didst	1
rise	1
and	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
While	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
I	1
fasted	1
and	1
wept:	1
for	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
whether	1
GOD	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
may	1
live?	1
	1
12:23	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
dead,	1
wherefore	1
should	1
I	1
fast?	1
can	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
again?	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
David	1
comforted	1
Bathsheba	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
bare	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Solomon:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
loved	1
him.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
Jedidiah,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
Joab	1
fought	1
against	1
Rabbah	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
royal	1
city.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
12:28	1
Now	1
therefore	1
gather	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
encamp	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
take	1
it:	1
lest	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
David	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
their	1
king's	1
crown	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
the	1
weight	1
whereof	1
was	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
stones:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
David's	1
head.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
under	1
saws,	1
and	1
under	1
harrows	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
under	1
axes	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
brick-kiln:	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
he	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
So	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
had	1
a	1
fair	1
sister,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar;	1
and	1
Amnon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
loved	1
her.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Amnon	1
was	1
so	1
vexed,	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
sick	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
virgin;	1
and	1
Amnon	1
thought	1
it	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
13:3	1
But	1
Amnon	1
had	1
a	1
friend,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Jonadab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeah	1
David's	1
brother:	1
and	1
Jonadab	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
subtil	1
man.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
art	1
thou,	1
being	1
the	1
king's	1
son,	1
lean	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day?	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
tell	1
me?	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
love	1
Tamar,	1
my	1
brother	1
Absalom's	1
sister.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Jonadab	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lay	1
thee	1
down	1
on	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
make	1
thyself	1
sick:	1
and	1
when	1
thy	1
father	1
cometh	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
sister	1
Tamar	1
come,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
meat,	1
and	1
dress	1
the	1
meat	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
Amnon	1
lay	1
down,	1
and	1
made	1
himself	1
sick:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
Tamar	1
my	1
sister	1
come,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
cakes	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
David	1
sent	1
home	1
to	1
Tamar,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
now	1
to	1
thy	1
brother	1
Amnon's	1
house,	1
and	1
dress	1
him	1
meat.	1
	1
13:8	1
So	1
Tamar	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
brother	1
Amnon's	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
laid	1
down.	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
flour,	1
and	1
kneaded	1
it,	1
and	1
made	1
cakes	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
did	1
bake	1
the	1
cakes.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
pan,	1
and	1
poured	1
them	1
out	1
before	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said,	1
Have	1
out	1
all	1
men	1
from	1
me.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
Tamar,	1
Bring	1
the	1
meat	1
into	1
the	1
chamber,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
eat	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
Tamar	1
took	1
the	1
cakes	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
to	1
Amnon	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
eat,	1
he	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Come	1
lie	1
with	1
me,	1
my	1
sister.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
him,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
brother,	1
do	1
not	1
force	1
me;	1
for	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
Israel:	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
this	1
folly.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
I,	1
whither	1
shall	1
I	1
cause	1
my	1
shame	1
to	1
go?	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fools	1
in	1
Israel.	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
withhold	1
me	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
13:14	1
Howbeit	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her	1
voice:	1
but,	1
being	1
stronger	1
than	1
she,	1
forced	1
her,	1
and	1
lay	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
13:15	1
Then	1
Amnon	1
hated	1
her	1
exceedingly;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
hatred	1
wherewith	1
he	1
hated	1
her	1
was	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
had	1
loved	1
her.	1
And	1
Amnon	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Arise,	1
be	1
gone.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
cause:	1
this	1
evil	1
in	1
sending	1
me	1
away	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
unto	1
me.	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
13:17	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
servant	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Put	1
now	1
this	1
woman	1
out	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
bolt	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
upon	1
her:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
robes	1
were	1
the	1
king's	1
daughters	1
that	1
were	1
virgins	1
apparelled.	1
Then	1
his	1
servant	1
brought	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
bolted	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Tamar	1
put	1
ashes	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
rent	1
her	1
garment	1
of	1
divers	1
colours	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
crying.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
Absalom	1
her	1
brother	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Hath	1
Amnon	1
thy	1
brother	1
been	1
with	1
thee?	1
but	1
hold	1
now	1
thy	1
peace,	1
my	1
sister:	1
he	1
is	1
thy	1
brother;	1
regard	1
not	1
this	1
thing.	1
So	1
Tamar	1
remained	1
desolate	1
in	1
her	1
brother	1
Absalom's	1
house.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
when	1
king	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
wroth.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
Absalom	1
spake	1
unto	1
his	1
brother	1
Amnon	1
neither	1
good	1
nor	1
bad:	1
for	1
Absalom	1
hated	1
Amnon,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
forced	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
two	1
full	1
years,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
had	1
sheepshearers	1
in	1
Baalhazor,	1
which	1
is	1
beside	1
Ephraim:	1
and	1
Absalom	1
invited	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
Absalom	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
sheepshearers;	1
let	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
go	1
with	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Absalom,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
son,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
all	1
now	1
go,	1
lest	1
we	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
pressed	1
him:	1
howbeit	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go,	1
but	1
blessed	1
him.	1
	1
13:26	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom,	1
If	1
not,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
brother	1
Amnon	1
go	1
with	1
us.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
go	1
with	1
thee?	1
13:27	1
But	1
Absalom	1
pressed	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
let	1
Amnon	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
go	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
Absalom	1
had	1
commanded	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Mark	1
ye	1
now	1
when	1
Amnon's	1
heart	1
is	1
merry	1
with	1
wine,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Smite	1
Amnon;	1
then	1
kill	1
him,	1
fear	1
not:	1
have	1
not	1
I	1
commanded	1
you?	1
be	1
courageous,	1
and	1
be	1
valiant.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Absalom	1
did	1
unto	1
Amnon	1
as	1
Absalom	1
had	1
commanded.	1
	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
arose,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
gat	1
him	1
up	1
upon	1
his	1
mule,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
tidings	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Absalom	1
hath	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
left.	1
	1
13:31	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose,	1
and	1
tare	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
stood	1
by	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
Jonadab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeah	1
David's	1
brother,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
the	1
king's	1
sons;	1
for	1
Amnon	1
only	1
is	1
dead:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
Absalom	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
determined	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
forced	1
his	1
sister	1
Tamar.	1
	1
13:33	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
take	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
are	1
dead:	1
for	1
Amnon	1
only	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
13:34	1
But	1
Absalom	1
fled.	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
watch	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
much	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
side	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
13:35	1
And	1
Jonadab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
come:	1
as	1
thy	1
servant	1
said,	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
13:36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
speaking,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
came,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
and	1
wept:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
wept	1
very	1
sore.	1
	1
13:37	1
But	1
Absalom	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Talmai,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammihud,	1
king	1
of	1
Geshur.	1
And	1
David	1
mourned	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
every	1
day.	1
	1
13:38	1
So	1
Absalom	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Geshur,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
three	1
years.	1
	1
13:39	1
And	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
king	1
David	1
longed	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
Absalom:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
concerning	1
Amnon,	1
seeing	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
14:1	1
Now	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
heart	1
was	1
toward	1
Absalom.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Joab	1
sent	1
to	1
Tekoah,	1
and	1
fetched	1
thence	1
a	1
wise	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
feign	1
thyself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mourner,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
now	1
mourning	1
apparel,	1
and	1
anoint	1
not	1
thyself	1
with	1
oil,	1
but	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
mourned	1
for	1
the	1
dead:	1
14:3	1
And	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
speak	1
on	1
this	1
manner	1
unto	1
him.	1
So	1
Joab	1
put	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
her	1
mouth.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Tekoah	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
she	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance,	1
and	1
said,	1
Help,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
indeed	1
a	1
widow	1
woman,	1
and	1
mine	1
husband	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
thy	1
handmaid	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
strove	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
part	1
them,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
smote	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
14:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
is	1
risen	1
against	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Deliver	1
him	1
that	1
smote	1
his	1
brother,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
kill	1
him,	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
slew;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
heir	1
also:	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
shall	1
quench	1
my	1
coal	1
which	1
is	1
left,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
to	1
my	1
husband	1
neither	1
name	1
nor	1
remainder	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Go	1
to	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
charge	1
concerning	1
thee.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Tekoah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
the	1
iniquity	1
be	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
be	1
guiltless.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Whoever	1
saith	1
ought	1
unto	1
thee,	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
touch	1
thee	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
14:11	1
Then	1
said	1
she,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
remember	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
revengers	1
of	1
blood	1
to	1
destroy	1
any	1
more,	1
lest	1
they	1
destroy	1
my	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
one	1
hair	1
of	1
thy	1
son	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:12	1
Then	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Let	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
speak	1
one	1
word	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God?	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
speak	1
this	1
thing	1
as	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
faulty,	1
in	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
not	1
fetch	1
home	1
again	1
his	1
banished.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
needs	1
die,	1
and	1
are	1
as	1
water	1
spilt	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
gathered	1
up	1
again;	1
neither	1
doth	1
God	1
respect	1
any	1
person:	1
yet	1
doth	1
he	1
devise	1
means,	1
that	1
his	1
banished	1
be	1
not	1
expelled	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
this	1
thing	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
the	1
people	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
afraid:	1
and	1
thy	1
handmaid	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
perform	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
his	1
handmaid.	1
	1
14:16	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
hear,	1
to	1
deliver	1
his	1
handmaid	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
would	1
destroy	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:17	1
Then	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
said,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
now	1
be	1
comfortable:	1
for	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
is	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
discern	1
good	1
and	1
bad:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Hide	1
not	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
ask	1
thee.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
now	1
speak.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Joab	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
this?	1
	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
As	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
none	1
can	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
ought	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
spoken:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
Joab,	1
he	1
bade	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid:	1
14:20	1
To	1
fetch	1
about	1
this	1
form	1
of	1
speech	1
hath	1
thy	1
servant	1
Joab	1
done	1
this	1
thing:	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
is	1
wise,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing:	1
go	1
therefore,	1
bring	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
again.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
Joab	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself,	1
and	1
thanked	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
Joab	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
thy	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
in	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
14:23	1
So	1
Joab	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Geshur,	1
and	1
brought	1
Absalom	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Let	1
him	1
turn	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
see	1
my	1
face.	1
So	1
Absalom	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
king's	1
face.	1
	1
14:25	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
Israel	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
praised	1
as	1
Absalom	1
for	1
his	1
beauty:	1
from	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
blemish	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
polled	1
his	1
head,	1
(for	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
every	1
year's	1
end	1
that	1
he	1
polled	1
it:	1
because	1
the	1
hair	1
was	1
heavy	1
on	1
him,	1
therefore	1
he	1
polled	1
it:)	1
he	1
weighed	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
two	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
after	1
the	1
king's	1
weight.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
unto	1
Absalom	1
there	1
were	1
born	1
three	1
sons,	1
and	1
one	1
daughter,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Tamar:	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
countenance.	1
	1
14:28	1
So	1
Absalom	1
dwelt	1
two	1
full	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
king's	1
face.	1
	1
14:29	1
Therefore	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
for	1
Joab,	1
to	1
have	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
king;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
sent	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
14:30	1
Therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
See,	1
Joab's	1
field	1
is	1
near	1
mine,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
barley	1
there;	1
go	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
on	1
fire.	1
And	1
Absalom's	1
servants	1
set	1
the	1
field	1
on	1
fire.	1
	1
14:31	1
Then	1
Joab	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Absalom	1
unto	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
have	1
thy	1
servants	1
set	1
my	1
field	1
on	1
fire?	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
Absalom	1
answered	1
Joab,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
from	1
Geshur?	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
still:	1
now	1
therefore	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
the	1
king's	1
face;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
14:33	1
So	1
Joab	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
told	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
for	1
Absalom,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
kissed	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
prepared	1
him	1
chariots	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
fifty	1
men	1
to	1
run	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Absalom	1
rose	1
up	1
early,	1
and	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
controversy	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
judgment,	1
then	1
Absalom	1
called	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
what	1
city	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
is	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
Absalom	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
See,	1
thy	1
matters	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
right;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
deputed	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
15:4	1
Absalom	1
said	1
moreover,	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
were	1
made	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
which	1
hath	1
any	1
suit	1
or	1
cause	1
might	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
justice!	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
man	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
obeisance,	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
on	1
this	1
manner	1
did	1
Absalom	1
to	1
all	1
Israel	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
judgment:	1
so	1
Absalom	1
stole	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
forty	1
years,	1
that	1
Absalom	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
and	1
pay	1
my	1
vow,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
vowed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:8	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
vowed	1
a	1
vow	1
while	1
I	1
abode	1
at	1
Geshur	1
in	1
Syria,	1
saying,	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
bring	1
me	1
again	1
indeed	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace.	1
So	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
spies	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
then	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Absalom	1
reigneth	1
in	1
Hebron.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
with	1
Absalom	1
went	1
two	1
hundred	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
were	1
called;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
their	1
simplicity,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
Absalom	1
sent	1
for	1
Ahithophel	1
the	1
Gilonite,	1
David's	1
counsellor,	1
from	1
his	1
city,	1
even	1
from	1
Giloh,	1
while	1
he	1
offered	1
sacrifices.	1
And	1
the	1
conspiracy	1
was	1
strong;	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
increased	1
continually	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger	1
to	1
David,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
after	1
Absalom.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
flee;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
else	1
escape	1
from	1
Absalom:	1
make	1
speed	1
to	1
depart,	1
lest	1
he	1
overtake	1
us	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
smite	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
servants	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
appoint.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
household	1
after	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
left	1
ten	1
women,	1
which	1
were	1
concubines,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
tarried	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
far	1
off.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
passed	1
on	1
beside	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Pelethites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gittites,	1
six	1
hundred	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
after	1
him	1
from	1
Gath,	1
passed	1
on	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
15:19	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite,	1
Wherefore	1
goest	1
thou	1
also	1
with	1
us?	1
return	1
to	1
thy	1
place,	1
and	1
abide	1
with	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
also	1
an	1
exile.	1
	1
15:20	1
Whereas	1
thou	1
camest	1
but	1
yesterday,	1
should	1
I	1
this	1
day	1
make	1
thee	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
us?	1
seeing	1
I	1
go	1
whither	1
I	1
may,	1
return	1
thou,	1
and	1
take	1
back	1
thy	1
brethren:	1
mercy	1
and	1
truth	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
Ittai	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
liveth,	1
surely	1
in	1
what	1
place	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
be,	1
whether	1
in	1
death	1
or	1
life,	1
even	1
there	1
also	1
will	1
thy	1
servant	1
be.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Ittai,	1
Go	1
and	1
pass	1
over.	1
And	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
ones	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
wept	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
passed	1
over:	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
himself	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
passed	1
over,	1
toward	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
lo	1
Zadok	1
also,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
bearing	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
down	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
went	1
up,	1
until	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
done	1
passing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Zadok,	1
Carry	1
back	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
shew	1
me	1
both	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
habitation:	1
15:26	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
thus	1
say,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
delight	1
in	1
thee;	1
behold,	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:27	1
The	1
king	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
a	1
seer?	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
your	1
two	1
sons	1
with	1
you,	1
Ahimaaz	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar.	1
	1
15:28	1
See,	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
until	1
there	1
come	1
word	1
from	1
you	1
to	1
certify	1
me.	1
	1
15:29	1
Zadok	1
therefore	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
carried	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
tarried	1
there.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
ascent	1
of	1
mount	1
Olivet,	1
and	1
wept	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
barefoot:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
covered	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up,	1
weeping	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
up.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
one	1
told	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Ahithophel	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
conspirators	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
turn	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel	1
into	1
foolishness.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mount,	1
where	1
he	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
behold,	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
rent,	1
and	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
head:	1
15:33	1
Unto	1
whom	1
David	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
passest	1
on	1
with	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:34	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servant,	1
O	1
king;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thy	1
father's	1
servant	1
hitherto,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
now	1
also	1
be	1
thy	1
servant:	1
then	1
mayest	1
thou	1
for	1
me	1
defeat	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
there	1
with	1
thee	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests?	1
	1
therefore	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
what	1
thing	1
soever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests.	1
	1
15:36	1
Behold,	1
they	1
have	1
there	1
with	1
them	1
their	1
two	1
sons,	1
Ahimaaz	1
Zadok's	1
son,	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
Abiathar's	1
son;	1
and	1
by	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
send	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
hear.	1
	1
15:37	1
So	1
Hushai	1
David's	1
friend	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
Absalom	1
came	1
into	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
past	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
behold,	1
Ziba	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Mephibosheth	1
met	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
asses	1
saddled,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
two	1
hundred	1
loaves	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
bunches	1
of	1
raisins,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
of	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Ziba,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou	1
by	1
these?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said,	1
The	1
asses	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
household	1
to	1
ride	1
on;	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
summer	1
fruit	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
eat;	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
that	1
such	1
as	1
be	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
may	1
drink.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
And	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
master's	1
son?	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
abideth	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
restore	1
me	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
16:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Ziba,	1
Behold,	1
thine	1
are	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
Mephibosheth.	1
And	1
Ziba	1
said,	1
I	1
humbly	1
beseech	1
thee	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
grace	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
when	1
king	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Bahurim,	1
behold,	1
thence	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Shimei,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera:	1
he	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
cursed	1
still	1
as	1
he	1
came.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
stones	1
at	1
David,	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
David:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
were	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
thus	1
said	1
Shimei	1
when	1
he	1
cursed,	1
Come	1
out,	1
come	1
out,	1
thou	1
bloody	1
man,	1
and	1
thou	1
man	1
of	1
Belial:	1
16:8	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
returned	1
upon	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
in	1
whose	1
stead	1
thou	1
hast	1
reigned;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
the	1
kingdom	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Absalom	1
thy	1
son:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
taken	1
in	1
thy	1
mischief,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
bloody	1
man.	1
	1
16:9	1
Then	1
said	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Why	1
should	1
this	1
dead	1
dog	1
curse	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
over,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah?	1
	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
curse,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Curse	1
David.	1
Who	1
shall	1
then	1
say,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
so?	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
my	1
bowels,	1
seeketh	1
my	1
life:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
now	1
may	1
this	1
Benjamite	1
do	1
it?	1
let	1
him	1
alone,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
curse;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
bidden	1
him.	1
	1
16:12	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
look	1
on	1
mine	1
affliction,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
requite	1
me	1
good	1
for	1
his	1
cursing	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
as	1
David	1
and	1
his	1
men	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
Shimei	1
went	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
hill's	1
side	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
cursed	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
and	1
threw	1
stones	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
dust.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
came	1
weary,	1
and	1
refreshed	1
themselves	1
there.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
Ahithophel	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite,	1
David's	1
friend,	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
that	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Absalom	1
said	1
to	1
Hushai,	1
Is	1
this	1
thy	1
kindness	1
to	1
thy	1
friend?	1
why	1
wentest	1
thou	1
not	1
with	1
thy	1
friend?	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
choose,	1
his	1
will	1
I	1
be,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
abide.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
again,	1
whom	1
should	1
I	1
serve?	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
serve	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
son?	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
served	1
in	1
thy	1
father's	1
presence,	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
presence.	1
	1
16:20	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom	1
to	1
Ahithophel,	1
Give	1
counsel	1
among	1
you	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
do.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
Ahithophel	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Go	1
in	1
unto	1
thy	1
father's	1
concubines,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
left	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
abhorred	1
of	1
thy	1
father:	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
thee	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:22	1
So	1
they	1
spread	1
Absalom	1
a	1
tent	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
Absalom	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
his	1
father's	1
concubines	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel,	1
which	1
he	1
counselled	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
enquired	1
at	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
God:	1
so	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel	1
both	1
with	1
David	1
and	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:1	1
Moreover	1
Ahithophel	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
choose	1
out	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
men,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
pursue	1
after	1
David	1
this	1
night:	1
17:2	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
weary	1
and	1
weak	1
handed,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
afraid:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
shall	1
flee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
king	1
only:	1
17:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
back	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
thee:	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
thou	1
seekest	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
returned:	1
so	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
Absalom	1
well,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Absalom,	1
Call	1
now	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
also,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
likewise	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
Hushai	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Absalom,	1
Absalom	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Ahithophel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
after	1
his	1
saying?	1
if	1
not;	1
speak	1
thou.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Hushai	1
said	1
unto	1
Absalom,	1
The	1
counsel	1
that	1
Ahithophel	1
hath	1
given	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
at	1
this	1
time.	1
	1
17:8	1
For,	1
said	1
Hushai,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
be	1
chafed	1
in	1
their	1
minds,	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
robbed	1
of	1
her	1
whelps	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
lodge	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:9	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
hid	1
now	1
in	1
some	1
pit,	1
or	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
place:	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
overthrown	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
it	1
will	1
say,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
slaughter	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
valiant,	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
shall	1
utterly	1
melt:	1
for	1
all	1
Israel	1
knoweth	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
valiant	1
men.	1
	1
17:11	1
Therefore	1
I	1
counsel	1
that	1
all	1
Israel	1
be	1
generally	1
gathered	1
unto	1
thee,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
multitude;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
go	1
to	1
battle	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
person.	1
	1
17:12	1
So	1
shall	1
we	1
come	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
found,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
light	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
falleth	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
one.	1
	1
17:13	1
Moreover,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
gotten	1
into	1
a	1
city,	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
Israel	1
bring	1
ropes	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
draw	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
river,	1
until	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
one	1
small	1
stone	1
found	1
there.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
Absalom	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
The	1
counsel	1
of	1
Hushai	1
the	1
Archite	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel.	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
good	1
counsel	1
of	1
Ahithophel,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
might	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
Absalom.	1
	1
17:15	1
Then	1
said	1
Hushai	1
unto	1
Zadok	1
and	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
did	1
Ahithophel	1
counsel	1
Absalom	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
thus	1
and	1
thus	1
have	1
I	1
counselled.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
send	1
quickly,	1
and	1
tell	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Lodge	1
not	1
this	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
but	1
speedily	1
pass	1
over;	1
lest	1
the	1
king	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:17	1
Now	1
Jonathan	1
and	1
Ahimaaz	1
stayed	1
by	1
Enrogel;	1
for	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
a	1
wench	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
king	1
David.	1
	1
17:18	1
Nevertheless	1
a	1
lad	1
saw	1
them,	1
and	1
told	1
Absalom:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
away	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
house	1
in	1
Bahurim,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
well	1
in	1
his	1
court;	1
whither	1
they	1
went	1
down.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
took	1
and	1
spread	1
a	1
covering	1
over	1
the	1
well's	1
mouth,	1
and	1
spread	1
ground	1
corn	1
thereon;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
known.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
when	1
Absalom's	1
servants	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
Ahimaaz	1
and	1
Jonathan?	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
be	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
of	1
water.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sought	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
them,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
17:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
king	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
pass	1
quickly	1
over	1
the	1
water:	1
for	1
thus	1
hath	1
Ahithophel	1
counselled	1
against	1
you.	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
David	1
arose,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan:	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
there	1
lacked	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
gone	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
when	1
Ahithophel	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
counsel	1
was	1
not	1
followed,	1
he	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
gat	1
him	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
to	1
his	1
city,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
household	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
hanged	1
himself,	1
and	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
17:24	1
Then	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Mahanaim.	1
And	1
Absalom	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
Absalom	1
made	1
Amasa	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
instead	1
of	1
Joab:	1
which	1
Amasa	1
was	1
a	1
man's	1
son,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Ithra	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
Abigail	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Nahash,	1
sister	1
to	1
Zeruiah	1
Joab's	1
mother.	1
	1
17:26	1
So	1
Israel	1
and	1
Absalom	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
17:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Mahanaim,	1
that	1
Shobi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahash	1
of	1
Rabbah	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
Machir	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ammiel	1
of	1
Lodebar,	1
and	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
of	1
Rogelim,	1
17:28	1
Brought	1
beds,	1
and	1
basons,	1
and	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
and	1
wheat,	1
and	1
barley,	1
and	1
flour,	1
and	1
parched	1
corn,	1
and	1
beans,	1
and	1
lentiles,	1
and	1
parched	1
pulse,	1
17:29	1
And	1
honey,	1
and	1
butter,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
cheese	1
of	1
kine,	1
for	1
David,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
eat:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
people	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
weary,	1
and	1
thirsty,	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
David	1
numbered	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
forth	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Joab,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
Joab's	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ittai	1
the	1
Gittite.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
you	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
18:3	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
flee	1
away,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
us;	1
neither	1
if	1
half	1
of	1
us	1
die,	1
will	1
they	1
care	1
for	1
us:	1
but	1
now	1
thou	1
art	1
worth	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
us:	1
therefore	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
thou	1
succour	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
seemeth	1
you	1
best	1
I	1
will	1
do.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
side,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
out	1
by	1
hundreds	1
and	1
by	1
thousands.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Joab	1
and	1
Abishai	1
and	1
Ittai,	1
saying,	1
Deal	1
gently	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
even	1
with	1
Absalom.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
gave	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
charge	1
concerning	1
Absalom.	1
	1
18:6	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
of	1
Ephraim;	1
18:7	1
Where	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
slain	1
before	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
18:8	1
For	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
there	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
country:	1
and	1
the	1
wood	1
devoured	1
more	1
people	1
that	1
day	1
than	1
the	1
sword	1
devoured.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
Absalom	1
met	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
Absalom	1
rode	1
upon	1
a	1
mule,	1
and	1
the	1
mule	1
went	1
under	1
the	1
thick	1
boughs	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
oak,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
oak,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
between	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
mule	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
him	1
went	1
away.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
told	1
Joab,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
saw	1
Absalom	1
hanged	1
in	1
an	1
oak.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
sawest	1
him,	1
and	1
why	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
smite	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
ten	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
a	1
girdle.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Though	1
I	1
should	1
receive	1
a	1
thousand	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
mine	1
hand,	1
yet	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
put	1
forth	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
king's	1
son:	1
for	1
in	1
our	1
hearing	1
the	1
king	1
charged	1
thee	1
and	1
Abishai	1
and	1
Ittai,	1
saying,	1
Beware	1
that	1
none	1
touch	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom.	1
	1
18:13	1
Otherwise	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
wrought	1
falsehood	1
against	1
mine	1
own	1
life:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
matter	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
thou	1
thyself	1
wouldest	1
have	1
set	1
thyself	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
18:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Joab,	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
tarry	1
thus	1
with	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
three	1
darts	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Absalom,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
oak.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
ten	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
bare	1
Joab's	1
armour	1
compassed	1
about	1
and	1
smote	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
Joab	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
from	1
pursuing	1
after	1
Israel:	1
for	1
Joab	1
held	1
back	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Absalom,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
great	1
pit	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
laid	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
stones	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
fled	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
18:18	1
Now	1
Absalom	1
in	1
his	1
lifetime	1
had	1
taken	1
and	1
reared	1
up	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
pillar,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
dale:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
son	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
name	1
in	1
remembrance:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
pillar	1
after	1
his	1
own	1
name:	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
Absalom's	1
place.	1
	1
18:19	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok,	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
run,	1
and	1
bear	1
the	1
king	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
18:20	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
tidings	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
tidings	1
another	1
day:	1
but	1
this	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bear	1
no	1
tidings,	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
18:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Joab	1
to	1
Cushi,	1
Go	1
tell	1
the	1
king	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen.	1
And	1
Cushi	1
bowed	1
himself	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
and	1
ran.	1
	1
18:22	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok	1
yet	1
again	1
to	1
Joab,	1
But	1
howsoever,	1
let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
also	1
run	1
after	1
Cushi.	1
And	1
Joab	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
wilt	1
thou	1
run,	1
my	1
son,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
tidings	1
ready?	1
	1
18:23	1
But	1
howsoever,	1
said	1
he,	1
let	1
me	1
run.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Run.	1
Then	1
Ahimaaz	1
ran	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
overran	1
Cushi.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
David	1
sat	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
gates:	1
and	1
the	1
watchman	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
over	1
the	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
running	1
alone.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
cried,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
alone,	1
there	1
is	1
tidings	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
apace,	1
and	1
drew	1
near.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
saw	1
another	1
man	1
running:	1
and	1
the	1
watchman	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
porter,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
another	1
man	1
running	1
alone.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
He	1
also	1
bringeth	1
tidings.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
said,	1
Me	1
thinketh	1
the	1
running	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
running	1
of	1
Ahimaaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
cometh	1
with	1
good	1
tidings.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
Ahimaaz	1
called,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
All	1
is	1
well.	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
hand	1
against	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Is	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
safe?	1
And	1
Ahimaaz	1
answered,	1
When	1
Joab	1
sent	1
the	1
king's	1
servant,	1
and	1
me	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
tumult,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Turn	1
aside,	1
and	1
stand	1
here.	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
18:31	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Cushi	1
came;	1
and	1
Cushi	1
said,	1
Tidings,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
avenged	1
thee	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
18:32	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Cushi,	1
Is	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Absalom	1
safe?	1
And	1
Cushi	1
answered,	1
The	1
enemies	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
rise	1
against	1
thee	1
to	1
do	1
thee	1
hurt,	1
be	1
as	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
is.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
much	1
moved,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
over	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
wept:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
thus	1
he	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom!	1
would	1
God	1
I	1
had	1
died	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son!	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Joab,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
weepeth	1
and	1
mourneth	1
for	1
Absalom.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
turned	1
into	1
mourning	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
day	1
how	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
grieved	1
for	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gat	1
them	1
by	1
stealth	1
that	1
day	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
as	1
people	1
being	1
ashamed	1
steal	1
away	1
when	1
they	1
flee	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
19:4	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
covered	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
O	1
my	1
son	1
Absalom,	1
O	1
Absalom,	1
my	1
son,	1
my	1
son!	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
Joab	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shamed	1
this	1
day	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
saved	1
thy	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
daughters,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
thy	1
concubines;	1
19:6	1
In	1
that	1
thou	1
lovest	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
hatest	1
thy	1
friends.	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
declared	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
thou	1
regardest	1
neither	1
princes	1
nor	1
servants:	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
I	1
perceive,	1
that	1
if	1
Absalom	1
had	1
lived,	1
and	1
all	1
we	1
had	1
died	1
this	1
day,	1
then	1
it	1
had	1
pleased	1
thee	1
well.	1
	1
19:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
arise,	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
speak	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants:	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
if	1
thou	1
go	1
not	1
forth,	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
tarry	1
one	1
with	1
thee	1
this	1
night:	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
unto	1
thee	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
befell	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
youth	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
19:8	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king	1
doth	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
gate.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
Israel	1
had	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
at	1
strife	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
The	1
king	1
saved	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
Absalom.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
Absalom,	1
whom	1
we	1
anointed	1
over	1
us,	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
battle.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
speak	1
ye	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
bringing	1
the	1
king	1
back?	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
sent	1
to	1
Zadok	1
and	1
to	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
Speak	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
king	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
house?	1
seeing	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
all	1
Israel	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
19:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
bones	1
and	1
my	1
flesh:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
Amasa,	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
bone,	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
flesh?	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
before	1
me	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
Joab.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
he	1
bowed	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
one	1
man;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Return	1
thou,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
19:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
returned,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan.	1
And	1
Judah	1
came	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
conduct	1
the	1
king	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera,	1
a	1
Benjamite,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bahurim,	1
hasted	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
meet	1
king	1
David.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
men	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
Ziba	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
his	1
fifteen	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
twenty	1
servants	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
over	1
a	1
ferry	1
boat	1
to	1
carry	1
over	1
the	1
king's	1
household,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
good.	1
And	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
over	1
Jordan;	1
19:19	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
lord	1
impute	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
me,	1
neither	1
do	1
thou	1
remember	1
that	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
did	1
perversely	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
19:20	1
For	1
thy	1
servant	1
doth	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sinned:	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
the	1
first	1
this	1
day	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
19:21	1
But	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Shall	1
not	1
Shimei	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
this,	1
because	1
he	1
cursed	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anointed?	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you,	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
adversaries	1
unto	1
me?	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
Israel?	1
for	1
do	1
not	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
king	1
over	1
Israel?	1
	1
19:23	1
Therefore	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Shimei,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
die.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sware	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
had	1
neither	1
dressed	1
his	1
feet,	1
nor	1
trimmed	1
his	1
beard,	1
nor	1
washed	1
his	1
clothes,	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
the	1
king	1
departed	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
19:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherefore	1
wentest	1
not	1
thou	1
with	1
me,	1
Mephibosheth?	1
	1
19:26	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
my	1
servant	1
deceived	1
me:	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
saddle	1
me	1
an	1
ass,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
ride	1
thereon,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
king;	1
because	1
thy	1
servant	1
is	1
lame.	1
	1
19:27	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
slandered	1
thy	1
servant	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king;	1
but	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God:	1
do	1
therefore	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:28	1
For	1
all	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
were	1
but	1
dead	1
men	1
before	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
yet	1
didst	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
servant	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
at	1
thine	1
own	1
table.	1
What	1
right	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
yet	1
to	1
cry	1
any	1
more	1
unto	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
speakest	1
thou	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
thy	1
matters?	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
Thou	1
and	1
Ziba	1
divide	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
Mephibosheth	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Yea,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
all,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
come	1
again	1
in	1
peace	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Gileadite	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Rogelim,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
with	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
conduct	1
him	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
	1
19:32	1
Now	1
Barzillai	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
aged	1
man,	1
even	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
provided	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
sustenance	1
while	1
he	1
lay	1
at	1
Mahanaim;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
man.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Barzillai,	1
Come	1
thou	1
over	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
thee	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
Barzillai	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
How	1
long	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
live,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
19:35	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
day	1
fourscore	1
years	1
old:	1
and	1
can	1
I	1
discern	1
between	1
good	1
and	1
evil?	1
can	1
thy	1
servant	1
taste	1
what	1
I	1
eat	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
drink?	1
can	1
I	1
hear	1
any	1
more	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
singing	1
men	1
and	1
singing	1
women?	1
wherefore	1
then	1
should	1
thy	1
servant	1
be	1
yet	1
a	1
burden	1
unto	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
19:36	1
Thy	1
servant	1
will	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
over	1
Jordan	1
with	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
king	1
recompense	1
it	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
reward?	1
	1
19:37	1
Let	1
thy	1
servant,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
turn	1
back	1
again,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
die	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
city,	1
and	1
be	1
buried	1
by	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
mother.	1
But	1
behold	1
thy	1
servant	1
Chimham;	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
over	1
with	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king;	1
and	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered,	1
Chimham	1
shall	1
go	1
over	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
thee:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
require	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
come	1
over,	1
the	1
king	1
kissed	1
Barzillai,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
returned	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
Chimham	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
conducted	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
also	1
half	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:41	1
And,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Why	1
have	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
stolen	1
thee	1
away,	1
and	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
all	1
David's	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
over	1
Jordan?	1
	1
19:42	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
answered	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Because	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
near	1
of	1
kin	1
to	1
us:	1
wherefore	1
then	1
be	1
ye	1
angry	1
for	1
this	1
matter?	1
have	1
we	1
eaten	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
cost?	1
or	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
us	1
any	1
gift?	1
	1
19:43	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
answered	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
ten	1
parts	1
in	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
also	1
more	1
right	1
in	1
David	1
than	1
ye:	1
why	1
then	1
did	1
ye	1
despise	1
us,	1
that	1
our	1
advice	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
first	1
had	1
in	1
bringing	1
back	1
our	1
king?	1
And	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
fiercer	1
than	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Belial,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Sheba,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri,	1
a	1
Benjamite:	1
and	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
David,	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse:	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tents,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:2	1
So	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
after	1
David,	1
and	1
followed	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri:	1
but	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
clave	1
unto	1
their	1
king,	1
from	1
Jordan	1
even	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
the	1
ten	1
women	1
his	1
concubines,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
ward,	1
and	1
fed	1
them,	1
but	1
went	1
not	1
in	1
unto	1
them.	1
So	1
they	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
death,	1
living	1
in	1
widowhood.	1
	1
20:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Amasa,	1
Assemble	1
me	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
within	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
here	1
present.	1
	1
20:5	1
So	1
Amasa	1
went	1
to	1
assemble	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah:	1
but	1
he	1
tarried	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
set	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
appointed	1
him.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Abishai,	1
Now	1
shall	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri	1
do	1
us	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
did	1
Absalom:	1
take	1
thou	1
thy	1
lord's	1
servants,	1
and	1
pursue	1
after	1
him,	1
lest	1
he	1
get	1
him	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
escape	1
us.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
him	1
Joab's	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
pursue	1
after	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri.	1
	1
20:8	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
great	1
stone	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Gibeon,	1
Amasa	1
went	1
before	1
them.	1
And	1
Joab's	1
garment	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
was	1
girded	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
upon	1
it	1
a	1
girdle	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
fastened	1
upon	1
his	1
loins	1
in	1
the	1
sheath	1
thereof;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
it	1
fell	1
out.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
to	1
Amasa,	1
Art	1
thou	1
in	1
health,	1
my	1
brother?	1
And	1
Joab	1
took	1
Amasa	1
by	1
the	1
beard	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
	1
20:10	1
But	1
Amasa	1
took	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
sword	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Joab's	1
hand:	1
so	1
he	1
smote	1
him	1
therewith	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
rib,	1
and	1
shed	1
out	1
his	1
bowels	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
struck	1
him	1
not	1
again;	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
So	1
Joab	1
and	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother	1
pursued	1
after	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
Joab's	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
favoureth	1
Joab,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
for	1
David,	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
after	1
Joab.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
Amasa	1
wallowed	1
in	1
blood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
highway.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
saw	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
still,	1
he	1
removed	1
Amasa	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
highway	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
cast	1
a	1
cloth	1
upon	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
came	1
by	1
him	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
20:13	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
removed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
highway,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
Joab,	1
to	1
pursue	1
after	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
Abel,	1
and	1
to	1
Bethmaachah,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Berites:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
also	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
besieged	1
him	1
in	1
Abel	1
of	1
Bethmaachah,	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
up	1
a	1
bank	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
trench:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Joab	1
battered	1
the	1
wall,	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
down.	1
	1
20:16	1
Then	1
cried	1
a	1
wise	1
woman	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
Hear,	1
hear;	1
say,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Come	1
near	1
hither,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near	1
unto	1
her,	1
the	1
woman	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
Joab?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
Then	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
do	1
hear.	1
	1
20:18	1
Then	1
she	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
They	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
old	1
time,	1
saying,	1
They	1
shall	1
surely	1
ask	1
counsel	1
at	1
Abel:	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
ended	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
20:19	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
peaceable	1
and	1
faithful	1
in	1
Israel:	1
thou	1
seekest	1
to	1
destroy	1
a	1
city	1
and	1
a	1
mother	1
in	1
Israel:	1
why	1
wilt	1
thou	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
Joab	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Far	1
be	1
it,	1
far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
swallow	1
up	1
or	1
destroy.	1
	1
20:21	1
The	1
matter	1
is	1
not	1
so:	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri	1
by	1
name,	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
king,	1
even	1
against	1
David:	1
deliver	1
him	1
only,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
Joab,	1
Behold,	1
his	1
head	1
shall	1
be	1
thrown	1
to	1
thee	1
over	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
20:22	1
Then	1
the	1
woman	1
went	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
her	1
wisdom.	1
And	1
they	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Sheba	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bichri,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
Joab.	1
And	1
he	1
blew	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
they	1
retired	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
And	1
Joab	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
20:23	1
Now	1
Joab	1
was	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
Cherethites	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
Pelethites:	1
20:24	1
And	1
Adoram	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
tribute:	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud	1
was	1
recorder:	1
20:25	1
And	1
Sheva	1
was	1
scribe:	1
and	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
were	1
the	1
priests:	1
20:26	1
And	1
Ira	1
also	1
the	1
Jairite	1
was	1
a	1
chief	1
ruler	1
about	1
David.	1
	1
21:1	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David	1
three	1
years,	1
year	1
after	1
year;	1
and	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
Saul,	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
bloody	1
house,	1
because	1
he	1
slew	1
the	1
Gibeonites.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
called	1
the	1
Gibeonites,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them;	1
(now	1
the	1
Gibeonites	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
sworn	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
Saul	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
zeal	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.)	1
21:3	1
Wherefore	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Gibeonites,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
you?	1
	1
and	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
atonement,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bless	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
the	1
Gibeonites	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
silver	1
nor	1
gold	1
of	1
Saul,	1
nor	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
neither	1
for	1
us	1
shalt	1
thou	1
kill	1
any	1
man	1
in	1
Israel.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
consumed	1
us,	1
and	1
that	1
devised	1
against	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
remaining	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel,	1
21:6	1
Let	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
hang	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
of	1
Saul,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
choose.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
them.	1
	1
21:7	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
spared	1
Mephibosheth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
oath	1
that	1
was	1
between	1
them,	1
between	1
David	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
21:8	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Rizpah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aiah,	1
whom	1
she	1
bare	1
unto	1
Saul,	1
Armoni	1
and	1
Mephibosheth;	1
and	1
the	1
five	1
sons	1
of	1
Michal	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul,	1
whom	1
she	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
Adriel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Meholathite:	1
21:9	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gibeonites,	1
and	1
they	1
hanged	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
all	1
seven	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
harvest,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
barley	1
harvest.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
Rizpah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aiah	1
took	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
for	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
rock,	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
harvest	1
until	1
water	1
dropped	1
upon	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
suffered	1
neither	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
them	1
by	1
day,	1
nor	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
David	1
what	1
Rizpah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Aiah,	1
the	1
concubine	1
of	1
Saul,	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jabeshgilead,	1
which	1
had	1
stolen	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
Bethshan,	1
where	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
hanged	1
them,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
slain	1
Saul	1
in	1
Gilboa:	1
21:13	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son;	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
hanged.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Saul	1
and	1
Jonathan	1
his	1
son	1
buried	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
in	1
Zelah,	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Kish	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
they	1
performed	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
commanded.	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
intreated	1
for	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
21:15	1
Moreover	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
yet	1
war	1
again	1
with	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
David	1
waxed	1
faint.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
Ishbibenob,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
giant,	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
whose	1
spear	1
weighed	1
three	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
brass	1
in	1
weight,	1
he	1
being	1
girded	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
sword,	1
thought	1
to	1
have	1
slain	1
David.	1
	1
21:17	1
But	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
succoured	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistine,	1
and	1
killed	1
him.	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
David	1
sware	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
no	1
more	1
out	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
battle,	1
that	1
thou	1
quench	1
not	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
again	1
a	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines	1
at	1
Gob:	1
then	1
Sibbechai	1
the	1
Hushathite	1
slew	1
Saph,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
giant.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
again	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
Gob	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
where	1
Elhanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jaareoregim,	1
a	1
Bethlehemite,	1
slew	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Gittite,	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
whose	1
spear	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
Gath,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
stature,	1
that	1
had	1
on	1
every	1
hand	1
six	1
fingers,	1
and	1
on	1
every	1
foot	1
six	1
toes,	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
in	1
number;	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
the	1
giant.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
defied	1
Israel,	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeah	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
David	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
21:22	1
These	1
four	1
were	1
born	1
to	1
the	1
giant	1
in	1
Gath,	1
and	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
David	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
song	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Saul:	1
22:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
rock,	1
and	1
my	1
fortress,	1
and	1
my	1
deliverer;	1
22:3	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
rock;	1
in	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
trust:	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
shield,	1
and	1
the	1
horn	1
of	1
my	1
salvation,	1
my	1
high	1
tower,	1
and	1
my	1
refuge,	1
my	1
saviour;	1
thou	1
savest	1
me	1
from	1
violence.	1
	1
22:4	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
praised:	1
so	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies.	1
	1
22:5	1
When	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
death	1
compassed	1
me,	1
the	1
floods	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men	1
made	1
me	1
afraid;	1
22:6	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
hell	1
compassed	1
me	1
about;	1
the	1
snares	1
of	1
death	1
prevented	1
me;	1
22:7	1
In	1
my	1
distress	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
cried	1
to	1
my	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
hear	1
my	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
temple,	1
and	1
my	1
cry	1
did	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
ears.	1
	1
22:8	1
Then	1
the	1
earth	1
shook	1
and	1
trembled;	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
heaven	1
moved	1
and	1
shook,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
wroth.	1
	1
22:9	1
There	1
went	1
up	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils,	1
and	1
fire	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
devoured:	1
coals	1
were	1
kindled	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
22:10	1
He	1
bowed	1
the	1
heavens	1
also,	1
and	1
came	1
down;	1
and	1
darkness	1
was	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
he	1
rode	1
upon	1
a	1
cherub,	1
and	1
did	1
fly:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
darkness	1
pavilions	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
dark	1
waters,	1
and	1
thick	1
clouds	1
of	1
the	1
skies.	1
	1
22:13	1
Through	1
the	1
brightness	1
before	1
him	1
were	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
kindled.	1
	1
22:14	1
The	1
LORD	1
thundered	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
uttered	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
arrows,	1
and	1
scattered	1
them;	1
lightning,	1
and	1
discomfited	1
them.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
appeared,	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
were	1
discovered,	1
at	1
the	1
rebuking	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
blast	1
of	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils.	1
	1
22:17	1
He	1
sent	1
from	1
above,	1
he	1
took	1
me;	1
he	1
drew	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
waters;	1
22:18	1
He	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
strong	1
enemy,	1
and	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
hated	1
me:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
They	1
prevented	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
calamity:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
my	1
stay.	1
	1
22:20	1
He	1
brought	1
me	1
forth	1
also	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
place:	1
he	1
delivered	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
delighted	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
22:21	1
The	1
LORD	1
rewarded	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
righteousness:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
cleanness	1
of	1
my	1
hands	1
hath	1
he	1
recompensed	1
me.	1
	1
22:22	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
wickedly	1
departed	1
from	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
22:23	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
judgments	1
were	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
statutes,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
22:24	1
I	1
was	1
also	1
upright	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
mine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
22:25	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
recompensed	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
righteousness;	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
cleanness	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
sight.	1
	1
22:26	1
With	1
the	1
merciful	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
merciful,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
upright	1
man	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
upright.	1
	1
22:27	1
With	1
the	1
pure	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
pure;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
froward	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shew	1
thyself	1
unsavoury.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
afflicted	1
people	1
thou	1
wilt	1
save:	1
but	1
thine	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
haughty,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
bring	1
them	1
down.	1
	1
22:29	1
For	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
lamp,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
lighten	1
my	1
darkness.	1
	1
22:30	1
For	1
by	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
run	1
through	1
a	1
troop:	1
by	1
my	1
God	1
have	1
I	1
leaped	1
over	1
a	1
wall.	1
	1
22:31	1
As	1
for	1
God,	1
his	1
way	1
is	1
perfect;	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
tried:	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
buckler	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
22:32	1
For	1
who	1
is	1
God,	1
save	1
the	1
LORD?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
rock,	1
save	1
our	1
God?	1
22:33	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
power:	1
and	1
he	1
maketh	1
my	1
way	1
perfect.	1
	1
22:34	1
He	1
maketh	1
my	1
feet	1
like	1
hinds'	1
feet:	1
and	1
setteth	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
22:35	1
He	1
teacheth	1
my	1
hands	1
to	1
war;	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
bow	1
of	1
steel	1
is	1
broken	1
by	1
mine	1
arms.	1
	1
22:36	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
thy	1
salvation:	1
and	1
thy	1
gentleness	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
great.	1
	1
22:37	1
Thou	1
hast	1
enlarged	1
my	1
steps	1
under	1
me;	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
feet	1
did	1
not	1
slip.	1
	1
22:38	1
I	1
have	1
pursued	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them;	1
and	1
turned	1
not	1
again	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
consumed	1
them,	1
and	1
wounded	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
arise:	1
yea,	1
they	1
are	1
fallen	1
under	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
22:40	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
girded	1
me	1
with	1
strength	1
to	1
battle:	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
me	1
hast	1
thou	1
subdued	1
under	1
me.	1
	1
22:41	1
Thou	1
hast	1
also	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
destroy	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
me.	1
	1
22:42	1
They	1
looked,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
to	1
save;	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
22:43	1
Then	1
did	1
I	1
beat	1
them	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
I	1
did	1
stamp	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
did	1
spread	1
them	1
abroad.	1
	1
22:44	1
Thou	1
also	1
hast	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
strivings	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
heathen:	1
a	1
people	1
which	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
shall	1
serve	1
me.	1
	1
22:45	1
Strangers	1
shall	1
submit	1
themselves	1
unto	1
me:	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
hear,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
22:46	1
Strangers	1
shall	1
fade	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
close	1
places.	1
	1
22:47	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth;	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
my	1
rock;	1
and	1
exalted	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
22:48	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
avengeth	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
bringeth	1
down	1
the	1
people	1
under	1
me.	1
	1
22:49	1
And	1
that	1
bringeth	1
me	1
forth	1
from	1
mine	1
enemies:	1
thou	1
also	1
hast	1
lifted	1
me	1
up	1
on	1
high	1
above	1
them	1
that	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
me:	1
thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
violent	1
man.	1
	1
22:50	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
praises	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
22:51	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
salvation	1
for	1
his	1
king:	1
and	1
sheweth	1
mercy	1
to	1
his	1
anointed,	1
unto	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
23:1	1
Now	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
David.	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
the	1
anointed	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
the	1
sweet	1
psalmist	1
of	1
Israel,	1
said,	1
23:2	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
tongue.	1
	1
23:3	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
the	1
Rock	1
of	1
Israel	1
spake	1
to	1
me,	1
He	1
that	1
ruleth	1
over	1
men	1
must	1
be	1
just,	1
ruling	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
riseth,	1
even	1
a	1
morning	1
without	1
clouds;	1
as	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
springing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
clear	1
shining	1
after	1
rain.	1
	1
23:5	1
Although	1
my	1
house	1
be	1
not	1
so	1
with	1
God;	1
yet	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
with	1
me	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
ordered	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
sure:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
my	1
salvation,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
desire,	1
although	1
he	1
make	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
grow.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
thorns	1
thrust	1
away,	1
because	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
taken	1
with	1
hands:	1
23:7	1
But	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
touch	1
them	1
must	1
be	1
fenced	1
with	1
iron	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
a	1
spear;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
burned	1
with	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place.	1
	1
23:8	1
These	1
be	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
whom	1
David	1
had:	1
The	1
Tachmonite	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
seat,	1
chief	1
among	1
the	1
captains;	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
Adino	1
the	1
Eznite:	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
spear	1
against	1
eight	1
hundred,	1
whom	1
he	1
slew	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Dodo	1
the	1
Ahohite,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
mighty	1
men	1
with	1
David,	1
when	1
they	1
defied	1
the	1
Philistines	1
that	1
were	1
there	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
gone	1
away:	1
23:10	1
He	1
arose,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines	1
until	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
weary,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
clave	1
unto	1
the	1
sword:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
wrought	1
a	1
great	1
victory	1
that	1
day;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
after	1
him	1
only	1
to	1
spoil.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
Shammah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Agee	1
the	1
Hararite.	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
troop,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ground	1
full	1
of	1
lentiles:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
23:12	1
But	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
defended	1
it,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
wrought	1
a	1
great	1
victory.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1
chief	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
David	1
in	1
the	1
harvest	1
time	1
unto	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Adullam:	1
and	1
the	1
troop	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
an	1
hold,	1
and	1
the	1
garrison	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
23:15	1
And	1
David	1
longed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
gate!	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
mighty	1
men	1
brake	1
through	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
drew	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
David:	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink	1
thereof,	1
but	1
poured	1
it	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
this:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
went	1
in	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
their	1
lives?	1
therefore	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink	1
it.	1
These	1
things	1
did	1
these	1
three	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
Abishai,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Joab,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
was	1
chief	1
among	1
three.	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
spear	1
against	1
three	1
hundred,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
name	1
among	1
three.	1
	1
23:19	1
Was	1
he	1
not	1
most	1
honourable	1
of	1
three?	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
their	1
captain:	1
howbeit	1
he	1
attained	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
first	1
three.	1
	1
23:20	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
valiant	1
man,	1
of	1
Kabzeel,	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
many	1
acts,	1
he	1
slew	1
two	1
lionlike	1
men	1
of	1
Moab:	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
also	1
and	1
slew	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
pit	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
snow:	1
23:21	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
a	1
goodly	1
man:	1
and	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
had	1
a	1
spear	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
staff,	1
and	1
plucked	1
the	1
spear	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptian's	1
hand,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
spear.	1
	1
23:22	1
These	1
things	1
did	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
name	1
among	1
three	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
23:23	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
the	1
thirty,	1
but	1
he	1
attained	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
three.	1
And	1
David	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
his	1
guard.	1
	1
23:24	1
Asahel	1

	1
24:1	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
David	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
say,	1
Go,	1
number	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
24:2	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
Joab	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
Go	1
now	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
number	1
ye	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
Joab	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
add	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
how	1
many	1
soever	1
they	1
be,	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
may	1
see	1
it:	1
but	1
why	1
doth	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
delight	1
in	1
this	1
thing?	1
	1
24:4	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
king's	1
word	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Joab,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host.	1
And	1
Joab	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
to	1
number	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
they	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
pitched	1
in	1
Aroer,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
lieth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Gad,	1
and	1
toward	1
Jazer:	1
24:6	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Tahtimhodshi;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Danjaan,	1
and	1
about	1
to	1
Zidon,	1
24:7	1
And	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Judah,	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
24:8	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
nine	1
months	1
and	1
twenty	1
days.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
Joab	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
eight	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
valiant	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
David's	1
heart	1
smote	1
him	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
numbered	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
greatly	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done:	1
and	1
now,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
foolishly.	1
	1
24:11	1
For	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
Gad,	1
David's	1
seer,	1
saying,	1
24:12	1
Go	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
offer	1
thee	1
three	1
things;	1
choose	1
thee	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
24:13	1
So	1
Gad	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Shall	1
seven	1
years	1
of	1
famine	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
land?	1
or	1
wilt	1
thou	1
flee	1
three	1
months	1
before	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
while	1
they	1
pursue	1
thee?	1
or	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
three	1
days'	1
pestilence	1
in	1
thy	1
land?	1
now	1
advise,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
answer	1
I	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Gad,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
strait:	1
let	1
us	1
fall	1
now	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
his	1
mercies	1
are	1
great:	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
24:15	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
a	1
pestilence	1
upon	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
appointed:	1
and	1
there	1
died	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
destroy	1
it,	1
the	1
LORD	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
people,	1
It	1
is	1
enough:	1
stay	1
now	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
threshingplace	1
of	1
Araunah	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
David	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly:	1
but	1
these	1
sheep,	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
done?	1
let	1
thine	1
hand,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
against	1
my	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
Gad	1
came	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
up,	1
rear	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Araunah	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
David,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Gad,	1
went	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
Araunah	1
looked,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
coming	1
on	1
toward	1
him:	1
and	1
Araunah	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
Araunah	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
servant?	1
	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
To	1
buy	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
thee,	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
plague	1
may	1
be	1
stayed	1
from	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
Araunah	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
take	1
and	1
offer	1
up	1
what	1
seemeth	1
good	1
unto	1
him:	1
behold,	1
here	1
be	1
oxen	1
for	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
threshing	1
instruments	1
and	1
other	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
oxen	1
for	1
wood.	1
	1
24:23	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
did	1
Araunah,	1
as	1
a	1
king,	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
Araunah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
accept	1
thee.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Araunah,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
buy	1
it	1
of	1
thee	1
at	1
a	1
price:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
doth	1
cost	1
me	1
nothing.	1
So	1
David	1
bought	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
and	1
the	1
oxen	1
for	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
David	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
intreated	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
plague	1
was	1
stayed	1
from	1
Israel.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
Commonly	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
Third	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
king	1
David	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
stricken	1
in	1
years;	1
and	1
they	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
clothes,	1
but	1
he	1
gat	1
no	1
heat.	1
	1
1:2	1
Wherefore	1
his	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
sought	1
for	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
a	1
young	1
virgin:	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
cherish	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
lie	1
in	1
thy	1
bosom,	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
may	1
get	1
heat.	1
	1
1:3	1
So	1
they	1
sought	1
for	1
a	1
fair	1
damsel	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
found	1
Abishag	1
a	1
Shunammite,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
very	1
fair,	1
and	1
cherished	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
ministered	1
to	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
knew	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
1:5	1
Then	1
Adonijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haggith	1
exalted	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
king:	1
and	1
he	1
prepared	1
him	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
fifty	1
men	1
to	1
run	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
not	1
displeased	1
him	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
in	1
saying,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
so?	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
goodly	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
bare	1
him	1
after	1
Absalom.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
conferred	1
with	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah,	1
and	1
with	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest:	1
and	1
they	1
following	1
Adonijah	1
helped	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Shimei,	1
and	1
Rei,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
David,	1
were	1
not	1
with	1
Adonijah.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
Adonijah	1
slew	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen	1
and	1
fat	1
cattle	1
by	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
Zoheleth,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
Enrogel,	1
and	1
called	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
the	1
king's	1
servants:	1
1:10	1
But	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
Solomon	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
called	1
not.	1
	1
1:11	1
Wherefore	1
Nathan	1
spake	1
unto	1
Bathsheba	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
saying,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard	1
that	1
Adonijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haggith	1
doth	1
reign,	1
and	1
David	1
our	1
lord	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not?	1
	1
1:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
come,	1
let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
give	1
thee	1
counsel,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
save	1
thine	1
own	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thy	1
son	1
Solomon.	1
	1
1:13	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
in	1
unto	1
king	1
David,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Didst	1
not	1
thou,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
swear	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
saying,	1
Assuredly	1
Solomon	1
thy	1
son	1
shall	1
reign	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
my	1
throne?	1
why	1
then	1
doth	1
Adonijah	1
reign?	1
	1
1:14	1
Behold,	1
while	1
thou	1
yet	1
talkest	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
after	1
thee,	1
and	1
confirm	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
Bathsheba	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
into	1
the	1
chamber:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
very	1
old;	1
and	1
Abishag	1
the	1
Shunammite	1
ministered	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
Bathsheba	1
bowed,	1
and	1
did	1
obeisance	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
What	1
wouldest	1
thou?	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
lord,	1
thou	1
swarest	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid,	1
saying,	1
Assuredly	1
Solomon	1
thy	1
son	1
shall	1
reign	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
my	1
throne.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
Adonijah	1
reigneth;	1
and	1
now,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
not:	1
1:19	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
slain	1
oxen	1
and	1
fat	1
cattle	1
and	1
sheep	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
hath	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Joab	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host:	1
but	1
Solomon	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
called.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
thou,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
Israel	1
are	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
tell	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:21	1
Otherwise	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
sleep	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
Solomon	1
shall	1
be	1
counted	1
offenders.	1
	1
1:22	1
And,	1
lo,	1
while	1
she	1
yet	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
king,	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet	1
also	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
bowed	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
Nathan	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
hast	1
thou	1
said,	1
Adonijah	1
shall	1
reign	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
my	1
throne?	1
	1
1:25	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
hath	1
slain	1
oxen	1
and	1
fat	1
cattle	1
and	1
sheep	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
hath	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
say,	1
God	1
save	1
king	1
Adonijah.	1
	1
1:26	1
But	1
me,	1
even	1
me	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
and	1
thy	1
servant	1
Solomon,	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
called.	1
	1
1:27	1
Is	1
this	1
thing	1
done	1
by	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
shewed	1
it	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant,	1
who	1
should	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
after	1
him?	1
	1
1:28	1
Then	1
king	1
David	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Call	1
me	1
Bathsheba.	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
presence,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sware,	1
and	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
that	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
my	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
distress,	1
1:30	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
sware	1
unto	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Assuredly	1
Solomon	1
thy	1
son	1
shall	1
reign	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
my	1
throne	1
in	1
my	1
stead;	1
even	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
certainly	1
do	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
1:31	1
Then	1
Bathsheba	1
bowed	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
did	1
reverence	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
king	1
David	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
said,	1
Call	1
me	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:33	1
The	1
king	1
also	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
with	1
you	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
your	1
lord,	1
and	1
cause	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
mine	1
own	1
mule,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Gihon:	1
1:34	1
And	1
let	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet	1
anoint	1
him	1
there	1
king	1
over	1
Israel:	1
and	1
blow	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
say,	1
God	1
save	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
1:35	1
Then	1
ye	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
after	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
upon	1
my	1
throne;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
in	1
my	1
stead:	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
appointed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
over	1
Israel	1
and	1
over	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:36	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
Amen:	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
say	1
so	1
too.	1
	1
1:37	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
with	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
even	1
so	1
be	1
he	1
with	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
throne	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
king	1
David.	1
	1
1:38	1
So	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
and	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites,	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
caused	1
Solomon	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
king	1
David's	1
mule,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Gihon.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
an	1
horn	1
of	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
anointed	1
Solomon.	1
And	1
they	1
blew	1
the	1
trumpet;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
said,	1
God	1
save	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
1:40	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
up	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
piped	1
with	1
pipes,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
great	1
joy,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
rent	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
Adonijah	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
it	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
eating.	1
And	1
when	1
Joab	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
is	1
this	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
being	1
in	1
an	1
uproar?	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold,	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest	1
came;	1
and	1
Adonijah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
in;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
valiant	1
man,	1
and	1
bringest	1
good	1
tidings.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
Jonathan	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Adonijah,	1
Verily	1
our	1
lord	1
king	1
David	1
hath	1
made	1
Solomon	1
king.	1
	1
1:44	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
sent	1
with	1
him	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
and	1
the	1
Cherethites,	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
ride	1
upon	1
the	1
king's	1
mule:	1
1:45	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet	1
have	1
anointed	1
him	1
king	1
in	1
Gihon:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
rejoicing,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
rang	1
again.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
noise	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
also	1
Solomon	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
1:47	1
And	1
moreover	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
came	1
to	1
bless	1
our	1
lord	1
king	1
David,	1
saying,	1
God	1
make	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Solomon	1
better	1
than	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
throne	1
greater	1
than	1
thy	1
throne.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
bowed	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
1:48	1
And	1
also	1
thus	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
hath	1
given	1
one	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
throne	1
this	1
day,	1
mine	1
eyes	1
even	1
seeing	1
it.	1
	1
1:49	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
Adonijah	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
went	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
1:50	1
And	1
Adonijah	1
feared	1
because	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
caught	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
1:51	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Solomon,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
Adonijah	1
feareth	1
king	1
Solomon:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
he	1
hath	1
caught	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
king	1
Solomon	1
swear	1
unto	1
me	1
today	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
slay	1
his	1
servant	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
1:52	1
And	1
Solomon	1
said,	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
himself	1
a	1
worthy	1
man,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
him	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
if	1
wickedness	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
1:53	1
So	1
king	1
Solomon	1
sent,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
altar.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon:	1
and	1
Solomon	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
to	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David	1
drew	1
nigh	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
die;	1
and	1
he	1
charged	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
I	1
go	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
be	1
thou	1
strong	1
therefore,	1
and	1
shew	1
thyself	1
a	1
man;	1
2:3	1
And	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
doest,	1
and	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
turnest	1
thyself:	1
2:4	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
may	1
continue	1
his	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
me,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thy	1
children	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
their	1
way,	1
to	1
walk	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
truth	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
soul,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
thee	1
(said	1
he)	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:5	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
knowest	1
also	1
what	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
did	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
hosts	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
and	1
unto	1
Amasa	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jether,	1
whom	1
he	1
slew,	1
and	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
war	1
upon	1
his	1
girdle	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
shoes	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
2:6	1
Do	1
therefore	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
his	1
hoar	1
head	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
2:7	1
But	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Barzillai	1
the	1
Gileadite,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
eat	1
at	1
thy	1
table:	1
for	1
so	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
fled	1
because	1
of	1
Absalom	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
2:8	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
with	1
thee	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gera,	1
a	1
Benjamite	1
of	1
Bahurim,	1
which	1
cursed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
grievous	1
curse	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Mahanaim:	1
but	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
me	1
at	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
I	1
sware	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
death	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
2:9	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hold	1
him	1
not	1
guiltless:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
and	1
knowest	1
what	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
him;	1
but	1
his	1
hoar	1
head	1
bring	1
thou	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
with	1
blood.	1
	1
2:10	1
So	1
David	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
David	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel	1
were	1
forty	1
years:	1
seven	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:12	1
Then	1
sat	1
Solomon	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
established	1
greatly.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
Adonijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Haggith	1
came	1
to	1
Bathsheba	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Comest	1
thou	1
peaceably?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Peaceably.	1
	1
2:14	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
was	1
mine,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Israel	1
set	1
their	1
faces	1
on	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
reign:	1
howbeit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
is	1
turned	1
about,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
my	1
brother's:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
ask	1
one	1
petition	1
of	1
thee,	1
deny	1
me	1
not.	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
on.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
Solomon	1
the	1
king,	1
(for	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
thee	1
nay,)	1
that	1
he	1
give	1
me	1
Abishag	1
the	1
Shunammite	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
Bathsheba	1
said,	1
Well;	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
for	1
thee	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:19	1
Bathsheba	1
therefore	1
went	1
unto	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
Adonijah.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
caused	1
a	1
seat	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
mother;	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
desire	1
one	1
small	1
petition	1
of	1
thee;	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
say	1
me	1
not	1
nay.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Ask	1
on,	1
my	1
mother:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
thee	1
nay.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Let	1
Abishag	1
the	1
Shunammite	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
Adonijah	1
thy	1
brother	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
And	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
ask	1
Abishag	1
the	1
Shunammite	1
for	1
Adonijah?	1
ask	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
kingdom	1
also;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mine	1
elder	1
brother;	1
even	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
for	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah.	1
	1
2:23	1
Then	1
king	1
Solomon	1
sware	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
Adonijah	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
this	1
word	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
life.	1
	1
2:24	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
which	1
hath	1
established	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
an	1
house,	1
as	1
he	1
promised,	1
Adonijah	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
sent	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
unto	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priest	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
Get	1
thee	1
to	1
Anathoth,	1
unto	1
thine	1
own	1
fields;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
of	1
death:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
death,	1
because	1
thou	1
barest	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
before	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
afflicted	1
in	1
all	1
wherein	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
afflicted.	1
	1
2:27	1
So	1
Solomon	1
thrust	1
out	1
Abiathar	1
from	1
being	1
priest	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eli	1
in	1
Shiloh.	1
	1
2:28	1
Then	1
tidings	1
came	1
to	1
Joab:	1
for	1
Joab	1
had	1
turned	1
after	1
Adonijah,	1
though	1
he	1
turned	1
not	1
after	1
Absalom.	1
And	1
Joab	1
fled	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
caught	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
2:29	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
king	1
Solomon	1
that	1
Joab	1
was	1
fled	1
unto	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
altar.	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
sent	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
fall	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Come	1
forth.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
die	1
here.	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
brought	1
the	1
king	1
word	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
said	1
Joab,	1
and	1
thus	1
he	1
answered	1
me.	1
	1
2:31	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Do	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
bury	1
him;	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood,	1
which	1
Joab	1
shed,	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return	1
his	1
blood	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head,	1
who	1
fell	1
upon	1
two	1
men	1
more	1
righteous	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
he,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
my	1
father	1
David	1
not	1
knowing	1
thereof,	1
to	1
wit,	1
Abner	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ner,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Amasa	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jether,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
2:33	1
Their	1
blood	1
shall	1
therefore	1
return	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joab,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
upon	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
seed,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
peace	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:34	1
So	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:35	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
over	1
the	1
host:	1
and	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
Abiathar.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
Shimei,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Build	1
thee	1
an	1
house	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
go	1
not	1
forth	1
thence	1
any	1
whither.	1
	1
2:37	1
For	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
thou	1
goest	1
out,	1
and	1
passest	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die:	1
thy	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
thine	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
Shimei	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
The	1
saying	1
is	1
good:	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
said,	1
so	1
will	1
thy	1
servant	1
do.	1
And	1
Shimei	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
years,	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Shimei	1
ran	1
away	1
unto	1
Achish	1
son	1
of	1
Maachah	1
king	1
of	1
Gath.	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
Shimei,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
servants	1
be	1
in	1
Gath.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
Shimei	1
arose,	1
and	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Gath	1
to	1
Achish	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
Shimei	1
went,	1
and	1
brought	1
his	1
servants	1
from	1
Gath.	1
	1
2:41	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
Solomon	1
that	1
Shimei	1
had	1
gone	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Gath,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
Shimei,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
protested	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
for	1
a	1
certain,	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
thou	1
goest	1
out,	1
and	1
walkest	1
abroad	1
any	1
whither,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die?	1
and	1
thou	1
saidst	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
2:43	1
Why	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
charged	1
thee	1
with?	1
	1
2:44	1
The	1
king	1
said	1
moreover	1
to	1
Shimei,	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
the	1
wickedness	1
which	1
thine	1
heart	1
is	1
privy	1
to,	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
to	1
David	1
my	1
father:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
return	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
upon	1
thine	1
own	1
head;	1
2:45	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed,	1
and	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
David	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:46	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada;	1
which	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
And	1
the	1
kingdom	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
Solomon	1
made	1
affinity	1
with	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
took	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
building	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
3:2	1
Only	1
the	1
people	1
sacrificed	1
in	1
high	1
places,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
house	1
built	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
Solomon	1
loved	1
the	1
LORD,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
only	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
to	1
Gibeon	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
there;	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
high	1
place:	1
a	1
thousand	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
did	1
Solomon	1
offer	1
upon	1
that	1
altar.	1
	1
3:5	1
In	1
Gibeon	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
to	1
Solomon	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
by	1
night:	1
and	1
God	1
said,	1
Ask	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
Solomon	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
great	1
mercy,	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
truth,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
in	1
uprightness	1
of	1
heart	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
for	1
him	1
this	1
great	1
kindness,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
son	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
thy	1
servant	1
king	1
instead	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
child:	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
or	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
thy	1
servant	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
a	1
great	1
people,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered	1
nor	1
counted	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
3:9	1
Give	1
therefore	1
thy	1
servant	1
an	1
understanding	1
heart	1
to	1
judge	1
thy	1
people,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
discern	1
between	1
good	1
and	1
bad:	1
for	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
this	1
thy	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
people?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
speech	1
pleased	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
Solomon	1
had	1
asked	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
asked	1
this	1
thing,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
asked	1
for	1
thyself	1
long	1
life;	1
neither	1
hast	1
asked	1
riches	1
for	1
thyself,	1
nor	1
hast	1
asked	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies;	1
but	1
hast	1
asked	1
for	1
thyself	1
understanding	1
to	1
discern	1
judgment;	1
3:12	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
words:	1
lo,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
an	1
understanding	1
heart;	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
thee	1
before	1
thee,	1
neither	1
after	1
thee	1
shall	1
any	1
arise	1
like	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
given	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
asked,	1
both	1
riches,	1
and	1
honour:	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
among	1
the	1
kings	1
like	1
unto	1
thee	1
all	1
thy	1
days.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
commandments,	1
as	1
thy	1
father	1
David	1
did	1
walk,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
lengthen	1
thy	1
days.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Solomon	1
awoke;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dream.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offered	1
up	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
offered	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
two	1
women,	1
that	1
were	1
harlots,	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
woman	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
and	1
this	1
woman	1
dwell	1
in	1
one	1
house;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
delivered,	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
delivered	1
also:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
together;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
stranger	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
save	1
we	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
this	1
woman's	1
child	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
because	1
she	1
overlaid	1
it.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
she	1
arose	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
took	1
my	1
son	1
from	1
beside	1
me,	1
while	1
thine	1
handmaid	1
slept,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
dead	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
bosom.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
rose	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
child	1
suck,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
dead:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
considered	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
bear.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
woman	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
the	1
living	1
is	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
is	1
thy	1
son.	1
And	1
this	1
said,	1
No;	1
but	1
the	1
dead	1
is	1
thy	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
is	1
my	1
son.	1
Thus	1
they	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:23	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king,	1
The	1
one	1
saith,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
son	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
thy	1
son	1
is	1
the	1
dead:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
saith,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
thy	1
son	1
is	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Bring	1
me	1
a	1
sword.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
a	1
sword	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Divide	1
the	1
living	1
child	1
in	1
two,	1
and	1
give	1
half	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
half	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
3:26	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
woman	1
whose	1
the	1
living	1
child	1
was	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
for	1
her	1
bowels	1
yearned	1
upon	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
she	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
living	1
child,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
slay	1
it.	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
said,	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
neither	1
mine	1
nor	1
thine,	1
but	1
divide	1
it.	1
	1
3:27	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Give	1
her	1
the	1
living	1
child,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
slay	1
it:	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:28	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
judgment	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
judged;	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
him,	1
to	1
do	1
judgment.	1
	1
4:1	1
So	1
king	1
Solomon	1
was	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
princes	1
which	1
he	1
had;	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
4:3	1
Elihoreph	1
and	1
Ahiah,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shisha,	1
scribes;	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud,	1
the	1
recorder.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
host:	1
and	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
were	1
the	1
priests:	1
4:5	1
And	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nathan	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
officers:	1
and	1
Zabud	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nathan	1
was	1
principal	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
friend:	1
4:6	1
And	1
Ahishar	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household:	1
and	1
Adoniram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abda	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
tribute.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
twelve	1
officers	1
over	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
provided	1
victuals	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
household:	1
each	1
man	1
his	1
month	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
made	1
provision.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
their	1
names:	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim:	1
4:9	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Dekar,	1
in	1
Makaz,	1
and	1
in	1
Shaalbim,	1
and	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
Elonbethhanan:	1
4:10	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Hesed,	1
in	1
Aruboth;	1
to	1
him	1
pertained	1
Sochoh,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hepher:	1
4:11	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Abinadab,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Dor;	1
which	1
had	1
Taphath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Solomon	1
to	1
wife:	1
4:12	1
Baana	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud;	1
to	1
him	1
pertained	1
Taanach	1
and	1
Megiddo,	1
and	1
all	1
Bethshean,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
Zartanah	1
beneath	1
Jezreel,	1
from	1
Bethshean	1
to	1
Abelmeholah,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
beyond	1
Jokneam:	1
4:13	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Geber,	1
in	1
Ramothgilead;	1
to	1
him	1
pertained	1
the	1
towns	1
of	1
Jair	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Gilead;	1
to	1
him	1
also	1
pertained	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Argob,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
threescore	1
great	1
cities	1
with	1
walls	1
and	1
brasen	1
bars:	1
4:14	1
Ahinadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
had	1
Mahanaim:	1
4:15	1
Ahimaaz	1
was	1
in	1
Naphtali;	1
he	1
also	1
took	1
Basmath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Solomon	1
to	1
wife:	1
4:16	1
Baanah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hushai	1
was	1
in	1
Asher	1
and	1
in	1
Aloth:	1
4:17	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Paruah,	1
in	1
Issachar:	1
4:18	1
Shimei	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elah,	1
in	1
Benjamin:	1
4:19	1
Geber	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Sihon	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
officer	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:20	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel	1
were	1
many,	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
multitude,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
making	1
merry.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
Solomon	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
kingdoms	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
they	1
brought	1
presents,	1
and	1
served	1
Solomon	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
Solomon's	1
provision	1
for	1
one	1
day	1
was	1
thirty	1
measures	1
of	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
threescore	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
4:23	1
Ten	1
fat	1
oxen,	1
and	1
twenty	1
oxen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pastures,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
beside	1
harts,	1
and	1
roebucks,	1
and	1
fallowdeer,	1
and	1
fatted	1
fowl.	1
	1
4:24	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
dominion	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
from	1
Tiphsah	1
even	1
to	1
Azzah,	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
peace	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
round	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
safely,	1
every	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
fig	1
tree,	1
from	1
Dan	1
even	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
forty	1
thousand	1
stalls	1
of	1
horses	1
for	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
horsemen.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
those	1
officers	1
provided	1
victual	1
for	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
king	1
Solomon's	1
table,	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
month:	1
they	1
lacked	1
nothing.	1
	1
4:28	1
Barley	1
also	1
and	1
straw	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
dromedaries	1
brought	1
they	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
officers	1
were,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
charge.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
God	1
gave	1
Solomon	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding	1
exceeding	1
much,	1
and	1
largeness	1
of	1
heart,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shore.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
Solomon's	1
wisdom	1
excelled	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
country,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
4:31	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
wiser	1
than	1
all	1
men;	1
than	1
Ethan	1
the	1
Ezrahite,	1
and	1
Heman,	1
and	1
Chalcol,	1
and	1
Darda,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mahol:	1
and	1
his	1
fame	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
nations	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
three	1
thousand	1
proverbs:	1
and	1
his	1
songs	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
five.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
trees,	1
from	1
the	1
cedar	1
tree	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Lebanon	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
hyssop	1
that	1
springeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wall:	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
fowl,	1
and	1
of	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
of	1
fishes.	1
	1
4:34	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
from	1
all	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
wisdom.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
Hiram	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
unto	1
Solomon;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
anointed	1
him	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
father:	1
for	1
Hiram	1
was	1
ever	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
Solomon	1
sent	1
to	1
Hiram,	1
saying,	1
5:3	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
how	1
that	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
could	1
not	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
wars	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
until	1
the	1
LORD	1
put	1
them	1
under	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
rest	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
adversary	1
nor	1
evil	1
occurrent.	1
	1
5:5	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
purpose	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
son,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
upon	1
thy	1
throne	1
in	1
thy	1
room,	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
5:6	1
Now	1
therefore	1
command	1
thou	1
that	1
they	1
hew	1
me	1
cedar	1
trees	1
out	1
of	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
servants:	1
and	1
unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
hire	1
for	1
thy	1
servants	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
appoint:	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
among	1
us	1
any	1
that	1
can	1
skill	1
to	1
hew	1
timber	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Sidonians.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Hiram	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
that	1
he	1
rejoiced	1
greatly,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
this	1
day,	1
which	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
David	1
a	1
wise	1
son	1
over	1
this	1
great	1
people.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
Hiram	1
sent	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
sentest	1
to	1
me	1
for:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
thy	1
desire	1
concerning	1
timber	1
of	1
cedar,	1
and	1
concerning	1
timber	1
of	1
fir.	1
	1
5:9	1
My	1
servants	1
shall	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
from	1
Lebanon	1
unto	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
convey	1
them	1
by	1
sea	1
in	1
floats	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
appoint	1
me,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
discharged	1
there,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
receive	1
them:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
accomplish	1
my	1
desire,	1
in	1
giving	1
food	1
for	1
my	1
household.	1
	1
5:10	1
So	1
Hiram	1
gave	1
Solomon	1
cedar	1
trees	1
and	1
fir	1
trees	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
desire.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
Solomon	1
gave	1
Hiram	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat	1
for	1
food	1
to	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
twenty	1
measures	1
of	1
pure	1
oil:	1
thus	1
gave	1
Solomon	1
to	1
Hiram	1
year	1
by	1
year.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
Solomon	1
wisdom,	1
as	1
he	1
promised	1
him:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
peace	1
between	1
Hiram	1
and	1
Solomon;	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
made	1
a	1
league	1
together.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
raised	1
a	1
levy	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Israel;	1
and	1
the	1
levy	1
was	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Lebanon,	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
month	1
by	1
courses:	1
a	1
month	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
two	1
months	1
at	1
home:	1
and	1
Adoniram	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
levy.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
that	1
bare	1
burdens,	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
hewers	1
in	1
the	1
mountains;	1
5:16	1
Beside	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
Solomon's	1
officers	1
which	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
work,	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
hundred,	1
which	1
ruled	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
great	1
stones,	1
costly	1
stones,	1
and	1
hewed	1
stones,	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
Solomon's	1
builders	1
and	1
Hiram's	1
builders	1
did	1
hew	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
stonesquarers:	1
so	1
they	1
prepared	1
timber	1
and	1
stones	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
eightieth	1
year	1
after	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Solomon's	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Zif,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
king	1
Solomon	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
thirty	1
cubits.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
the	1
porch	1
before	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
ten	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
before	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
made	1
windows	1
of	1
narrow	1
lights.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
built	1
chambers	1
round	1
about,	1
against	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
oracle:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
chambers	1
round	1
about:	1
6:6	1
The	1
nethermost	1
chamber	1
was	1
five	1
cubits	1
broad,	1
and	1
the	1
middle	1
was	1
six	1
cubits	1
broad,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
was	1
seven	1
cubits	1
broad:	1
for	1
without	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
made	1
narrowed	1
rests	1
round	1
about,	1
that	1
the	1
beams	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
fastened	1
in	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
house,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
building,	1
was	1
built	1
of	1
stone	1
made	1
ready	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
brought	1
thither:	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
hammer	1
nor	1
axe	1
nor	1
any	1
tool	1
of	1
iron	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
building.	1
	1
6:8	1
The	1
door	1
for	1
the	1
middle	1
chamber	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
winding	1
stairs	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
chamber,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
into	1
the	1
third.	1
	1
6:9	1
So	1
he	1
built	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
finished	1
it;	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
beams	1
and	1
boards	1
of	1
cedar.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
built	1
chambers	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
house,	1
five	1
cubits	1
high:	1
and	1
they	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
timber	1
of	1
cedar.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
saying,	1
6:12	1
Concerning	1
this	1
house	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
building,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
statutes,	1
and	1
execute	1
my	1
judgments,	1
and	1
keep	1
all	1
my	1
commandments	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
them;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
perform	1
my	1
word	1
with	1
thee,	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
David	1
thy	1
father:	1
6:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:14	1
So	1
Solomon	1
built	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
finished	1
it.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
within	1
with	1
boards	1
of	1
cedar,	1
both	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling:	1
and	1
he	1
covered	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
with	1
wood,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
planks	1
of	1
fir.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
both	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
with	1
boards	1
of	1
cedar:	1
he	1
even	1
built	1
them	1
for	1
it	1
within,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
oracle,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
the	1
house,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
temple	1
before	1
it,	1
was	1
forty	1
cubits	1
long.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
cedar	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
within	1
was	1
carved	1
with	1
knops	1
and	1
open	1
flowers:	1
all	1
was	1
cedar;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
stone	1
seen.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
oracle	1
he	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
within,	1
to	1
set	1
there	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
the	1
oracle	1
in	1
the	1
forepart	1
was	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
in	1
length,	1
and	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
in	1
breadth,	1
and	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
thereof:	1
and	1
he	1
overlaid	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold;	1
and	1
so	1
covered	1
the	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
cedar.	1
	1
6:21	1
So	1
Solomon	1
overlaid	1
the	1
house	1
within	1
with	1
pure	1
gold:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
partition	1
by	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
gold	1
before	1
the	1
oracle;	1
and	1
he	1
overlaid	1
it	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
he	1
overlaid	1
with	1
gold,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
the	1
house:	1
also	1
the	1
whole	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
oracle	1
he	1
overlaid	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
within	1
the	1
oracle	1
he	1
made	1
two	1
cherubims	1
of	1
olive	1
tree,	1
each	1
ten	1
cubits	1
high.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
five	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
cherub,	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
the	1
other	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
cherub:	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
wing	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
ten	1
cubits.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
cherub	1
was	1
ten	1
cubits:	1
both	1
the	1
cherubims	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
measure	1
and	1
one	1
size.	1
	1
6:26	1
The	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
cherub	1
was	1
ten	1
cubits,	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
cherub.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
cherubims	1
within	1
the	1
inner	1
house:	1
and	1
they	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
touched	1
the	1
one	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
cherub	1
touched	1
the	1
other	1
wall;	1
and	1
their	1
wings	1
touched	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
he	1
overlaid	1
the	1
cherubims	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
he	1
carved	1
all	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
carved	1
figures	1
of	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees	1
and	1
open	1
flowers,	1
within	1
and	1
without.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
the	1
floors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
overlaid	1
with	1
gold,	1
within	1
and	1
without.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
oracle	1
he	1
made	1
doors	1
of	1
olive	1
tree:	1
the	1
lintel	1
and	1
side	1
posts	1
were	1
a	1
fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
6:32	1
The	1
two	1
doors	1
also	1
were	1
of	1
olive	1
tree;	1
and	1
he	1
carved	1
upon	1
them	1
carvings	1
of	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees	1
and	1
open	1
flowers,	1
and	1
overlaid	1
them	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
spread	1
gold	1
upon	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
palm	1
trees.	1
	1
6:33	1
So	1
also	1
made	1
he	1
for	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
posts	1
of	1
olive	1
tree,	1
a	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
doors	1
were	1
of	1
fir	1
tree:	1
the	1
two	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
door	1
were	1
folding,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
door	1
were	1
folding.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
he	1
carved	1
thereon	1
cherubims	1
and	1
palm	1
trees	1
and	1
open	1
flowers:	1
and	1
covered	1
them	1
with	1
gold	1
fitted	1
upon	1
the	1
carved	1
work.	1
	1
6:36	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
with	1
three	1
rows	1
of	1
hewed	1
stone,	1
and	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
cedar	1
beams.	1
	1
6:37	1
In	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
was	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
laid,	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Zif:	1
6:38	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year,	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Bul,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
was	1
the	1
house	1
finished	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
thereof,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
it.	1
So	1
was	1
he	1
seven	1
years	1
in	1
building	1
it.	1
	1
7:1	1
But	1
Solomon	1
was	1
building	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
thirteen	1
years,	1
and	1
he	1
finished	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:2	1
He	1
built	1
also	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Lebanon;	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
fifty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
thirty	1
cubits,	1
upon	1
four	1
rows	1
of	1
cedar	1
pillars,	1
with	1
cedar	1
beams	1
upon	1
the	1
pillars.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
cedar	1
above	1
upon	1
the	1
beams,	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
forty	1
five	1
pillars,	1
fifteen	1
in	1
a	1
row.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
windows	1
in	1
three	1
rows,	1
and	1
light	1
was	1
against	1
light	1
in	1
three	1
ranks.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
and	1
posts	1
were	1
square,	1
with	1
the	1
windows:	1
and	1
light	1
was	1
against	1
light	1
in	1
three	1
ranks.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
porch	1
of	1
pillars;	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
was	1
fifty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
thirty	1
cubits:	1
and	1
the	1
porch	1
was	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
pillars	1
and	1
the	1
thick	1
beam	1
were	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
7:7	1
Then	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
porch	1
for	1
the	1
throne	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
judge,	1
even	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
judgment:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
cedar	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
his	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
dwelt	1
had	1
another	1
court	1
within	1
the	1
porch,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
like	1
work.	1
Solomon	1
made	1
also	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
wife,	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
porch.	1
	1
7:9	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
of	1
costly	1
stones,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
hewed	1
stones,	1
sawed	1
with	1
saws,	1
within	1
and	1
without,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
unto	1
the	1
coping,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
toward	1
the	1
great	1
court.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
foundation	1
was	1
of	1
costly	1
stones,	1
even	1
great	1
stones,	1
stones	1
of	1
ten	1
cubits,	1
and	1
stones	1
of	1
eight	1
cubits.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
above	1
were	1
costly	1
stones,	1
after	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
hewed	1
stones,	1
and	1
cedars.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
court	1
round	1
about	1
was	1
with	1
three	1
rows	1
of	1
hewed	1
stones,	1
and	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
cedar	1
beams,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
inner	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
sent	1
and	1
fetched	1
Hiram	1
out	1
of	1
Tyre.	1
	1
7:14	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
widow's	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Tyre,	1
a	1
worker	1
in	1
brass:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
understanding,	1
and	1
cunning	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
works	1
in	1
brass.	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
wrought	1
all	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
7:15	1
For	1
he	1
cast	1
two	1
pillars	1
of	1
brass,	1
of	1
eighteen	1
cubits	1
high	1
apiece:	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
twelve	1
cubits	1
did	1
compass	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
about.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
two	1
chapiters	1
of	1
molten	1
brass,	1
to	1
set	1
upon	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
pillars:	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
chapiter	1
was	1
five	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
chapiter	1
was	1
five	1
cubits:	1
7:17	1
And	1
nets	1
of	1
checker	1
work,	1
and	1
wreaths	1
of	1
chain	1
work,	1
for	1
the	1
chapiters	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pillars;	1
seven	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
chapiter,	1
and	1
seven	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
chapiter.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
pillars,	1
and	1
two	1
rows	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
one	1
network,	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
chapiters	1
that	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
top,	1
with	1
pomegranates:	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
he	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
chapiter.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
the	1
chapiters	1
that	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pillars	1
were	1
of	1
lily	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
porch,	1
four	1
cubits.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
the	1
chapiters	1
upon	1
the	1
two	1
pillars	1
had	1
pomegranates	1
also	1
above,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
belly	1
which	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
network:	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranates	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
in	1
rows	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
chapiter.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
pillars	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
right	1
pillar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Jachin:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
left	1
pillar,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
thereof	1
Boaz.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pillars	1
was	1
lily	1
work:	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
pillars	1
finished.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
molten	1
sea,	1
ten	1
cubits	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
brim	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
it	1
was	1
round	1
all	1
about,	1
and	1
his	1
height	1
was	1
five	1
cubits:	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
thirty	1
cubits	1
did	1
compass	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
under	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
it	1
round	1
about	1
there	1
were	1
knops	1
compassing	1
it,	1
ten	1
in	1
a	1
cubit,	1
compassing	1
the	1
sea	1
round	1
about:	1
the	1
knops	1
were	1
cast	1
in	1
two	1
rows,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
cast.	1
	1
7:25	1
It	1
stood	1
upon	1
twelve	1
oxen,	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
east:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
set	1
above	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
hinder	1
parts	1
were	1
inward.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
hand	1
breadth	1
thick,	1
and	1
the	1
brim	1
thereof	1
was	1
wrought	1
like	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
a	1
cup,	1
with	1
flowers	1
of	1
lilies:	1
it	1
contained	1
two	1
thousand	1
baths.	1
	1
7:27	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
ten	1
bases	1
of	1
brass;	1
four	1
cubits	1
was	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
one	1
base,	1
and	1
four	1
cubits	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
three	1
cubits	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
bases	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
manner:	1
they	1
had	1
borders,	1
and	1
the	1
borders	1
were	1
between	1
the	1
ledges:	1
7:29	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
that	1
were	1
between	1
the	1
ledges	1
were	1
lions,	1
oxen,	1
and	1
cherubims:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
ledges	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
base	1
above:	1
and	1
beneath	1
the	1
lions	1
and	1
oxen	1
were	1
certain	1
additions	1
made	1
of	1
thin	1
work.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
every	1
base	1
had	1
four	1
brasen	1
wheels,	1
and	1
plates	1
of	1
brass:	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
thereof	1
had	1
undersetters:	1
under	1
the	1
laver	1
were	1
undersetters	1
molten,	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
every	1
addition.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
it	1
within	1
the	1
chapiter	1
and	1
above	1
was	1
a	1
cubit:	1
but	1
the	1
mouth	1
thereof	1
was	1
round	1
after	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
base,	1
a	1
cubit	1
and	1
an	1
half:	1
and	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
gravings	1
with	1
their	1
borders,	1
foursquare,	1
not	1
round.	1
	1
7:32	1
And	1
under	1
the	1
borders	1
were	1
four	1
wheels;	1
and	1
the	1
axletrees	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
were	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
base:	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
a	1
wheel	1
was	1
a	1
cubit	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
cubit.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
chariot	1
wheel:	1
their	1
axletrees,	1
and	1
their	1
naves,	1
and	1
their	1
felloes,	1
and	1
their	1
spokes,	1
were	1
all	1
molten.	1
	1
7:34	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
undersetters	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
one	1
base:	1
and	1
the	1
undersetters	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
base	1
itself.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
base	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
round	1
compass	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
cubit	1
high:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
base	1
the	1
ledges	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
borders	1
thereof	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
7:36	1
For	1
on	1
the	1
plates	1
of	1
the	1
ledges	1
thereof,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
thereof,	1
he	1
graved	1
cherubims,	1
lions,	1
and	1
palm	1
trees,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
every	1
one,	1
and	1
additions	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
7:37	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
ten	1
bases:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
one	1
casting,	1
one	1
measure,	1
and	1
one	1
size.	1
	1
7:38	1
Then	1
made	1
he	1
ten	1
lavers	1
of	1
brass:	1
one	1
laver	1
contained	1
forty	1
baths:	1
and	1
every	1
laver	1
was	1
four	1
cubits:	1
and	1
upon	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ten	1
bases	1
one	1
laver.	1
	1
7:39	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
five	1
bases	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
eastward	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
7:40	1
And	1
Hiram	1
made	1
the	1
lavers,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
basons.	1
So	1
Hiram	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
doing	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
king	1
Solomon	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
7:41	1
The	1
two	1
pillars,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
bowls	1
of	1
the	1
chapiters	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
pillars;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
networks,	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
two	1
bowls	1
of	1
the	1
chapiters	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pillars;	1
7:42	1
And	1
four	1
hundred	1
pomegranates	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
networks,	1
even	1
two	1
rows	1
of	1
pomegranates	1
for	1
one	1
network,	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
two	1
bowls	1
of	1
the	1
chapiters	1
that	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
pillars;	1
7:43	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
bases,	1
and	1
ten	1
lavers	1
on	1
the	1
bases;	1
7:44	1
And	1
one	1
sea,	1
and	1
twelve	1
oxen	1
under	1
the	1
sea;	1
7:45	1
And	1
the	1
pots,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
basons:	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
vessels,	1
which	1
Hiram	1
made	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
were	1
of	1
bright	1
brass.	1
	1
7:46	1
In	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
cast	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
clay	1
ground	1
between	1
Succoth	1
and	1
Zarthan.	1
	1
7:47	1
And	1
Solomon	1
left	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
unweighed,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
many:	1
neither	1
was	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
brass	1
found	1
out.	1
	1
7:48	1
And	1
Solomon	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
pertained	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
gold,	1
whereupon	1
the	1
shewbread	1
was,	1
7:49	1
And	1
the	1
candlesticks	1
of	1
pure	1
gold,	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
and	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
before	1
the	1
oracle,	1
with	1
the	1
flowers,	1
and	1
the	1
lamps,	1
and	1
the	1
tongs	1
of	1
gold,	1
7:50	1
And	1
the	1
bowls,	1
and	1
the	1
snuffers,	1
and	1
the	1
basons,	1
and	1
the	1
spoons,	1
and	1
the	1
censers	1
of	1
pure	1
gold;	1
and	1
the	1
hinges	1
of	1
gold,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
house,	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
wit,	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
7:51	1
So	1
was	1
ended	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
king	1
Solomon	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Solomon	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
David	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
dedicated;	1
even	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels,	1
did	1
he	1
put	1
among	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:1	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
assembled	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
tribes,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
king	1
Solomon	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
Zion.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
unto	1
king	1
Solomon	1
at	1
the	1
feast	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Ethanim,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
even	1
those	1
did	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
bring	1
up.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
were	1
assembled	1
unto	1
him,	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
ark,	1
sacrificing	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
told	1
nor	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
his	1
place,	1
into	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place,	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
the	1
cherubims	1
spread	1
forth	1
their	1
two	1
wings	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
cherubims	1
covered	1
the	1
ark	1
and	1
the	1
staves	1
thereof	1
above.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
out	1
the	1
staves,	1
that	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
staves	1
were	1
seen	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
before	1
the	1
oracle,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
seen	1
without:	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
are	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:9	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
save	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
which	1
Moses	1
put	1
there	1
at	1
Horeb,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
cloud	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
8:11	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
to	1
minister	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cloud:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Solomon,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
darkness.	1
	1
8:13	1
I	1
have	1
surely	1
built	1
thee	1
an	1
house	1
to	1
dwell	1
in,	1
a	1
settled	1
place	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
abide	1
in	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
about,	1
and	1
blessed	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel:	1
(and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
stood;)	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
spake	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
hath	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
fulfilled	1
it,	1
saying,	1
8:16	1
Since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
I	1
chose	1
no	1
city	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
therein;	1
but	1
I	1
chose	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
Whereas	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
thou	1
didst	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart.	1
	1
8:19	1
Nevertheless	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
thy	1
son	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
loins,	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
unto	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
performed	1
his	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
risen	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
promised,	1
and	1
have	1
built	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
there	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
ark,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
when	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
Solomon	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
toward	1
heaven:	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
like	1
thee,	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
or	1
on	1
earth	1
beneath,	1
who	1
keepest	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
with	1
thy	1
servants	1
that	1
walk	1
before	1
thee	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart:	1
8:24	1
Who	1
hast	1
kept	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
thou	1
promisedst	1
him:	1
thou	1
spakest	1
also	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
hast	1
fulfilled	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
hand,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:25	1
Therefore	1
now,	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
keep	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
thou	1
promisedst	1
him,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
sight	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel;	1
so	1
that	1
thy	1
children	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
their	1
way,	1
that	1
they	1
walk	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
walked	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
thy	1
word,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
verified,	1
which	1
thou	1
spakest	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
8:27	1
But	1
will	1
God	1
indeed	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
behold,	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
heaven	1
of	1
heavens	1
cannot	1
contain	1
thee;	1
how	1
much	1
less	1
this	1
house	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
builded?	1
	1
8:28	1
Yet	1
have	1
thou	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
supplication,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
cry	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prayer,	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
prayeth	1
before	1
thee	1
to	1
day:	1
8:29	1
That	1
thine	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
open	1
toward	1
this	1
house	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
even	1
toward	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
My	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
there:	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
prayer	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
shall	1
make	1
toward	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
hearken	1
thou	1
to	1
the	1
supplication	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
pray	1
toward	1
this	1
place:	1
and	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place:	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hearest,	1
forgive.	1
	1
8:31	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
trespass	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
swear,	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
come	1
before	1
thine	1
altar	1
in	1
this	1
house:	1
8:32	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
do,	1
and	1
judge	1
thy	1
servants,	1
condemning	1
the	1
wicked,	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
way	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
and	1
justifying	1
the	1
righteous,	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:33	1
When	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
be	1
smitten	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
enemy,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
shall	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
confess	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
pray,	1
and	1
make	1
supplication	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
house:	1
8:34	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
forgive	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
8:35	1
When	1
heaven	1
is	1
shut	1
up,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rain,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee;	1
if	1
they	1
pray	1
toward	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
confess	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
sin,	1
when	1
thou	1
afflictest	1
them:	1
8:36	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
forgive	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
that	1
thou	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
good	1
way	1
wherein	1
they	1
should	1
walk,	1
and	1
give	1
rain	1
upon	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
to	1
thy	1
people	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance.	1
	1
8:37	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
famine,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
pestilence,	1
blasting,	1
mildew,	1
locust,	1
or	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
caterpiller;	1
if	1
their	1
enemy	1
besiege	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
cities;	1
whatsoever	1
plague,	1
whatsoever	1
sickness	1
there	1
be;	1
8:38	1
What	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
soever	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
any	1
man,	1
or	1
by	1
all	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
which	1
shall	1
know	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
and	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
toward	1
this	1
house:	1
8:39	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
forgive,	1
and	1
do,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways,	1
whose	1
heart	1
thou	1
knowest;	1
(for	1
thou,	1
even	1
thou	1
only,	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men;)	1
8:40	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
fear	1
thee	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
they	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
8:41	1
Moreover	1
concerning	1
a	1
stranger,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
but	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
for	1
thy	1
name's	1
sake;	1
8:42	1
(For	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
thy	1
great	1
name,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
strong	1
hand,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm;)	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
pray	1
toward	1
this	1
house;	1
8:43	1
Hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
stranger	1
calleth	1
to	1
thee	1
for:	1
that	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
thy	1
name,	1
to	1
fear	1
thee,	1
as	1
do	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
builded,	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
8:44	1
If	1
thy	1
people	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle	1
against	1
their	1
enemy,	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
send	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
pray	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
toward	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
thy	1
name:	1
8:45	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
in	1
heaven	1
their	1
prayer	1
and	1
their	1
supplication,	1
and	1
maintain	1
their	1
cause.	1
	1
8:46	1
If	1
they	1
sin	1
against	1
thee,	1
(for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
sinneth	1
not,)	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
enemy,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
carry	1
them	1
away	1
captives	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
far	1
or	1
near;	1
8:47	1
Yet	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
bethink	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
captives,	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
make	1
supplication	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
carried	1
them	1
captives,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
perversely,	1
we	1
have	1
committed	1
wickedness;	1
8:48	1
And	1
so	1
return	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
soul,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
which	1
led	1
them	1
away	1
captive,	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
thee	1
toward	1
their	1
land,	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers,	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
thy	1
name:	1
8:49	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
their	1
prayer	1
and	1
their	1
supplication	1
in	1
heaven	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
maintain	1
their	1
cause,	1
8:50	1
And	1
forgive	1
thy	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
transgressions	1
wherein	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
compassion	1
before	1
them	1
who	1
carried	1
them	1
captive,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
them:	1
8:51	1
For	1
they	1
be	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
iron:	1
8:52	1
That	1
thine	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
open	1
unto	1
the	1
supplication	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
supplication	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
call	1
for	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
8:53	1
For	1
thou	1
didst	1
separate	1
them	1
from	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
be	1
thine	1
inheritance,	1
as	1
thou	1
spakest	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
thy	1
servant,	1
when	1
thou	1
broughtest	1
our	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
8:54	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
when	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
praying	1
all	1
this	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
kneeling	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
spread	1
up	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:55	1
And	1
he	1
stood,	1
and	1
blessed	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
8:56	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
hath	1
given	1
rest	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
Israel,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
promised:	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
failed	1
one	1
word	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
good	1
promise,	1
which	1
he	1
promised	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
8:57	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
us,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
our	1
fathers:	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
leave	1
us,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
us:	1
8:58	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
incline	1
our	1
hearts	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
judgments,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
8:59	1
And	1
let	1
these	1
my	1
words,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
be	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
that	1
he	1
maintain	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Israel	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
as	1
the	1
matter	1
shall	1
require:	1
8:60	1
That	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
else.	1
	1
8:61	1
Let	1
your	1
heart	1
therefore	1
be	1
perfect	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:62	1
And	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:63	1
And	1
Solomon	1
offered	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
oxen,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
sheep.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
dedicated	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:64	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
hallow	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
there	1
he	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings:	1
because	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
too	1
little	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings.	1
	1
8:65	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
Solomon	1
held	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
a	1
great	1
congregation,	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hamath	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
seven	1
days	1
and	1
seven	1
days,	1
even	1
fourteen	1
days.	1
	1
8:66	1
On	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
people	1
away:	1
and	1
they	1
blessed	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
their	1
tents	1
joyful	1
and	1
glad	1
of	1
heart	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
goodness	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
David	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
for	1
Israel	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Solomon	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
Solomon's	1
desire	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
do,	1
9:2	1
That	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
to	1
Solomon	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
at	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayer	1
and	1
thy	1
supplication,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
before	1
me:	1
I	1
have	1
hallowed	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
built,	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
there	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
and	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
perpetually.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
David	1
thy	1
father	1
walked,	1
in	1
integrity	1
of	1
heart,	1
and	1
in	1
uprightness,	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
and	1
wilt	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
judgments:	1
9:5	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever,	1
as	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
at	1
all	1
turn	1
from	1
following	1
me,	1
ye	1
or	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
statutes	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
but	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worship	1
them:	1
9:7	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
and	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
hallowed	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight;	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
proverb	1
and	1
a	1
byword	1
among	1
all	1
people:	1
9:8	1
And	1
at	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
high,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
by	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
astonished,	1
and	1
shall	1
hiss;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Why	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
thus	1
unto	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
house?	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Because	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
who	1
brought	1
forth	1
their	1
fathers	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
hold	1
upon	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
and	1
served	1
them:	1
therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
all	1
this	1
evil.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
twenty	1
years,	1
when	1
Solomon	1
had	1
built	1
the	1
two	1
houses,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
9:11	1
(Now	1
Hiram	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
had	1
furnished	1
Solomon	1
with	1
cedar	1
trees	1
and	1
fir	1
trees,	1
and	1
with	1
gold,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
desire,)	1
that	1
then	1
king	1
Solomon	1
gave	1
Hiram	1
twenty	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
Hiram	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
Tyre	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
given	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
pleased	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
cities	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
my	1
brother?	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Cabul	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
Hiram	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
sixscore	1
talents	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
levy	1
which	1
king	1
Solomon	1
raised;	1
for	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
Millo,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
Hazor,	1
and	1
Megiddo,	1
and	1
Gezer.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
had	1
gone	1
up,	1
and	1
taken	1
Gezer,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
slain	1
the	1
Canaanites	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
given	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
unto	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Solomon's	1
wife.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
Solomon	1
built	1
Gezer,	1
and	1
Bethhoron	1
the	1
nether,	1
9:18	1
And	1
Baalath,	1
and	1
Tadmor	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
9:19	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
store	1
that	1
Solomon	1
had,	1
and	1
cities	1
for	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
cities	1
for	1
his	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
Solomon	1
desired	1
to	1
build	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
dominion.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
Hittites,	1
Perizzites,	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
Jebusites,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
9:21	1
Their	1
children	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
whom	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
also	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
utterly	1
to	1
destroy,	1
upon	1
those	1
did	1
Solomon	1
levy	1
a	1
tribute	1
of	1
bondservice	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
Solomon	1
make	1
no	1
bondmen:	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
his	1
captains,	1
and	1
rulers	1
of	1
his	1
chariots,	1
and	1
his	1
horsemen.	1
	1
9:23	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
that	1
were	1
over	1
Solomon's	1
work,	1
five	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty,	1
which	1
bare	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
9:24	1
But	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
her	1
house	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
built	1
for	1
her:	1
then	1
did	1
he	1
build	1
Millo.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
year	1
did	1
Solomon	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
which	1
he	1
built	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
burnt	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
So	1
he	1
finished	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
made	1
a	1
navy	1
of	1
ships	1
in	1
Eziongeber,	1
which	1
is	1
beside	1
Eloth,	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
Hiram	1
sent	1
in	1
the	1
navy	1
his	1
servants,	1
shipmen	1
that	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Ophir,	1
and	1
fetched	1
from	1
thence	1
gold,	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
talents,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Solomon	1
concerning	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
prove	1
him	1
with	1
hard	1
questions.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
train,	1
with	1
camels	1
that	1
bare	1
spices,	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
gold,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
she	1
communed	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
Solomon	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
questions:	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
hid	1
from	1
the	1
king,	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
had	1
seen	1
all	1
Solomon's	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
built,	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
meat	1
of	1
his	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
sitting	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
attendance	1
of	1
his	1
ministers,	1
and	1
their	1
apparel,	1
and	1
his	1
cupbearers,	1
and	1
his	1
ascent	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
spirit	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
true	1
report	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
land	1
of	1
thy	1
acts	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
wisdom.	1
	1
10:7	1
Howbeit	1
I	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
words,	1
until	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
had	1
seen	1
it:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
half	1
was	1
not	1
told	1
me:	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prosperity	1
exceedeth	1
the	1
fame	1
which	1
I	1
heard.	1
	1
10:8	1
Happy	1
are	1
thy	1
men,	1
happy	1
are	1
these	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
stand	1
continually	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
hear	1
thy	1
wisdom.	1
	1
10:9	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
delighted	1
in	1
thee,	1
to	1
set	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel:	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
loved	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever,	1
therefore	1
made	1
he	1
thee	1
king,	1
to	1
do	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
king	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
spices	1
very	1
great	1
store,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones:	1
there	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
such	1
abundance	1
of	1
spices	1
as	1
these	1
which	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
gave	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
the	1
navy	1
also	1
of	1
Hiram,	1
that	1
brought	1
gold	1
from	1
Ophir,	1
brought	1
in	1
from	1
Ophir	1
great	1
plenty	1
of	1
almug	1
trees,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
almug	1
trees	1
pillars	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
harps	1
also	1
and	1
psalteries	1
for	1
singers:	1
there	1
came	1
no	1
such	1
almug	1
trees,	1
nor	1
were	1
seen	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
all	1
her	1
desire,	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
asked,	1
beside	1
that	1
which	1
Solomon	1
gave	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
royal	1
bounty.	1
	1
So	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
country,	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
servants.	1
	1
10:14	1
Now	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Solomon	1
in	1
one	1
year	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
10:15	1
Beside	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
merchantmen,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
traffick	1
of	1
the	1
spice	1
merchants,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
made	1
two	1
hundred	1
targets	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold:	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold	1
went	1
to	1
one	1
target.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
three	1
hundred	1
shields	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold;	1
three	1
pound	1
of	1
gold	1
went	1
to	1
one	1
shield:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
10:18	1
Moreover	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
throne	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
overlaid	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
gold.	1
	1
10:19	1
The	1
throne	1
had	1
six	1
steps,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
was	1
round	1
behind:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
stays	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
on	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
seat,	1
and	1
two	1
lions	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
stays.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
twelve	1
lions	1
stood	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
six	1
steps:	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
like	1
made	1
in	1
any	1
kingdom.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
all	1
king	1
Solomon's	1
drinking	1
vessels	1
were	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
were	1
of	1
pure	1
gold;	1
none	1
were	1
of	1
silver:	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
accounted	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
10:22	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
at	1
sea	1
a	1
navy	1
of	1
Tharshish	1
with	1
the	1
navy	1
of	1
Hiram:	1
once	1
in	1
three	1
years	1
came	1
the	1
navy	1
of	1
Tharshish,	1
bringing	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
ivory,	1
and	1
apes,	1
and	1
peacocks.	1
	1
10:23	1
So	1
king	1
Solomon	1
exceeded	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
riches	1
and	1
for	1
wisdom.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
sought	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
present,	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
garments,	1
and	1
armour,	1
and	1
spices,	1
horses,	1
and	1
mules,	1
a	1
rate	1
year	1
by	1
year.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
Solomon	1
gathered	1
together	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
chariots,	1
and	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
whom	1
he	1
bestowed	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
for	1
chariots,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
silver	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
as	1
stones,	1
and	1
cedars	1
made	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sycomore	1
trees	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
vale,	1
for	1
abundance.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
horses	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
linen	1
yarn:	1
the	1
king's	1
merchants	1
received	1
the	1
linen	1
yarn	1
at	1
a	1
price.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
a	1
chariot	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
for	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
an	1
horse	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty:	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Syria,	1
did	1
they	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
by	1
their	1
means.	1
	1
11:1	1
But	1
king	1
Solomon	1
loved	1
many	1
strange	1
women,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
women	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
Ammonites,	1
Edomites,	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
Hittites:	1
11:2	1
Of	1
the	1
nations	1
concerning	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
them,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
surely	1
they	1
will	1
turn	1
away	1
your	1
heart	1
after	1
their	1
gods:	1
Solomon	1
clave	1
unto	1
these	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
seven	1
hundred	1
wives,	1
princesses,	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
concubines:	1
and	1
his	1
wives	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Solomon	1
was	1
old,	1
that	1
his	1
wives	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
heart	1
after	1
other	1
gods:	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
perfect	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
11:5	1
For	1
Solomon	1
went	1
after	1
Ashtoreth	1
the	1
goddess	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
after	1
Milcom	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
Solomon	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
fully	1
after	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
did	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
11:7	1
Then	1
did	1
Solomon	1
build	1
an	1
high	1
place	1
for	1
Chemosh,	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
Moab,	1
in	1
the	1
hill	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
for	1
Molech,	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
likewise	1
did	1
he	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
strange	1
wives,	1
which	1
burnt	1
incense	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
their	1
gods.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
angry	1
with	1
Solomon,	1
because	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
had	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
twice,	1
11:10	1
And	1
had	1
commanded	1
him	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
after	1
other	1
gods:	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded.	1
	1
11:11	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Solomon,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
covenant	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
rend	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
11:12	1
Notwithstanding	1
in	1
thy	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
David	1
thy	1
father's	1
sake:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
rend	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
11:13	1
Howbeit	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rend	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
will	1
give	1
one	1
tribe	1
to	1
thy	1
son	1
for	1
David	1
my	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
Jerusalem's	1
sake	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
an	1
adversary	1
unto	1
Solomon,	1
Hadad	1
the	1
Edomite:	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
seed	1
in	1
Edom.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
in	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Joab	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
bury	1
the	1
slain,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
smitten	1
every	1
male	1
in	1
Edom;	1
11:16	1
(For	1
six	1
months	1
did	1
Joab	1
remain	1
there	1
with	1
all	1
Israel,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
cut	1
off	1
every	1
male	1
in	1
Edom:)	1
11:17	1
That	1
Hadad	1
fled,	1
he	1
and	1
certain	1
Edomites	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
servants	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Egypt;	1
Hadad	1
being	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
child.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
they	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
Midian,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Paran:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
men	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Paran,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
unto	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
appointed	1
him	1
victuals,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
land.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
Hadad	1
found	1
great	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
wife	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Tahpenes	1
the	1
queen.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Tahpenes	1
bare	1
him	1
Genubath	1
his	1
son,	1
whom	1
Tahpenes	1
weaned	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
house:	1
and	1
Genubath	1
was	1
in	1
Pharaoh's	1
household	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
when	1
Hadad	1
heard	1
in	1
Egypt	1
that	1
David	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
that	1
Joab	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
was	1
dead,	1
Hadad	1
said	1
to	1
Pharaoh,	1
Let	1
me	1
depart,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
mine	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
Pharaoh	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
But	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
lacked	1
with	1
me,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
seekest	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
country?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Nothing:	1
howbeit	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
in	1
any	1
wise.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
God	1
stirred	1
him	1
up	1
another	1
adversary,	1
Rezon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eliadah,	1
which	1
fled	1
from	1
his	1
lord	1
Hadadezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah:	1
11:24	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
men	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
became	1
captain	1
over	1
a	1
band,	1
when	1
David	1
slew	1
them	1
of	1
Zobah:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
Damascus.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
adversary	1
to	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
beside	1
the	1
mischief	1
that	1
Hadad	1
did:	1
and	1
he	1
abhorred	1
Israel,	1
and	1
reigned	1
over	1
Syria.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
an	1
Ephrathite	1
of	1
Zereda,	1
Solomon's	1
servant,	1
whose	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Zeruah,	1
a	1
widow	1
woman,	1
even	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
king:	1
Solomon	1
built	1
Millo,	1
and	1
repaired	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
Jeroboam	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour:	1
and	1
Solomon	1
seeing	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
industrious,	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
when	1
Jeroboam	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
the	1
prophet	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
Shilonite	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
clad	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
were	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
11:30	1
And	1
Ahijah	1
caught	1
the	1
new	1
garment	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
rent	1
it	1
in	1
twelve	1
pieces:	1
11:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Jeroboam,	1
Take	1
thee	1
ten	1
pieces:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
rend	1
the	1
kingdom	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
ten	1
tribes	1
to	1
thee:	1
11:32	1
(But	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
tribe	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
Jerusalem's	1
sake,	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel:)	1
11:33	1
Because	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
worshipped	1
Ashtoreth	1
the	1
goddess	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
Chemosh	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
and	1
Milcom	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
walked	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
judgments,	1
as	1
did	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
11:34	1
Howbeit	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
prince	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
David	1
my	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
whom	1
I	1
chose,	1
because	1
he	1
kept	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
statutes:	1
11:35	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
kingdom	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
hand,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
even	1
ten	1
tribes.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
unto	1
his	1
son	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
one	1
tribe,	1
that	1
David	1
my	1
servant	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
light	1
alway	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
me	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
there.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
reign	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
desireth,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hearken	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
command	1
thee,	1
and	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
do	1
that	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
commandments,	1
as	1
David	1
my	1
servant	1
did;	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
build	1
thee	1
a	1
sure	1
house,	1
as	1
I	1
built	1
for	1
David,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
Israel	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
for	1
this	1
afflict	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
11:40	1
Solomon	1
sought	1
therefore	1
to	1
kill	1
Jeroboam.	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
arose,	1
and	1
fled	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
unto	1
Shishak	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
11:41	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Solomon?	1
11:42	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Solomon	1
reigned	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
over	1
all	1
Israel	1
was	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
11:43	1
And	1
Solomon	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
Rehoboam	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
went	1
to	1
Shechem:	1
for	1
all	1
Israel	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Shechem	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
king.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Egypt;)	1
12:3	1
That	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
him.	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
came,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
Rehoboam,	1
saying,	1
12:4	1
Thy	1
father	1
made	1
our	1
yoke	1
grievous:	1
now	1
therefore	1
make	1
thou	1
the	1
grievous	1
service	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
heavy	1
yoke	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
us,	1
lighter,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
yet	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
then	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
departed.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
consulted	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
men,	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
Solomon	1
his	1
father	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
lived,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
do	1
ye	1
advise	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
answer	1
this	1
people?	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
a	1
servant	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
wilt	1
serve	1
them,	1
and	1
answer	1
them,	1
and	1
speak	1
good	1
words	1
to	1
them,	1
then	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servants	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
12:8	1
But	1
he	1
forsook	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
men,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
and	1
consulted	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
grown	1
up	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
which	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
counsel	1
give	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
answer	1
this	1
people,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Make	1
the	1
yoke	1
which	1
thy	1
father	1
did	1
put	1
upon	1
us	1
lighter?	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
grown	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
speak	1
unto	1
this	1
people	1
that	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
made	1
our	1
yoke	1
heavy,	1
but	1
make	1
thou	1
it	1
lighter	1
unto	1
us;	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
little	1
finger	1
shall	1
be	1
thicker	1
than	1
my	1
father's	1
loins.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
now	1
whereas	1
my	1
father	1
did	1
lade	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
yoke,	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
yoke:	1
my	1
father	1
hath	1
chastised	1
you	1
with	1
whips,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
with	1
scorpions.	1
	1
12:12	1
So	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
appointed,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
to	1
me	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
the	1
people	1
roughly,	1
and	1
forsook	1
the	1
old	1
men's	1
counsel	1
that	1
they	1
gave	1
him;	1
12:14	1
And	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
saying,	1
My	1
father	1
made	1
your	1
yoke	1
heavy,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
yoke:	1
my	1
father	1
also	1
chastised	1
you	1
with	1
whips,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
with	1
scorpions.	1
	1
12:15	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
king	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
perform	1
his	1
saying,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
by	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
Shilonite	1
unto	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat.	1
	1
12:16	1
So	1
when	1
all	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them,	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
What	1
portion	1
have	1
we	1
in	1
David?	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse:	1
to	1
your	1
tents,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
now	1
see	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
David.	1
So	1
Israel	1
departed	1
unto	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Rehoboam	1
reigned	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
12:18	1
Then	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
sent	1
Adoram,	1
who	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
tribute;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
Therefore	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
made	1
speed	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chariot,	1
to	1
flee	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:19	1
So	1
Israel	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
all	1
Israel	1
heard	1
that	1
Jeroboam	1
was	1
come	1
again,	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel:	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
but	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah	1
only.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
when	1
Rehoboam	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
warriors,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
kingdom	1
again	1
to	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
12:22	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
saying,	1
12:23	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Rehoboam,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
12:24	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
up,	1
nor	1
fight	1
against	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house;	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
from	1
me.	1
They	1
hearkened	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
depart,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:25	1
Then	1
Jeroboam	1
built	1
Shechem	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
therein;	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
built	1
Penuel.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Now	1
shall	1
the	1
kingdom	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David:	1
12:27	1
If	1
this	1
people	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
turn	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
lord,	1
even	1
unto	1
Rehoboam	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
me,	1
and	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
Rehoboam	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
12:28	1
Whereupon	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
counsel,	1
and	1
made	1
two	1
calves	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
behold	1
thy	1
gods,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
which	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
put	1
he	1
in	1
Dan.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
this	1
thing	1
became	1
a	1
sin:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
one,	1
even	1
unto	1
Dan.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
made	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
ordained	1
a	1
feast	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
feast	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
So	1
did	1
he	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
sacrificing	1
unto	1
the	1
calves	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made:	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
in	1
Bethel	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
12:33	1
So	1
he	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
Bethel	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
devised	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart;	1
and	1
ordained	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense.	1
	1
13:1	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
Judah	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
altar	1
to	1
burn	1
incense.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
against	1
the	1
altar	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
altar,	1
altar,	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
a	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
Josiah	1
by	1
name;	1
and	1
upon	1
thee	1
shall	1
he	1
offer	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
that	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
men's	1
bones	1
shall	1
be	1
burnt	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sign	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken;	1
Behold,	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
rent,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
that	1
are	1
upon	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
king	1
Jeroboam	1
heard	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
had	1
cried	1
against	1
the	1
altar	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
saying,	1
Lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him.	1
And	1
his	1
hand,	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
against	1
him,	1
dried	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
pull	1
it	1
in	1
again	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
13:5	1
The	1
altar	1
also	1
was	1
rent,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
poured	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
sign	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
Intreat	1
now	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
my	1
hand	1
may	1
be	1
restored	1
me	1
again.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
before.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
Come	1
home	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
refresh	1
thyself,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
reward.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
give	1
me	1
half	1
thine	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
thee,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
eat	1
bread	1
nor	1
drink	1
water	1
in	1
this	1
place:	1
13:9	1
For	1
so	1
was	1
it	1
charged	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Eat	1
no	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water,	1
nor	1
turn	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
camest.	1
	1
13:10	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
another	1
way,	1
and	1
returned	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Bethel.	1
	1
13:11	1
Now	1
there	1
dwelt	1
an	1
old	1
prophet	1
in	1
Bethel;	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
Bethel:	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
them	1
they	1
told	1
also	1
to	1
their	1
father.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
their	1
father	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
way	1
went	1
he?	1
For	1
his	1
sons	1
had	1
seen	1
what	1
way	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
went,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Judah.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
sons,	1
Saddle	1
me	1
the	1
ass.	1
So	1
they	1
saddled	1
him	1
the	1
ass:	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
thereon,	1
13:14	1
And	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
sitting	1
under	1
an	1
oak:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
camest	1
from	1
Judah?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:15	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
home	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
return	1
with	1
thee,	1
nor	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
thee:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
eat	1
bread	1
nor	1
drink	1
water	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
place:	1
13:17	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
no	1
bread	1
nor	1
drink	1
water	1
there,	1
nor	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
camest.	1
	1
13:18	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
prophet	1
also	1
as	1
thou	1
art;	1
and	1
an	1
angel	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
Bring	1
him	1
back	1
with	1
thee	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
bread	1
and	1
drink	1
water.	1
But	1
he	1
lied	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:19	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
drank	1
water.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
back:	1
13:21	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
disobeyed	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
commandment	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
13:22	1
But	1
camest	1
back,	1
and	1
hast	1
eaten	1
bread	1
and	1
drunk	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
did	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
Eat	1
no	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
no	1
water;	1
thy	1
carcase	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
bread,	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
drunk,	1
that	1
he	1
saddled	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
ass,	1
to	1
wit,	1
for	1
the	1
prophet	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
back.	1
	1
13:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
a	1
lion	1
met	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
slew	1
him:	1
and	1
his	1
carcase	1
was	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
stood	1
by	1
it,	1
the	1
lion	1
also	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
carcase.	1
	1
13:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
men	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
carcase	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
carcase:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
prophet	1
dwelt.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
was	1
disobedient	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
delivered	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
lion,	1
which	1
hath	1
torn	1
him,	1
and	1
slain	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
Saddle	1
me	1
the	1
ass.	1
And	1
they	1
saddled	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
found	1
his	1
carcase	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
and	1
the	1
lion	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
carcase:	1
the	1
lion	1
had	1
not	1
eaten	1
the	1
carcase,	1
nor	1
torn	1
the	1
ass.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
back:	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
prophet	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
to	1
mourn	1
and	1
to	1
bury	1
him.	1
	1
13:30	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
carcase	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
grave;	1
and	1
they	1
mourned	1
over	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
brother!	1
	1
13:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
buried	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
his	1
sons,	1
saying,	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
dead,	1
then	1
bury	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
wherein	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
buried;	1
lay	1
my	1
bones	1
beside	1
his	1
bones:	1
13:32	1
For	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
he	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
the	1
altar	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
shall	1
surely	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
13:33	1
After	1
this	1
thing	1
Jeroboam	1
returned	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
but	1
made	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places:	1
whosoever	1
would,	1
he	1
consecrated	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
13:34	1
And	1
this	1
thing	1
became	1
sin	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
even	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Abijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
fell	1
sick.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
Arise,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
disguise	1
thyself,	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Jeroboam;	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
Shiloh:	1
behold,	1
there	1
is	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
ten	1
loaves,	1
and	1
cracknels,	1
and	1
a	1
cruse	1
of	1
honey,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
shall	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
Jeroboam's	1
wife	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Shiloh,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahijah.	1
But	1
Ahijah	1
could	1
not	1
see;	1
for	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
set	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
age.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahijah,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
cometh	1
to	1
ask	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
thee	1
for	1
her	1
son;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
sick:	1
thus	1
and	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
her:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
she	1
cometh	1
in,	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
feign	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
another	1
woman.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Ahijah	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
feet,	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Come	1
in,	1
thou	1
wife	1
of	1
Jeroboam;	1
why	1
feignest	1
thou	1
thyself	1
to	1
be	1
another?	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
heavy	1
tidings.	1
	1
14:7	1
Go,	1
tell	1
Jeroboam,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
exalted	1
thee	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
prince	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
14:8	1
And	1
rent	1
the	1
kingdom	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
thee:	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
been	1
as	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
who	1
kept	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
who	1
followed	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
only	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes;	1
14:9	1
But	1
hast	1
done	1
evil	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
molten	1
images,	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
hast	1
cast	1
me	1
behind	1
thy	1
back:	1
14:10	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Jeroboam	1
him	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
in	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taketh	1
away	1
dung,	1
till	1
it	1
be	1
all	1
gone.	1
	1
14:11	1
Him	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
the	1
dogs	1
eat;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
dieth	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
eat:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
14:12	1
Arise	1
thou	1
therefore,	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house:	1
and	1
when	1
thy	1
feet	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
the	1
child	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
mourn	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
bury	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
only	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
grave,	1
because	1
in	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
found	1
some	1
good	1
thing	1
toward	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam.	1
	1
14:14	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
who	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
that	1
day:	1
but	1
what?	1
even	1
now.	1
	1
14:15	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
smite	1
Israel,	1
as	1
a	1
reed	1
is	1
shaken	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
root	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
land,	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
to	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
shall	1
scatter	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
groves,	1
provoking	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
Israel	1
up	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
who	1
did	1
sin,	1
and	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
Jeroboam's	1
wife	1
arose,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Tirzah:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
child	1
died;	1
14:18	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
mourned	1
for	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
how	1
he	1
warred,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
reigned,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
days	1
which	1
Jeroboam	1
reigned	1
were	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
years:	1
and	1
he	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
Nadab	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon	1
reigned	1
in	1
Judah.	1
Rehoboam	1
was	1
forty	1
and	1
one	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
seventeen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
choose	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
there.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Naamah	1
an	1
Ammonitess.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
Judah	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
they	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
jealousy	1
with	1
their	1
sins	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
committed,	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
their	1
fathers	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
14:23	1
For	1
they	1
also	1
built	1
them	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
images,	1
and	1
groves,	1
on	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
sodomites	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Rehoboam,	1
that	1
Shishak	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Jerusalem:	1
14:26	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house;	1
he	1
even	1
took	1
away	1
all:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
gold	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
made	1
in	1
their	1
stead	1
brasen	1
shields,	1
and	1
committed	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
which	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
guard	1
bare	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
guard	1
chamber.	1
	1
14:29	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Rehoboam,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
14:30	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Rehoboam	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
all	1
their	1
days.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Naamah	1
an	1
Ammonitess.	1
And	1
Abijam	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat	1
reigned	1
Abijam	1
over	1
Judah.	1
	1
15:2	1
Three	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
and	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Maachah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abishalom.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
perfect	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
15:4	1
Nevertheless	1
for	1
David's	1
sake	1
did	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
son	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
Jerusalem:	1
15:5	1
Because	1
David	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
turned	1
not	1
aside	1
from	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
save	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
Hittite.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Rehoboam	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
15:7	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Abijam,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Abijam	1
and	1
Jeroboam.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
Abijam	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Asa	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
reigned	1
Asa	1
over	1
Judah.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
forty	1
and	1
one	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Maachah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abishalom.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
Asa	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
did	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
sodomites	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
removed	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
that	1
his	1
fathers	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
also	1
Maachah	1
his	1
mother,	1
even	1
her	1
he	1
removed	1
from	1
being	1
queen,	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
idol	1
in	1
a	1
grove;	1
and	1
Asa	1
destroyed	1
her	1
idol,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron.	1
	1
15:14	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
removed:	1
nevertheless	1
Asa's	1
heart	1
was	1
perfect	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
dedicated,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
himself	1
had	1
dedicated,	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
vessels.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Asa	1
and	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
all	1
their	1
days.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
built	1
Ramah,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
suffer	1
any	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
or	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
15:18	1
Then	1
Asa	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants:	1
and	1
king	1
Asa	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Benhadad,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tabrimon,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hezion,	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
saying,	1
15:19	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
league	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
and	1
between	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
father:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
gold;	1
come	1
and	1
break	1
thy	1
league	1
with	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
15:20	1
So	1
Benhadad	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
king	1
Asa,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
hosts	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
against	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
smote	1
Ijon,	1
and	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Abelbethmaachah,	1
and	1
all	1
Cinneroth,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Baasha	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
building	1
of	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
15:22	1
Then	1
king	1
Asa	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judah;	1
none	1
was	1
exempted:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
the	1
timber	1
thereof,	1
wherewith	1
Baasha	1
had	1
builded;	1
and	1
king	1
Asa	1
built	1
with	1
them	1
Geba	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
Mizpah.	1
	1
15:23	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Asa,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
he	1
built,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
Nevertheless	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
age	1
he	1
was	1
diseased	1
in	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
Asa	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
Nadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sin	1
wherewith	1
he	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
Baasha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahijah,	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Issachar,	1
conspired	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
Baasha	1
smote	1
him	1
at	1
Gibbethon,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
for	1
Nadab	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
laid	1
siege	1
to	1
Gibbethon.	1
	1
15:28	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
did	1
Baasha	1
slay	1
him,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
reigned,	1
that	1
he	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam;	1
he	1
left	1
not	1
to	1
Jeroboam	1
any	1
that	1
breathed,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
him,	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
his	1
servant	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
Shilonite:	1
15:30	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
which	1
he	1
sinned,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
Israel	1
sin,	1
by	1
his	1
provocation	1
wherewith	1
he	1
provoked	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
15:31	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
15:32	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Asa	1
and	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
all	1
their	1
days.	1
	1
15:33	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Baasha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahijah	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
all	1
Israel	1
in	1
Tirzah,	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
years.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sin	1
wherewith	1
he	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hanani	1
against	1
Baasha,	1
saying,	1
16:2	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
exalted	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
prince	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
my	1
people	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin,	1
to	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
sins;	1
16:3	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
posterity	1
of	1
Baasha,	1
and	1
the	1
posterity	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
house	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat.	1
	1
16:4	1
Him	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
Baasha	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
the	1
dogs	1
eat;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
his	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
shall	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
eat.	1
	1
16:5	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Baasha,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
16:6	1
So	1
Baasha	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Tirzah:	1
and	1
Elah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hanani	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
Baasha,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
house,	1
even	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
provoking	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
in	1
being	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam;	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
killed	1
him.	1
	1
16:8	1
In	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Elah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Baasha	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Tirzah,	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
his	1
servant	1
Zimri,	1
captain	1
of	1
half	1
his	1
chariots,	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Tirzah,	1
drinking	1
himself	1
drunk	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Arza	1
steward	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
Zimri	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
killed	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
that	1
he	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baasha:	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
a	1
wall,	1
neither	1
of	1
his	1
kinsfolks,	1
nor	1
of	1
his	1
friends.	1
	1
16:12	1
Thus	1
did	1
Zimri	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baasha,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
against	1
Baasha	1
by	1
Jehu	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
16:13	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Baasha,	1
and	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Elah	1
his	1
son,	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
sinned,	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin,	1
in	1
provoking	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
vanities.	1
	1
16:14	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Elah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
16:15	1
In	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
did	1
Zimri	1
reign	1
seven	1
days	1
in	1
Tirzah.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
encamped	1
against	1
Gibbethon,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
encamped	1
heard	1
say,	1
Zimri	1
hath	1
conspired,	1
and	1
hath	1
also	1
slain	1
the	1
king:	1
wherefore	1
all	1
Israel	1
made	1
Omri,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
king	1
over	1
Israel	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Omri	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Gibbethon,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
besieged	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Zimri	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
taken,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
burnt	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
died.	1
	1
16:19	1
For	1
his	1
sins	1
which	1
he	1
sinned	1
in	1
doing	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sin	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
to	1
make	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
16:20	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Zimri,	1
and	1
his	1
treason	1
that	1
he	1
wrought,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
16:21	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
parts:	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
Tibni	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ginath,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
king;	1
and	1
half	1
followed	1
Omri.	1
	1
16:22	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
followed	1
Omri	1
prevailed	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
followed	1
Tibni	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ginath:	1
so	1
Tibni	1
died,	1
and	1
Omri	1
reigned.	1
	1
16:23	1
In	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Omri	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel,	1
twelve	1
years:	1
six	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Tirzah.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
the	1
hill	1
Samaria	1
of	1
Shemer	1
for	1
two	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
built	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
he	1
built,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Shemer,	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
Samaria.	1
	1
16:25	1
But	1
Omri	1
wrought	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
did	1
worse	1
than	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
16:26	1
For	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
sin	1
wherewith	1
he	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin,	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
their	1
vanities.	1
	1
16:27	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Omri	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might	1
that	1
he	1
shewed,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
16:28	1
So	1
Omri	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Samaria:	1
and	1
Ahab	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
16:29	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Ahab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Omri	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel:	1
and	1
Ahab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Omri	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
Ahab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Omri	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
wife	1
Jezebel	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ethbaal	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
served	1
Baal,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
an	1
altar	1
for	1
Baal	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
Ahab	1
made	1
a	1
grove;	1
and	1
Ahab	1
did	1
more	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
anger	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
16:34	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
did	1
Hiel	1
the	1
Bethelite	1
build	1
Jericho:	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
thereof	1
in	1
Abiram	1
his	1
firstborn,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
in	1
his	1
youngest	1
son	1
Segub,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahab,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
liveth,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
stand,	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
dew	1
nor	1
rain	1
these	1
years,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
17:3	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence,	1
and	1
turn	1
thee	1
eastward,	1
and	1
hide	1
thyself	1
by	1
the	1
brook	1
Cherith,	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Jordan.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
brook;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
the	1
ravens	1
to	1
feed	1
thee	1
there.	1
	1
17:5	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
dwelt	1
by	1
the	1
brook	1
Cherith,	1
that	1
is	1
before	1
Jordan.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
ravens	1
brought	1
him	1
bread	1
and	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
bread	1
and	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
he	1
drank	1
of	1
the	1
brook.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
that	1
the	1
brook	1
dried	1
up,	1
because	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
17:9	1
Arise,	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
Zarephath,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
a	1
widow	1
woman	1
there	1
to	1
sustain	1
thee.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Zarephath.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
the	1
widow	1
woman	1
was	1
there	1
gathering	1
of	1
sticks:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Fetch	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
little	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
vessel,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
drink.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
fetch	1
it,	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Bring	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
liveth,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
cake,	1
but	1
an	1
handful	1
of	1
meal	1
in	1
a	1
barrel,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
oil	1
in	1
a	1
cruse:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
gathering	1
two	1
sticks,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
dress	1
it	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
son,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat	1
it,	1
and	1
die.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
go	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said:	1
but	1
make	1
me	1
thereof	1
a	1
little	1
cake	1
first,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
after	1
make	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
17:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
The	1
barrel	1
of	1
meal	1
shall	1
not	1
waste,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
oil	1
fail,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
sendeth	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Elijah:	1
and	1
she,	1
and	1
he,	1
and	1
her	1
house,	1
did	1
eat	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
barrel	1
of	1
meal	1
wasted	1
not,	1
neither	1
did	1
the	1
cruse	1
of	1
oil	1
fail,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
Elijah.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
fell	1
sick;	1
and	1
his	1
sickness	1
was	1
so	1
sore,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
breath	1
left	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
Elijah,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
man	1
of	1
God?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
call	1
my	1
sin	1
to	1
remembrance,	1
and	1
to	1
slay	1
my	1
son?	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me	1
thy	1
son.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
loft,	1
where	1
he	1
abode,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
bed.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
brought	1
evil	1
upon	1
the	1
widow	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
sojourn,	1
by	1
slaying	1
her	1
son?	1
	1
17:21	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
child	1
three	1
times,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
this	1
child's	1
soul	1
come	1
into	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Elijah;	1
and	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
came	1
into	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
revived.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
Elijah	1
took	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
mother:	1
and	1
Elijah	1
said,	1
See,	1
thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
said	1
to	1
Elijah,	1
Now	1
by	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
many	1
days,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Elijah	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year,	1
saying,	1
Go,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
unto	1
Ahab;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
rain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Elijah	1
went	1
to	1
shew	1
himself	1
unto	1
Ahab.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sore	1
famine	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
Ahab	1
called	1
Obadiah,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
(Now	1
Obadiah	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
greatly:	1
18:4	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Jezebel	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
Obadiah	1
took	1
an	1
hundred	1
prophets,	1
and	1
hid	1
them	1
by	1
fifty	1
in	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
fed	1
them	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
water.)	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
Ahab	1
said	1
unto	1
Obadiah,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
unto	1
all	1
fountains	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
brooks:	1
peradventure	1
we	1
may	1
find	1
grass	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
mules	1
alive,	1
that	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
beasts.	1
	1
18:6	1
So	1
they	1
divided	1
the	1
land	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
throughout	1
it:	1
Ahab	1
went	1
one	1
way	1
by	1
himself,	1
and	1
Obadiah	1
went	1
another	1
way	1
by	1
himself.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
as	1
Obadiah	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
behold,	1
Elijah	1
met	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
said,	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
Elijah?	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
am:	1
go,	1
tell	1
thy	1
lord,	1
Behold,	1
Elijah	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
sinned,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
deliver	1
thy	1
servant	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
to	1
slay	1
me?	1
	1
18:10	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
liveth,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
nation	1
or	1
kingdom,	1
whither	1
my	1
lord	1
hath	1
not	1
sent	1
to	1
seek	1
thee:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
there;	1
he	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
nation,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
thee	1
not.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
now	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Go,	1
tell	1
thy	1
lord,	1
Behold,	1
Elijah	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
from	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
whither	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
and	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
find	1
thee,	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
thy	1
servant	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
18:13	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
told	1
my	1
lord	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
when	1
Jezebel	1
slew	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
how	1
I	1
hid	1
an	1
hundred	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
prophets	1
by	1
fifty	1
in	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
fed	1
them	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
water?	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
now	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Go,	1
tell	1
thy	1
lord,	1
Behold,	1
Elijah	1
is	1
here:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
slay	1
me.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
liveth,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
stand,	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
shew	1
myself	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
18:16	1
So	1
Obadiah	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
told	1
him:	1
and	1
Ahab	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
Elijah.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Ahab	1
saw	1
Elijah,	1
that	1
Ahab	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
troubleth	1
Israel?	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
troubled	1
Israel;	1
but	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
followed	1
Baalim.	1
	1
18:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
send,	1
and	1
gather	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
Israel	1
unto	1
mount	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Baal	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
the	1
groves	1
four	1
hundred,	1
which	1
eat	1
at	1
Jezebel's	1
table.	1
	1
18:20	1
So	1
Ahab	1
sent	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
prophets	1
together	1
unto	1
mount	1
Carmel.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
Elijah	1
came	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
How	1
long	1
halt	1
ye	1
between	1
two	1
opinions?	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
God,	1
follow	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
Baal,	1
then	1
follow	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
	1
18:22	1
Then	1
said	1
Elijah	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
only,	1
remain	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
Baal's	1
prophets	1
are	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
men.	1
	1
18:23	1
Let	1
them	1
therefore	1
give	1
us	1
two	1
bullocks;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
choose	1
one	1
bullock	1
for	1
themselves,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
on	1
wood,	1
and	1
put	1
no	1
fire	1
under:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dress	1
the	1
other	1
bullock,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
on	1
wood,	1
and	1
put	1
no	1
fire	1
under:	1
18:24	1
And	1
call	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
gods,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
answereth	1
by	1
fire,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
God.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
spoken.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Baal,	1
Choose	1
you	1
one	1
bullock	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
dress	1
it	1
first;	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
many;	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
gods,	1
but	1
put	1
no	1
fire	1
under.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
bullock	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
dressed	1
it,	1
and	1
called	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Baal	1
from	1
morning	1
even	1
until	1
noon,	1
saying,	1
O	1
Baal,	1
hear	1
us.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
voice,	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
answered.	1
And	1
they	1
leaped	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
made.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
noon,	1
that	1
Elijah	1
mocked	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Cry	1
aloud:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
god;	1
either	1
he	1
is	1
talking,	1
or	1
he	1
is	1
pursuing,	1
or	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
journey,	1
or	1
peradventure	1
he	1
sleepeth,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
awaked.	1
	1
18:28	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
and	1
cut	1
themselves	1
after	1
their	1
manner	1
with	1
knives	1
and	1
lancets,	1
till	1
the	1
blood	1
gushed	1
out	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
midday	1
was	1
past,	1
and	1
they	1
prophesied	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
sacrifice,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
voice,	1
nor	1
any	1
to	1
answer,	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
regarded.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Come	1
near	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
repaired	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
was	1
broken	1
down.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
Elijah	1
took	1
twelve	1
stones,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
thy	1
name:	1
18:32	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
stones	1
he	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
trench	1
about	1
the	1
altar,	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
would	1
contain	1
two	1
measures	1
of	1
seed.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
wood	1
in	1
order,	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
bullock	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
said,	1
Fill	1
four	1
barrels	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Do	1
it	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
it	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Do	1
it	1
the	1
third	1
time.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
it	1
the	1
third	1
time.	1
	1
18:35	1
And	1
the	1
water	1
ran	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
altar;	1
and	1
he	1
filled	1
the	1
trench	1
also	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
18:36	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
sacrifice,	1
that	1
Elijah	1
the	1
prophet	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
this	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
God	1
in	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
at	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
18:37	1
Hear	1
me,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hear	1
me,	1
that	1
this	1
people	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
turned	1
their	1
heart	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
18:38	1
Then	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
fell,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
stones,	1
and	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
licked	1
up	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
trench.	1
	1
18:39	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
faces:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
God;	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
God.	1
	1
18:40	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Baal;	1
let	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
escape.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
them:	1
and	1
Elijah	1
brought	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
Kishon,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
18:41	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
Ahab,	1
Get	1
thee	1
up,	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
abundance	1
of	1
rain.	1
	1
18:42	1
So	1
Ahab	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink.	1
And	1
Elijah	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel;	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
himself	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
face	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
18:43	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Go	1
up	1
now,	1
look	1
toward	1
the	1
sea.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
nothing.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
again	1
seven	1
times.	1
	1
18:44	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
seventh	1
time,	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
there	1
ariseth	1
a	1
little	1
cloud	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
like	1
a	1
man's	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
up,	1
say	1
unto	1
Ahab,	1
Prepare	1
thy	1
chariot,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down	1
that	1
the	1
rain	1
stop	1
thee	1
not.	1
	1
18:45	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
while,	1
that	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
black	1
with	1
clouds	1
and	1
wind,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
rain.	1
And	1
Ahab	1
rode,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
18:46	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
on	1
Elijah;	1
and	1
he	1
girded	1
up	1
his	1
loins,	1
and	1
ran	1
before	1
Ahab	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Ahab	1
told	1
Jezebel	1
all	1
that	1
Elijah	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
withal	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
19:2	1
Then	1
Jezebel	1
sent	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
Elijah,	1
saying,	1
So	1
let	1
the	1
gods	1
do	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
not	1
thy	1
life	1
as	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that,	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
left	1
his	1
servant	1
there.	1
	1
19:4	1
But	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
a	1
day's	1
journey	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
under	1
a	1
juniper	1
tree:	1
and	1
he	1
requested	1
for	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
die;	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
enough;	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
life;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
better	1
than	1
my	1
fathers.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
and	1
slept	1
under	1
a	1
juniper	1
tree,	1
behold,	1
then	1
an	1
angel	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
he	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cake	1
baken	1
on	1
the	1
coals,	1
and	1
a	1
cruse	1
of	1
water	1
at	1
his	1
head.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise	1
and	1
eat;	1
because	1
the	1
journey	1
is	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
that	1
meat	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights	1
unto	1
Horeb	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
thither	1
unto	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
lodged	1
there;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou	1
here,	1
Elijah?	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
jealous	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
forsaken	1
thy	1
covenant,	1
thrown	1
down	1
thine	1
altars,	1
and	1
slain	1
thy	1
prophets	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
only,	1
am	1
left;	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
forth,	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
strong	1
wind	1
rent	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
rocks	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
wind:	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
wind	1
an	1
earthquake;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
earthquake:	1
19:12	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
earthquake	1
a	1
fire;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
fire:	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
fire	1
a	1
still	1
small	1
voice.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Elijah	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
wrapped	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
cave.	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou	1
here,	1
Elijah?	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
jealous	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts:	1
because	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
forsaken	1
thy	1
covenant,	1
thrown	1
down	1
thine	1
altars,	1
and	1
slain	1
thy	1
prophets	1
with	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
only,	1
am	1
left;	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life,	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
return	1
on	1
thy	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
comest,	1
anoint	1
Hazael	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Syria:	1
19:16	1
And	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nimshi	1
shalt	1
thou	1
anoint	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Israel:	1
and	1
Elisha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphat	1
of	1
Abelmeholah	1
shalt	1
thou	1
anoint	1
to	1
be	1
prophet	1
in	1
thy	1
room.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
him	1
that	1
escapeth	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Hazael	1
shall	1
Jehu	1
slay:	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
escapeth	1
from	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Jehu	1
shall	1
Elisha	1
slay.	1
	1
19:18	1
Yet	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
seven	1
thousand	1
in	1
Israel,	1
all	1
the	1
knees	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
bowed	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
and	1
every	1
mouth	1
which	1
hath	1
not	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
19:19	1
So	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
found	1
Elisha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphat,	1
who	1
was	1
plowing	1
with	1
twelve	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
twelfth:	1
and	1
Elijah	1
passed	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
mantle	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
ran	1
after	1
Elijah,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
kiss	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
back	1
again:	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
thee?	1
19:21	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
back	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
boiled	1
their	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat.	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
Elijah,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
Benhadad	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
host	1
together:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
kings	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
besieged	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
warred	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Benhadad,	1
20:3	1
Thy	1
silver	1
and	1
thy	1
gold	1
is	1
mine;	1
thy	1
wives	1
also	1
and	1
thy	1
children,	1
even	1
the	1
goodliest,	1
are	1
mine.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
thine,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
Benhadad,	1
saying,	1
Although	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
deliver	1
me	1
thy	1
silver,	1
and	1
thy	1
gold,	1
and	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
thy	1
children;	1
20:6	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
servants	1
unto	1
thee	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
search	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
thy	1
servants;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
pleasant	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
they	1
shall	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
away.	1
	1
20:7	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
said,	1
Mark,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
this	1
man	1
seeketh	1
mischief:	1
for	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
wives,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
children,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
gold;	1
and	1
I	1
denied	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
him,	1
nor	1
consent.	1
	1
20:9	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
Benhadad,	1
Tell	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
All	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
for	1
to	1
thy	1
servant	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
will	1
do:	1
but	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
do.	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
departed,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
word	1
again.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Benhadad	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
gods	1
do	1
so	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
more	1
also,	1
if	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
suffice	1
for	1
handfuls	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Tell	1
him,	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
girdeth	1
on	1
his	1
harness	1
boast	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
it	1
off.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Ben-hadad	1
heard	1
this	1
message,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
drinking,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
in	1
the	1
pavilions,	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Set	1
yourselves	1
in	1
array.	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
prophet	1
unto	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
multitude?	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
thine	1
hand	1
this	1
day;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
Ahab	1
said,	1
By	1
whom?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Even	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
provinces.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
shall	1
order	1
the	1
battle?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Thou.	1
	1
20:15	1
Then	1
he	1
numbered	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
two:	1
and	1
after	1
them	1
he	1
numbered	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
being	1
seven	1
thousand.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
noon.	1
But	1
Benhadad	1
was	1
drinking	1
himself	1
drunk	1
in	1
the	1
pavilions,	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
kings,	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
kings	1
that	1
helped	1
him.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
went	1
out	1
first;	1
and	1
Benhadad	1
sent	1
out,	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
There	1
are	1
men	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Samaria.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Whether	1
they	1
be	1
come	1
out	1
for	1
peace,	1
take	1
them	1
alive;	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
come	1
out	1
for	1
war,	1
take	1
them	1
alive.	1
	1
20:19	1
So	1
these	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
followed	1
them.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
man:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
fled;	1
and	1
Israel	1
pursued	1
them:	1
and	1
Benhadad	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
escaped	1
on	1
an	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
horsemen.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Syrians	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
strengthen	1
thyself,	1
and	1
mark,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
thou	1
doest:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
will	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Their	1
gods	1
are	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
hills;	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
stronger	1
than	1
we;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
surely	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
do	1
this	1
thing,	1
Take	1
the	1
kings	1
away,	1
every	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
put	1
captains	1
in	1
their	1
rooms:	1
20:25	1
And	1
number	1
thee	1
an	1
army,	1
like	1
the	1
army	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
lost,	1
horse	1
for	1
horse,	1
and	1
chariot	1
for	1
chariot:	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
surely	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
they.	1
And	1
he	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
their	1
voice,	1
and	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
that	1
Benhadad	1
numbered	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Aphek,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:27	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
numbered,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
present,	1
and	1
went	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
pitched	1
before	1
them	1
like	1
two	1
little	1
flocks	1
of	1
kids;	1
but	1
the	1
Syrians	1
filled	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Because	1
the	1
Syrians	1
have	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
hills,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
valleys,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
multitude	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
they	1
pitched	1
one	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
seven	1
days.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
joined:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
footmen	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
20:30	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
fled	1
to	1
Aphek,	1
into	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
wall	1
fell	1
upon	1
twenty	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
left.	1
And	1
Benhadad	1
fled,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
into	1
an	1
inner	1
chamber.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
are	1
merciful	1
kings:	1
let	1
us,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
put	1
sackcloth	1
on	1
our	1
loins,	1
and	1
ropes	1
upon	1
our	1
heads,	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel:	1
peradventure	1
he	1
will	1
save	1
thy	1
life.	1
	1
20:32	1
So	1
they	1
girded	1
sackcloth	1
on	1
their	1
loins,	1
and	1
put	1
ropes	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
Benhadad	1
saith,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
me	1
live.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
he	1
yet	1
alive?	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
brother.	1
	1
20:33	1
Now	1
the	1
men	1
did	1
diligently	1
observe	1
whether	1
any	1
thing	1
would	1
come	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
did	1
hastily	1
catch	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
Benhadad.	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
bring	1
him.	1
Then	1
Benhadad	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
chariot.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
Ben-hadad	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
cities,	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
took	1
from	1
thy	1
father,	1
I	1
will	1
restore;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
streets	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
Damascus,	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
made	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahab,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
away	1
with	1
this	1
covenant.	1
So	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
neighbour	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Smite	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
refused	1
to	1
smite	1
him.	1
	1
20:36	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
behold,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
departed	1
from	1
me,	1
a	1
lion	1
shall	1
slay	1
thee.	1
	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
a	1
lion	1
found	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
20:37	1
Then	1
he	1
found	1
another	1
man,	1
and	1
said,	1
Smite	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
smote	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
smiting	1
he	1
wounded	1
him.	1
	1
20:38	1
So	1
the	1
prophet	1
departed,	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
disguised	1
himself	1
with	1
ashes	1
upon	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
20:39	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
battle;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
man	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
Keep	1
this	1
man:	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
he	1
be	1
missing,	1
then	1
shall	1
thy	1
life	1
be	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
or	1
else	1
thou	1
shalt	1
pay	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
as	1
thy	1
servant	1
was	1
busy	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
he	1
was	1
gone.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
judgment	1
be;	1
thyself	1
hast	1
decided	1
it.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
he	1
hasted,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
ashes	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
discerned	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
20:42	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
let	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
hand	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
appointed	1
to	1
utter	1
destruction,	1
therefore	1
thy	1
life	1
shall	1
go	1
for	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
20:43	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
heavy	1
and	1
displeased,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite	1
had	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jezreel,	1
hard	1
by	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Samaria.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
Ahab	1
spake	1
unto	1
Naboth,	1
saying,	1
Give	1
me	1
thy	1
vineyard,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
garden	1
of	1
herbs,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
near	1
unto	1
my	1
house:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
it	1
a	1
better	1
vineyard	1
than	1
it;	1
or,	1
if	1
it	1
seem	1
good	1
to	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
money.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
Naboth	1
said	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
The	1
LORD	1
forbid	1
it	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
give	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
my	1
fathers	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
Ahab	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
heavy	1
and	1
displeased	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
my	1
fathers.	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
him	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
would	1
eat	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
21:5	1
But	1
Jezebel	1
his	1
wife	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
is	1
thy	1
spirit	1
so	1
sad,	1
that	1
thou	1
eatest	1
no	1
bread?	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Because	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
thy	1
vineyard	1
for	1
money;	1
or	1
else,	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
another	1
vineyard	1
for	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
thee	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
Jezebel	1
his	1
wife	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
now	1
govern	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Israel?	1
arise,	1
and	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
heart	1
be	1
merry:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite.	1
	1
21:8	1
So	1
she	1
wrote	1
letters	1
in	1
Ahab's	1
name,	1
and	1
sealed	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
seal,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
letters	1
unto	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
nobles	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
city,	1
dwelling	1
with	1
Naboth.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
she	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
letters,	1
saying,	1
Proclaim	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
set	1
Naboth	1
on	1
high	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
21:10	1
And	1
set	1
two	1
men,	1
sons	1
of	1
Belial,	1
before	1
him,	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
didst	1
blaspheme	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
then	1
carry	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
stone	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
city,	1
even	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
nobles	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
in	1
his	1
city,	1
did	1
as	1
Jezebel	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
letters	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
21:12	1
They	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
set	1
Naboth	1
on	1
high	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
two	1
men,	1
children	1
of	1
Belial,	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Belial	1
witnessed	1
against	1
him,	1
even	1
against	1
Naboth,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Naboth	1
did	1
blaspheme	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king.	1
Then	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
21:14	1
Then	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
Jezebel,	1
saying,	1
Naboth	1
is	1
stoned,	1
and	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jezebel	1
heard	1
that	1
Naboth	1
was	1
stoned,	1
and	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
Jezebel	1
said	1
to	1
Ahab,	1
Arise,	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite,	1
which	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
for	1
money:	1
for	1
Naboth	1
is	1
not	1
alive,	1
but	1
dead.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Ahab	1
heard	1
that	1
Naboth	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
Ahab	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite,	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite,	1
saying,	1
21:18	1
Arise,	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Samaria:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
Naboth,	1
whither	1
he	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
killed,	1
and	1
also	1
taken	1
possession?	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
In	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
dogs	1
licked	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Naboth	1
shall	1
dogs	1
lick	1
thy	1
blood,	1
even	1
thine.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
Ahab	1
said	1
to	1
Elijah,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
found	1
me,	1
O	1
mine	1
enemy?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
thee:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
sold	1
thyself	1
to	1
work	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:21	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
posterity,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Ahab	1
him	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
in	1
Israel,	1
21:22	1
And	1
will	1
make	1
thine	1
house	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baasha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahijah,	1
for	1
the	1
provocation	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
hast	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
of	1
Jezebel	1
also	1
spake	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
dogs	1
shall	1
eat	1
Jezebel	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
21:24	1
Him	1
that	1
dieth	1
of	1
Ahab	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
the	1
dogs	1
shall	1
eat;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
dieth	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
eat.	1
	1
21:25	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
unto	1
Ahab,	1
which	1
did	1
sell	1
himself	1
to	1
work	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whom	1
Jezebel	1
his	1
wife	1
stirred	1
up.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
very	1
abominably	1
in	1
following	1
idols,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Ahab	1
heard	1
those	1
words,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
put	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
and	1
lay	1
in	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
went	1
softly.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite,	1
saying,	1
21:29	1
Seest	1
thou	1
how	1
Ahab	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
before	1
me?	1
because	1
he	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
before	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
bring	1
the	1
evil	1
in	1
his	1
days:	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
son's	1
days	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
evil	1
upon	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
they	1
continued	1
three	1
years	1
without	1
war	1
between	1
Syria	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year,	1
that	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
Ramoth	1
in	1
Gilead	1
is	1
ours,	1
and	1
we	1
be	1
still,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria?	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
battle	1
to	1
Ramothgilead?	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
thou	1
art,	1
my	1
people	1
as	1
thy	1
people,	1
my	1
horses	1
as	1
thy	1
horses.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Enquire,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
22:6	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
the	1
prophets	1
together,	1
about	1
four	1
hundred	1
men,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
against	1
Ramothgilead	1
to	1
battle,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
forbear?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Go	1
up;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
here	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
besides,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
enquire	1
of	1
him?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
There	1
is	1
yet	1
one	1
man,	1
Micaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imlah,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
I	1
hate	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
prophesy	1
good	1
concerning	1
me,	1
but	1
evil.	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
say	1
so.	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
called	1
an	1
officer,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hasten	1
hither	1
Micaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imlah.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
sat	1
each	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
having	1
put	1
on	1
their	1
robes,	1
in	1
a	1
void	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Chenaanah	1
made	1
him	1
horns	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
With	1
these	1
shalt	1
thou	1
push	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
until	1
thou	1
have	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
so,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
Ramothgilead,	1
and	1
prosper:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
hand.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
that	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
call	1
Micaiah	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
declare	1
good	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
one	1
mouth:	1
let	1
thy	1
word,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
22:15	1
So	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Micaiah,	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
against	1
Ramothgilead	1
to	1
battle,	1
or	1
shall	1
we	1
forbear?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
Go,	1
and	1
prosper:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
many	1
times	1
shall	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
tell	1
me	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
all	1
Israel	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
hills,	1
as	1
sheep	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
These	1
have	1
no	1
master:	1
let	1
them	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
22:18	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
prophesy	1
no	1
good	1
concerning	1
me,	1
but	1
evil?	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hear	1
thou	1
therefore	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD	1
sitting	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
standing	1
by	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Who	1
shall	1
persuade	1
Ahab,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
fall	1
at	1
Ramothgilead?	1
And	1
one	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
manner.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
forth	1
a	1
spirit,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
persuade	1
him.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherewith?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lying	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
persude	1
him,	1
and	1
prevail	1
also:	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
do	1
so.	1
	1
22:23	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
put	1
a	1
lying	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
evil	1
concerning	1
thee.	1
	1
22:24	1
But	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Chenaanah	1
went	1
near,	1
and	1
smote	1
Micaiah	1
on	1
the	1
cheek,	1
and	1
said,	1
Which	1
way	1
went	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
into	1
an	1
inner	1
chamber	1
to	1
hide	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:26	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Take	1
Micaiah,	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
back	1
unto	1
Amon	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
to	1
Joash	1
the	1
king's	1
son;	1
22:27	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Put	1
this	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
feed	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
of	1
affliction	1
and	1
with	1
water	1
of	1
affliction,	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
return	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
peace,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
spoken	1
by	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hearken,	1
O	1
people,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
22:29	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Ramothgilead.	1
	1
22:30	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
I	1
will	1
disguise	1
myself,	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
battle;	1
but	1
put	1
thou	1
on	1
thy	1
robes.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
22:31	1
But	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
commanded	1
his	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
captains	1
that	1
had	1
rule	1
over	1
his	1
chariots,	1
saying,	1
Fight	1
neither	1
with	1
small	1
nor	1
great,	1
save	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots	1
saw	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
that	1
they	1
said,	1
Surely	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
And	1
they	1
turned	1
aside	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
cried	1
out.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
pursuing	1
him.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
drew	1
a	1
bow	1
at	1
a	1
venture,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
between	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
the	1
harness:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
driver	1
of	1
his	1
chariot,	1
Turn	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
carry	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
wounded.	1
	1
22:35	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
increased	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
stayed	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and	1
died	1
at	1
even:	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
chariot.	1
	1
22:36	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
the	1
host	1
about	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
saying,	1
Every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
city,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
22:37	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
Samaria;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
	1
22:38	1
And	1
one	1
washed	1
the	1
chariot	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
and	1
the	1
dogs	1
licked	1
up	1
his	1
blood;	1
and	1
they	1
washed	1
his	1
armour;	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
22:39	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
the	1
ivory	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
made,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
that	1
he	1
built,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
22:40	1
So	1
Ahab	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
Ahaziah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
22:41	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asa	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:42	1
Jehoshaphat	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Azubah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Shilhi.	1
	1
22:43	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
Asa	1
his	1
father;	1
he	1
turned	1
not	1
aside	1
from	1
it,	1
doing	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
away;	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
offered	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
22:44	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:45	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
his	1
might	1
that	1
he	1
shewed,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
warred,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
22:46	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
sodomites,	1
which	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Asa,	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
22:47	1
There	1
was	1
then	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
Edom:	1
a	1
deputy	1
was	1
king.	1
	1
22:48	1
Jehoshaphat	1
made	1
ships	1
of	1
Tharshish	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Ophir	1
for	1
gold:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
not;	1
for	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
broken	1
at	1
Eziongeber.	1
	1
22:49	1
Then	1
said	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Let	1
my	1
servants	1
go	1
with	1
thy	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
ships.	1
But	1
Jehoshaphat	1
would	1
not.	1
	1
22:50	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
Jehoram	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
22:51	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
reigned	1
two	1
years	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:52	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin:	1
22:53	1
For	1
he	1
served	1
Baal,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
and	1
provoked	1
to	1
anger	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
Commonly	1
Called:	1
	1
The	1
Fourth	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Then	1
Moab	1
rebelled	1
against	1
Israel	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Ahab.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
Ahaziah	1
fell	1
down	1
through	1
a	1
lattice	1
in	1
his	1
upper	1
chamber	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
was	1
sick:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go,	1
enquire	1
of	1
Baalzebub	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
Ekron	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
recover	1
of	1
this	1
disease.	1
	1
1:3	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
Baalzebub	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
Ekron?	1
	1
1:4	1
Now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
that	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
up,	1
but	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
And	1
Elijah	1
departed.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
turned	1
back	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
now	1
turned	1
back?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
There	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
us,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
us,	1
Go,	1
turn	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
sent	1
you,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Israel,	1
that	1
thou	1
sendest	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
Baalzebub	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
Ekron?	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
that	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
up,	1
but	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
he	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
you,	1
and	1
told	1
you	1
these	1
words?	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
him,	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
hairy	1
man,	1
and	1
girt	1
with	1
a	1
girdle	1
of	1
leather	1
about	1
his	1
loins.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty	1
with	1
his	1
fifty.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
an	1
hill.	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
said,	1
Come	1
down.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
Elijah	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty,	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
then	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consume	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
fifty.	1
	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
fire	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consumed	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
fifty.	1
	1
1:11	1
Again	1
also	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
another	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty	1
with	1
his	1
fifty.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
thus	1
hath	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Come	1
down	1
quickly.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
Elijah	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
let	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consume	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
fifty.	1
And	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consumed	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
fifty.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
again	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
fifty	1
with	1
his	1
fifty.	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
captain	1
of	1
fifty	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
Elijah,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
these	1
fifty	1
thy	1
servants,	1
be	1
precious	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
1:14	1
Behold,	1
there	1
came	1
fire	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
burnt	1
up	1
the	1
two	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
fifties	1
with	1
their	1
fifties:	1
therefore	1
let	1
my	1
life	1
now	1
be	1
precious	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Elijah,	1
Go	1
down	1
with	1
him:	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
Baalzebub	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
Ekron,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
in	1
Israel	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
his	1
word?	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
off	1
that	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
up,	1
but	1
shalt	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
1:17	1
So	1
he	1
died	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
Elijah	1
had	1
spoken.	1
	1
And	1
Jehoram	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
son.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
take	1
up	1
Elijah	1
into	1
heaven	1
by	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
that	1
Elijah	1
went	1
with	1
Elisha	1
from	1
Gilgal.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
Tarry	1
here,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
Bethel.	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee.	1
So	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Bethel.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Bethel	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
Elisha,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
master	1
from	1
thy	1
head	1
to	1
day?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
know	1
it;	1
hold	1
ye	1
your	1
peace.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Elisha,	1
tarry	1
here,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
Jericho.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee.	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jericho.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Jericho	1
came	1
to	1
Elisha,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
master	1
from	1
thy	1
head	1
to	1
day?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Yea,	1
I	1
know	1
it;	1
hold	1
ye	1
your	1
peace.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tarry,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
here;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
Jordan.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee.	1
And	1
they	1
two	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
fifty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
went,	1
and	1
stood	1
to	1
view	1
afar	1
off:	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
stood	1
by	1
Jordan.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
Elijah	1
took	1
his	1
mantle,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
together,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
divided	1
hither	1
and	1
thither,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
two	1
went	1
over	1
on	1
dry	1
ground.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
over,	1
that	1
Elijah	1
said	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
Ask	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
for	1
thee,	1
before	1
I	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
thee.	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
let	1
a	1
double	1
portion	1
of	1
thy	1
spirit	1
be	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
asked	1
a	1
hard	1
thing:	1
nevertheless,	1
if	1
thou	1
see	1
me	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
taken	1
from	1
thee,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
unto	1
thee;	1
but	1
if	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
still	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
talked,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
horses	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
parted	1
them	1
both	1
asunder;	1
and	1
Elijah	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
Elisha	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
My	1
father,	1
my	1
father,	1
the	1
chariot	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen	1
thereof.	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
clothes,	1
and	1
rent	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
pieces.	1
	1
2:13	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
also	1
the	1
mantle	1
of	1
Elijah	1
that	1
fell	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
back,	1
and	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
Jordan;	1
2:14	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
mantle	1
of	1
Elijah	1
that	1
fell	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Elijah?	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
also	1
had	1
smitten	1
the	1
waters,	1
they	1
parted	1
hither	1
and	1
thither:	1
and	1
Elisha	1
went	1
over.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
view	1
at	1
Jericho	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
Elijah	1
doth	1
rest	1
on	1
Elisha.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
there	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
servants	1
fifty	1
strong	1
men;	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
seek	1
thy	1
master:	1
lest	1
peradventure	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
upon	1
some	1
mountain,	1
or	1
into	1
some	1
valley.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
send.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
urged	1
him	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed,	1
he	1
said,	1
Send.	1
They	1
sent	1
therefore	1
fifty	1
men;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
three	1
days,	1
but	1
found	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
tarried	1
at	1
Jericho,)	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Go	1
not?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
said	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
pleasant,	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
seeth:	1
but	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
naught,	1
and	1
the	1
ground	1
barren.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Bring	1
me	1
a	1
new	1
cruse,	1
and	1
put	1
salt	1
therein.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
and	1
cast	1
the	1
salt	1
in	1
there,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
healed	1
these	1
waters;	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
from	1
thence	1
any	1
more	1
death	1
or	1
barren	1
land.	1
	1
2:22	1
So	1
the	1
waters	1
were	1
healed	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Elisha	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
came	1
forth	1
little	1
children	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
up,	1
thou	1
bald	1
head;	1
go	1
up,	1
thou	1
bald	1
head.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
cursed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
forth	1
two	1
she	1
bears	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
tare	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
children	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
mount	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
reigned	1
twelve	1
years.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
he	1
wrought	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
not	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
like	1
his	1
mother:	1
for	1
he	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
3:3	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
cleaved	1
unto	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
which	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin;	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
therefrom.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Mesha	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
was	1
a	1
sheepmaster,	1
and	1
rendered	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
lambs,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
rams,	1
with	1
the	1
wool.	1
	1
3:5	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Ahab	1
was	1
dead,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
king	1
Jehoram	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Samaria	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
and	1
numbered	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
me:	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
against	1
Moab	1
to	1
battle?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
up:	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
thou	1
art,	1
my	1
people	1
as	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
my	1
horses	1
as	1
thy	1
horses.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Which	1
way	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
up?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
The	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom:	1
and	1
they	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass	1
of	1
seven	1
days'	1
journey:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cattle	1
that	1
followed	1
them.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Alas!	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
these	1
three	1
kings	1
together,	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moab!	1
3:11	1
But	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
here	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
him?	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel's	1
servants	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Here	1
is	1
Elisha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphat,	1
which	1
poured	1
water	1
on	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Elijah.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
him.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Nay:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
these	1
three	1
kings	1
together,	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moab.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
liveth,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
stand,	1
surely,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
regard	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
toward	1
thee,	1
nor	1
see	1
thee.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
now	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
minstrel.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
minstrel	1
played,	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Make	1
this	1
valley	1
full	1
of	1
ditches.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
wind,	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
rain;	1
yet	1
that	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
water,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
drink,	1
both	1
ye,	1
and	1
your	1
cattle,	1
and	1
your	1
beasts.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
Moabites	1
also	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
smite	1
every	1
fenced	1
city,	1
and	1
every	1
choice	1
city,	1
and	1
shall	1
fell	1
every	1
good	1
tree,	1
and	1
stop	1
all	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
mar	1
every	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
land	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
when	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
was	1
offered,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
water	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
Moabites	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
kings	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
them,	1
they	1
gathered	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
armour,	1
and	1
upward,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
border.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
upon	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
Moabites	1
saw	1
the	1
water	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
blood:	1
3:23	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
blood:	1
the	1
kings	1
are	1
surely	1
slain,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
smitten	1
one	1
another:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
Moab,	1
to	1
the	1
spoil.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
Israelites	1
rose	1
up	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
forward	1
smiting	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
even	1
in	1
their	1
country.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
they	1
beat	1
down	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
on	1
every	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
land	1
cast	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
stone,	1
and	1
filled	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
stopped	1
all	1
the	1
wells	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
felled	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
trees:	1
only	1
in	1
Kirharaseth	1
left	1
they	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof;	1
howbeit	1
the	1
slingers	1
went	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
it.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
too	1
sore	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
seven	1
hundred	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
swords,	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
3:27	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
eldest	1
son	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead,	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
upon	1
the	1
wall.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
indignation	1
against	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
there	1
cried	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
my	1
husband	1
is	1
dead;	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
thy	1
servant	1
did	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
creditor	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
unto	1
him	1
my	1
two	1
sons	1
to	1
be	1
bondmen.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
thee?	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
house?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Thine	1
handmaid	1
hath	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
save	1
a	1
pot	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
4:3	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
Go,	1
borrow	1
thee	1
vessels	1
abroad	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
neighbours,	1
even	1
empty	1
vessels;	1
borrow	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
come	1
in,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
thee	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
sons,	1
and	1
shalt	1
pour	1
out	1
into	1
all	1
those	1
vessels,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
set	1
aside	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
full.	1
	1
4:5	1
So	1
she	1
went	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
sons,	1
who	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
poured	1
out.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
vessels	1
were	1
full,	1
that	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
son,	1
Bring	1
me	1
yet	1
a	1
vessel.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
vessel	1
more.	1
And	1
the	1
oil	1
stayed.	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
she	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go,	1
sell	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
pay	1
thy	1
debt,	1
and	1
live	1
thou	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
Elisha	1
passed	1
to	1
Shunem,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
woman;	1
and	1
she	1
constrained	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
bread.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
turned	1
in	1
thither	1
to	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
husband,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
holy	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
passeth	1
by	1
us	1
continually.	1
	1
4:10	1
Let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
chamber,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
on	1
the	1
wall;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
set	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
stool,	1
and	1
a	1
candlestick:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
turn	1
in	1
thither.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
it	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
thither,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
chamber,	1
and	1
lay	1
there.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Gehazi	1
his	1
servant,	1
Call	1
this	1
Shunammite.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
her,	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
now	1
unto	1
her,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
careful	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
care;	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
thee?	1
wouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
spoken	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
I	1
dwell	1
among	1
mine	1
own	1
people.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
then	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
her?	1
And	1
Gehazi	1
answered,	1
Verily	1
she	1
hath	1
no	1
child,	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
is	1
old.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Call	1
her.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
her,	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
About	1
this	1
season,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
embrace	1
a	1
son.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
my	1
lord,	1
thou	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
do	1
not	1
lie	1
unto	1
thine	1
handmaid.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
that	1
Elisha	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
grown,	1
it	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
reapers.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
father,	1
My	1
head,	1
my	1
head.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
a	1
lad,	1
Carry	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
mother,	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
till	1
noon,	1
and	1
then	1
died.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
she	1
called	1
unto	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
said,	1
Send	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
asses,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
come	1
again.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
day?	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
new	1
moon,	1
nor	1
sabbath.	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
well.	1
	1
4:24	1
Then	1
she	1
saddled	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
servant,	1
Drive,	1
and	1
go	1
forward;	1
slack	1
not	1
thy	1
riding	1
for	1
me,	1
except	1
I	1
bid	1
thee.	1
	1
4:25	1
So	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
mount	1
Carmel.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
saw	1
her	1
afar	1
off,	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Gehazi	1
his	1
servant,	1
Behold,	1
yonder	1
is	1
that	1
Shunammite:	1
4:26	1
Run	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Is	1
it	1
well	1
with	1
thee?	1
is	1
it	1
well	1
with	1
thy	1
husband?	1
is	1
it	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
child?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
well:	1
4:27	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
hill,	1
she	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
feet:	1
but	1
Gehazi	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
thrust	1
her	1
away.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone;	1
for	1
her	1
soul	1
is	1
vexed	1
within	1
her:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
hid	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
hath	1
not	1
told	1
me.	1
	1
4:28	1
Then	1
she	1
said,	1
Did	1
I	1
desire	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
lord?	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
say,	1
Do	1
not	1
deceive	1
me?	1
	1
4:29	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Gehazi,	1
Gird	1
up	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
staff	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
if	1
thou	1
meet	1
any	1
man,	1
salute	1
him	1
not;	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
salute	1
thee,	1
answer	1
him	1
not	1
again:	1
and	1
lay	1
my	1
staff	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
and	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
Gehazi	1
passed	1
on	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
staff	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
child;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
voice,	1
nor	1
hearing.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
went	1
again	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
The	1
child	1
is	1
not	1
awaked.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
when	1
Elisha	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
behold,	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
laid	1
upon	1
his	1
bed.	1
	1
4:33	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
therefore,	1
and	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
upon	1
them	1
twain,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:34	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
mouth	1
upon	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
his	1
hands:	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
waxed	1
warm.	1
	1
4:35	1
Then	1
he	1
returned,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
and	1
fro;	1
and	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
sneezed	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
Gehazi,	1
and	1
said,	1
Call	1
this	1
Shunammite.	1
So	1
he	1
called	1
her.	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
4:37	1
Then	1
she	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
bowed	1
herself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
Elisha	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
Gilgal:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dearth	1
in	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
were	1
sitting	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servant,	1
Set	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
pot,	1
and	1
seethe	1
pottage	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
one	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
to	1
gather	1
herbs,	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
wild	1
vine,	1
and	1
gathered	1
thereof	1
wild	1
gourds	1
his	1
lap	1
full,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
shred	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
pot	1
of	1
pottage:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
4:40	1
So	1
they	1
poured	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
eating	1
of	1
the	1
pottage,	1
that	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
thou	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
pot.	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:41	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Then	1
bring	1
meal.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pot;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Pour	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
the	1
pot.	1
	1
4:42	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
Baalshalisha,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
firstfruits,	1
twenty	1
loaves	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
full	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
husk	1
thereof.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
4:43	1
And	1
his	1
servitor	1
said,	1
What,	1
should	1
I	1
set	1
this	1
before	1
an	1
hundred	1
men?	1
	1
He	1
said	1
again,	1
Give	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
They	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:44	1
So	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
left	1
thereof,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
Naaman,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
honourable,	1
because	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
deliverance	1
unto	1
Syria:	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
in	1
valour,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
leper.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
the	1
Syrians	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
by	1
companies,	1
and	1
had	1
brought	1
away	1
captive	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
little	1
maid;	1
and	1
she	1
waited	1
on	1
Naaman's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
mistress,	1
Would	1
God	1
my	1
lord	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Samaria!	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
recover	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
leprosy.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
one	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
his	1
lord,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
said	1
the	1
maid	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
said,	1
Go	1
to,	1
go,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
ten	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
ten	1
changes	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
letter	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
thee,	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
therewith	1
sent	1
Naaman	1
my	1
servant	1
to	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
recover	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
leprosy.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Am	1
I	1
God,	1
to	1
kill	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
alive,	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
doth	1
send	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
recover	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
leprosy?	1
wherefore	1
consider,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
seeketh	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
Elisha	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
that	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Wherefore	1
hast	1
thou	1
rent	1
thy	1
clothes?	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
now	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
prophet	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:9	1
So	1
Naaman	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
horses	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
chariot,	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Elisha.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
Elisha	1
sent	1
a	1
messenger	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
wash	1
in	1
Jordan	1
seven	1
times,	1
and	1
thy	1
flesh	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clean.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
Naaman	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
thought,	1
He	1
will	1
surely	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
stand,	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
strike	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
recover	1
the	1
leper.	1
	1
5:12	1
Are	1
not	1
Abana	1
and	1
Pharpar,	1
rivers	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
Israel?	1
may	1
I	1
not	1
wash	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
clean?	1
So	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
rage.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
father,	1
if	1
the	1
prophet	1
had	1
bid	1
thee	1
do	1
some	1
great	1
thing,	1
wouldest	1
thou	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it?	1
how	1
much	1
rather	1
then,	1
when	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
thee,	1
Wash,	1
and	1
be	1
clean?	1
	1
5:14	1
Then	1
went	1
he	1
down,	1
and	1
dipped	1
himself	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
Jordan,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
his	1
flesh	1
came	1
again	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
clean.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
company,	1
and	1
came,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
in	1
Israel:	1
now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
take	1
a	1
blessing	1
of	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
5:16	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
before	1
whom	1
I	1
stand,	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
none.	1
And	1
he	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
it;	1
but	1
he	1
refused.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
Naaman	1
said,	1
Shall	1
there	1
not	1
then,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
thy	1
servant	1
two	1
mules'	1
burden	1
of	1
earth?	1
for	1
thy	1
servant	1
will	1
henceforth	1
offer	1
neither	1
burnt	1
offering	1
nor	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
In	1
this	1
thing	1
the	1
LORD	1
pardon	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
master	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Rimmon	1
to	1
worship	1
there,	1
and	1
he	1
leaneth	1
on	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
I	1
bow	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Rimmon:	1
when	1
I	1
bow	1
down	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Rimmon,	1
the	1
LORD	1
pardon	1
thy	1
servant	1
in	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
in	1
peace.	1
So	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
way.	1
	1
5:20	1
But	1
Gehazi,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Elisha	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
my	1
master	1
hath	1
spared	1
Naaman	1
this	1
Syrian,	1
in	1
not	1
receiving	1
at	1
his	1
hands	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
brought:	1
but,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
I	1
will	1
run	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
take	1
somewhat	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:21	1
So	1
Gehazi	1
followed	1
after	1
Naaman.	1
And	1
when	1
Naaman	1
saw	1
him	1
running	1
after	1
him,	1
he	1
lighted	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
all	1
well?	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
All	1
is	1
well.	1
My	1
master	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
even	1
now	1
there	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
mount	1
Ephraim	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets:	1
give	1
them,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
two	1
changes	1
of	1
garments.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
Naaman	1
said,	1
Be	1
content,	1
take	1
two	1
talents.	1
And	1
he	1
urged	1
him,	1
and	1
bound	1
two	1
talents	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
two	1
bags,	1
with	1
two	1
changes	1
of	1
garments,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
upon	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
servants;	1
and	1
they	1
bare	1
them	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
tower,	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
bestowed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
he	1
let	1
the	1
men	1
go,	1
and	1
they	1
departed.	1
	1
5:25	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
his	1
master.	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
comest	1
thou,	1
Gehazi?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servant	1
went	1
no	1
whither.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Went	1
not	1
mine	1
heart	1
with	1
thee,	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
turned	1
again	1
from	1
his	1
chariot	1
to	1
meet	1
thee?	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
receive	1
money,	1
and	1
to	1
receive	1
garments,	1
and	1
oliveyards,	1
and	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
oxen,	1
and	1
menservants,	1
and	1
maidservants?	1
	1
5:27	1
The	1
leprosy	1
therefore	1
of	1
Naaman	1
shall	1
cleave	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
unto	1
thy	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
a	1
leper	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
said	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
Behold	1
now,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
dwell	1
with	1
thee	1
is	1
too	1
strait	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
6:2	1
Let	1
us	1
go,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
unto	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
take	1
thence	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
beam,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
us	1
a	1
place	1
there,	1
where	1
we	1
may	1
dwell.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Go	1
ye.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
one	1
said,	1
Be	1
content,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
thy	1
servants.	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
I	1
will	1
go.	1
	1
6:4	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jordan,	1
they	1
cut	1
down	1
wood.	1
	1
6:5	1
But	1
as	1
one	1
was	1
felling	1
a	1
beam,	1
the	1
axe	1
head	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
said,	1
Alas,	1
master!	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
borrowed.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
said,	1
Where	1
fell	1
it?	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
him	1
the	1
place.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
cut	1
down	1
a	1
stick,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
in	1
thither;	1
and	1
the	1
iron	1
did	1
swim.	1
	1
6:7	1
Therefore	1
said	1
he,	1
Take	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
	1
6:8	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
warred	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
his	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
In	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
camp.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Beware	1
that	1
thou	1
pass	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
place;	1
for	1
thither	1
the	1
Syrians	1
are	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
told	1
him	1
and	1
warned	1
him	1
of,	1
and	1
saved	1
himself	1
there,	1
not	1
once	1
nor	1
twice.	1
	1
6:11	1
Therefore	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
was	1
sore	1
troubled	1
for	1
this	1
thing;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Will	1
ye	1
not	1
shew	1
me	1
which	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
said,	1
None,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king:	1
but	1
Elisha,	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Israel,	1
telleth	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
thou	1
speakest	1
in	1
thy	1
bedchamber.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
spy	1
where	1
he	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
and	1
fetch	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
Dothan.	1
	1
6:14	1
Therefore	1
sent	1
he	1
thither	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
host:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
city	1
about.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
risen	1
early,	1
and	1
gone	1
forth,	1
behold,	1
an	1
host	1
compassed	1
the	1
city	1
both	1
with	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots.	1
And	1
his	1
servant	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Alas,	1
my	1
master!	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
Elisha	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
open	1
his	1
eyes,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
see.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
saw:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
mountain	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots	1
of	1
fire	1
round	1
about	1
Elisha.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
Elisha	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Smite	1
this	1
people,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
with	1
blindness.	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
blindness	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Elisha.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
way,	1
neither	1
is	1
this	1
the	1
city:	1
follow	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek.	1
But	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
Samaria,	1
that	1
Elisha	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
these	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
opened	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
they	1
saw;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Samaria.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Elisha,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
My	1
father,	1
shall	1
I	1
smite	1
them?	1
shall	1
I	1
smite	1
them?	1
	1
6:22	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
smite	1
them:	1
wouldest	1
thou	1
smite	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
captive	1
with	1
thy	1
sword	1
and	1
with	1
thy	1
bow?	1
set	1
bread	1
and	1
water	1
before	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
their	1
master.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
he	1
prepared	1
great	1
provision	1
for	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
master.	1
So	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
Syria	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Benhadad	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
gathered	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
and	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
besieged	1
Samaria.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
famine	1
in	1
Samaria:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
besieged	1
it,	1
until	1
an	1
ass's	1
head	1
was	1
sold	1
for	1
fourscore	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
cab	1
of	1
dove's	1
dung	1
for	1
five	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
6:26	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
passing	1
by	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
there	1
cried	1
a	1
woman	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Help,	1
my	1
lord,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
not	1
help	1
thee,	1
whence	1
shall	1
I	1
help	1
thee?	1
	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
barnfloor,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
winepress?	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
aileth	1
thee?	1
And	1
she	1
answered,	1
This	1
woman	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Give	1
thy	1
son,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat	1
him	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
eat	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
morrow.	1
	1
6:29	1
So	1
we	1
boiled	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
Give	1
thy	1
son,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat	1
him:	1
and	1
she	1
hath	1
hid	1
her	1
son.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes;	1
and	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
had	1
sackcloth	1
within	1
upon	1
his	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:31	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
God	1
do	1
so	1
and	1
more	1
also	1
to	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Elisha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphat	1
shall	1
stand	1
on	1
him	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
6:32	1
But	1
Elisha	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
sat	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
a	1
man	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
but	1
ere	1
the	1
messenger	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
elders,	1
See	1
ye	1
how	1
this	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
murderer	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
mine	1
head?	1
look,	1
when	1
the	1
messenger	1
cometh,	1
shut	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
hold	1
him	1
fast	1
at	1
the	1
door:	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
master's	1
feet	1
behind	1
him?	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
behold,	1
the	1
messenger	1
came	1
down	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
what	1
should	1
I	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
any	1
longer?	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
Elisha	1
said,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
To	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
shall	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
fine	1
flour	1
be	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
and	1
two	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Samaria.	1
	1
7:2	1
Then	1
a	1
lord	1
on	1
whose	1
hand	1
the	1
king	1
leaned	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
make	1
windows	1
in	1
heaven,	1
might	1
this	1
thing	1
be?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
leprous	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Why	1
sit	1
we	1
here	1
until	1
we	1
die?	1
	1
7:4	1
If	1
we	1
say,	1
We	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
then	1
the	1
famine	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
die	1
there:	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
sit	1
still	1
here,	1
we	1
die	1
also.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
fall	1
unto	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
if	1
they	1
save	1
us	1
alive,	1
we	1
shall	1
live;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
kill	1
us,	1
we	1
shall	1
but	1
die.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
Syria,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
there.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
chariots,	1
and	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
horses,	1
even	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
host:	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Lo,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
hired	1
against	1
us	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
to	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
7:7	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
arose	1
and	1
fled	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
left	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
their	1
asses,	1
even	1
the	1
camp	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
fled	1
for	1
their	1
life.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
lepers	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
camp,	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
one	1
tent,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
carried	1
thence	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hid	1
it;	1
and	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
another	1
tent,	1
and	1
carried	1
thence	1
also,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hid	1
it.	1
	1
7:9	1
Then	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
well:	1
this	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
good	1
tidings,	1
and	1
we	1
hold	1
our	1
peace:	1
if	1
we	1
tarry	1
till	1
the	1
morning	1
light,	1
some	1
mischief	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
us:	1
now	1
therefore	1
come,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
king's	1
household.	1
	1
7:10	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
porter	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
them,	1
saying,	1
We	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
there,	1
neither	1
voice	1
of	1
man,	1
but	1
horses	1
tied,	1
and	1
asses	1
tied,	1
and	1
the	1
tents	1
as	1
they	1
were.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
porters;	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
house	1
within.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
arose	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
shew	1
you	1
what	1
the	1
Syrians	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
us.	1
They	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
be	1
hungry;	1
therefore	1
are	1
they	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
to	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
saying,	1
When	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
we	1
shall	1
catch	1
them	1
alive,	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
some	1
take,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
that	1
remain,	1
which	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
(behold,	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
it:	1
behold,	1
I	1
say,	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
Israelites	1
that	1
are	1
consumed:)	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
send	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
7:14	1
They	1
took	1
therefore	1
two	1
chariot	1
horses;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
after	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
them	1
unto	1
Jordan:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
garments	1
and	1
vessels,	1
which	1
the	1
Syrians	1
had	1
cast	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
haste.	1
And	1
the	1
messengers	1
returned,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
spoiled	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians.	1
So	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
fine	1
flour	1
was	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
and	1
two	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
appointed	1
the	1
lord	1
on	1
whose	1
hand	1
he	1
leaned	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
gate:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
trode	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
he	1
died,	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
said,	1
who	1
spake	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Two	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
and	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
fine	1
flour	1
for	1
a	1
shekel,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
morrow	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
7:19	1
And	1
that	1
lord	1
answered	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
Now,	1
behold,	1
if	1
the	1
LORD	1
should	1
make	1
windows	1
in	1
heaven,	1
might	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
be?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
eat	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
fell	1
out	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
trode	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
8:1	1
Then	1
spake	1
Elisha	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
whose	1
son	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
to	1
life,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
thou	1
and	1
thine	1
household,	1
and	1
sojourn	1
wheresoever	1
thou	1
canst	1
sojourn:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
famine;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
also	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
land	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
arose,	1
and	1
did	1
after	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
household,	1
and	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
seven	1
years.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
seven	1
years'	1
end,	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
her	1
house	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
land.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
talked	1
with	1
Gehazi	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
things	1
that	1
Elisha	1
hath	1
done.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
the	1
king	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
to	1
life,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
the	1
woman,	1
whose	1
son	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
to	1
life,	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
for	1
her	1
house	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
land.	1
And	1
Gehazi	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
O	1
king,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
her	1
son,	1
whom	1
Elisha	1
restored	1
to	1
life.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
asked	1
the	1
woman,	1
she	1
told	1
him.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
appointed	1
unto	1
her	1
a	1
certain	1
officer,	1
saying,	1
Restore	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
hers,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
land,	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
Elisha	1
came	1
to	1
Damascus;	1
and	1
Benhadad	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
was	1
sick;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
The	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Hazael,	1
Take	1
a	1
present	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
go,	1
meet	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
recover	1
of	1
this	1
disease?	1
	1
8:9	1
So	1
Hazael	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
present	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
forty	1
camels'	1
burden,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
son	1
Benhadad	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
recover	1
of	1
this	1
disease?	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
mayest	1
certainly	1
recover:	1
howbeit	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
surely	1
die.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
he	1
settled	1
his	1
countenance	1
stedfastly,	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
wept.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
Hazael	1
said,	1
Why	1
weepeth	1
my	1
lord?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
Because	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
their	1
strong	1
holds	1
wilt	1
thou	1
set	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
their	1
young	1
men	1
wilt	1
thou	1
slay	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
wilt	1
dash	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
rip	1
up	1
their	1
women	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Hazael	1
said,	1
But	1
what,	1
is	1
thy	1
servant	1
a	1
dog,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
great	1
thing?	1
And	1
Elisha	1
answered,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Syria.	1
	1
8:14	1
So	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
Elisha,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
master;	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
What	1
said	1
Elisha	1
to	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
surely	1
recover.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
thick	1
cloth,	1
and	1
dipped	1
it	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
died:	1
and	1
Hazael	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
Joram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Jehoshaphat	1
being	1
then	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Je	1
hoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
8:17	1
Thirty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eight	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ahab	1
was	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:19	1
Yet	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
not	1
destroy	1
Judah	1
for	1
David	1
his	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
as	1
he	1
promised	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
alway	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
children.	1
	1
8:20	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
Edom	1
revolted	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
themselves.	1
	1
8:21	1
So	1
Joram	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Zair,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chariots	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Edomites	1
which	1
compassed	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
fled	1
into	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
8:22	1
Yet	1
Edom	1
revolted	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Judah	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
Then	1
Libnah	1
revolted	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Joram,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
Joram	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Ahaziah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
8:25	1
In	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year	1
of	1
Joram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoram	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
begin	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
8:26	1
Two	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
Ahaziah	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
one	1
year	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Athaliah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Omri	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
with	1
Joram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
against	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
in	1
Ramothgilead;	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
wounded	1
Joram.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
king	1
Joram	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
in	1
Jezreel	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
which	1
the	1
Syrians	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
at	1
Ramah,	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria.	1
And	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoram	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
Joram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
in	1
Jezreel,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
sick.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Elisha	1
the	1
prophet	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Gird	1
up	1
thy	1
loins,	1
and	1
take	1
this	1
box	1
of	1
oil	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Ramothgilead:	1
9:2	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
thither,	1
look	1
out	1
there	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nimshi,	1
and	1
go	1
in,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
arise	1
up	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
inner	1
chamber;	1
9:3	1
Then	1
take	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
pour	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
Then	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
flee,	1
and	1
tarry	1
not.	1
	1
9:4	1
So	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
even	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
the	1
prophet,	1
went	1
to	1
Ramothgilead.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
behold,	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
were	1
sitting;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
errand	1
to	1
thee,	1
O	1
captain.	1
And	1
Jehu	1
said,	1
Unto	1
which	1
of	1
all	1
us?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
To	1
thee,	1
O	1
captain.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
he	1
poured	1
the	1
oil	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
I	1
have	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab	1
thy	1
master,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
at	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jezebel.	1
	1
9:8	1
For	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab	1
shall	1
perish:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
Ahab	1
him	1
that	1
pisseth	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
in	1
Israel:	1
9:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baasha	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahijah:	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
dogs	1
shall	1
eat	1
Jezebel	1
in	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
bury	1
her.	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
9:11	1
Then	1
Jehu	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
his	1
lord:	1
and	1
one	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
all	1
well?	1
wherefore	1
came	1
this	1
mad	1
fellow	1
to	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
his	1
communication.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
false;	1
tell	1
us	1
now.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Thus	1
and	1
thus	1
spake	1
he	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
anointed	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
they	1
hasted,	1
and	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
blew	1
with	1
trumpets,	1
saying,	1
Jehu	1
is	1
king.	1
	1
9:14	1
So	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nimshi	1
conspired	1
against	1
Joram.	1
(Now	1
Joram	1
had	1
kept	1
Ramothgilead,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
Israel,	1
because	1
of	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
king	1
Joram	1
was	1
returned	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
in	1
Jezreel	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
which	1
the	1
Syrians	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
with	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria.)	1
	1
And	1
Jehu	1
said,	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
minds,	1
then	1
let	1
none	1
go	1
forth	1
nor	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
in	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
Jehu	1
rode	1
in	1
a	1
chariot,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Jezreel;	1
for	1
Joram	1
lay	1
there.	1
	1
And	1
Ahaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
Joram.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
watchman	1
on	1
the	1
tower	1
in	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
he	1
spied	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
Jehu	1
as	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
company.	1
And	1
Joram	1
said,	1
Take	1
an	1
horseman,	1
and	1
send	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
say,	1
Is	1
it	1
peace?	1
	1
9:18	1
So	1
there	1
went	1
one	1
on	1
horseback	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Is	1
it	1
peace?	1
And	1
Jehu	1
said,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
peace?	1
turn	1
thee	1
behind	1
me.	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
told,	1
saying,	1
The	1
messenger	1
came	1
to	1
them,	1
but	1
he	1
cometh	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
9:19	1
Then	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
second	1
on	1
horseback,	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Is	1
it	1
peace?	1
And	1
Jehu	1
answered,	1
What	1
hast	1
thou	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
peace?	1
turn	1
thee	1
behind	1
me.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
watchman	1
told,	1
saying,	1
He	1
came	1
even	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
cometh	1
not	1
again:	1
and	1
the	1
driving	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
driving	1
of	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nimshi;	1
for	1
he	1
driveth	1
furiously.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
Joram	1
said,	1
Make	1
ready.	1
And	1
his	1
chariot	1
was	1
made	1
ready.	1
And	1
Joram	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Ahaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
out,	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
chariot,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
Jehu,	1
and	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Joram	1
saw	1
Jehu,	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
peace,	1
Jehu?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
What	1
peace,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
whoredoms	1
of	1
thy	1
mother	1
Jezebel	1
and	1
her	1
witchcrafts	1
are	1
so	1
many?	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
Joram	1
turned	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
fled,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Ahaziah,	1
There	1
is	1
treachery,	1
O	1
Ahaziah.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
Jehu	1
drew	1
a	1
bow	1
with	1
his	1
full	1
strength,	1
and	1
smote	1
Jehoram	1
between	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
the	1
arrow	1
went	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
he	1
sunk	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
chariot.	1
	1
9:25	1
Then	1
said	1
Jehu	1
to	1
Bidkar	1
his	1
captain,	1
Take	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Naboth	1
the	1
Jezreelite:	1
for	1
remember	1
how	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
and	1
thou	1
rode	1
together	1
after	1
Ahab	1
his	1
father,	1
the	1
LORD	1
laid	1
this	1
burden	1
upon	1
him;	1
9:26	1
Surely	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
yesterday	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Naboth,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
requite	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
plat,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
take	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
plat	1
of	1
ground,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
when	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
saw	1
this,	1
he	1
fled	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
house.	1
And	1
Jehu	1
followed	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Smite	1
him	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
chariot.	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so	1
at	1
the	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Gur,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
Ibleam.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
fled	1
to	1
Megiddo,	1
and	1
died	1
there.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
carried	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
chariot	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
Joram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
began	1
Ahaziah	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Judah.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
when	1
Jehu	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jezreel,	1
Jezebel	1
heard	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
she	1
painted	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
tired	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
as	1
Jehu	1
entered	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
she	1
said,	1
Had	1
Zimri	1
peace,	1
who	1
slew	1
his	1
master?	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side?	1
	1
who?	1
And	1
there	1
looked	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
eunuchs.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Throw	1
her	1
down.	1
So	1
they	1
threw	1
her	1
down:	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
was	1
sprinkled	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
horses:	1
and	1
he	1
trode	1
her	1
under	1
foot.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go,	1
see	1
now	1
this	1
cursed	1
woman,	1
and	1
bury	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
king's	1
daughter.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
bury	1
her:	1
but	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
than	1
the	1
skull,	1
and	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
9:36	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
told	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
his	1
servant	1
Elijah	1
the	1
Tishbite,	1
saying,	1
In	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
Jezreel	1
shall	1
dogs	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
Jezebel:	1
9:37	1
And	1
the	1
carcase	1
of	1
Jezebel	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
dung	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
Jezreel;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
Jezebel.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
Ahab	1
had	1
seventy	1
sons	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
And	1
Jehu	1
wrote	1
letters,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Samaria,	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
Jezreel,	1
to	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
brought	1
up	1
Ahab's	1
children,	1
saying,	1
10:2	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
letter	1
cometh	1
to	1
you,	1
seeing	1
your	1
master's	1
sons	1
are	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
with	1
you	1
chariots	1
and	1
horses,	1
a	1
fenced	1
city	1
also,	1
and	1
armour;	1
10:3	1
Look	1
even	1
out	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
meetest	1
of	1
your	1
master's	1
sons,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
throne,	1
and	1
fight	1
for	1
your	1
master's	1
house.	1
	1
10:4	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
two	1
kings	1
stood	1
not	1
before	1
him:	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
we	1
stand?	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
city,	1
the	1
elders	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
bringers	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
children,	1
sent	1
to	1
Jehu,	1
saying,	1
We	1
are	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bid	1
us;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
king:	1
do	1
thou	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
10:6	1
Then	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
to	1
them,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
mine,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hearken	1
unto	1
my	1
voice,	1
take	1
ye	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
your	1
master's	1
sons,	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
Jezreel	1
by	1
to	1
morrow	1
this	1
time.	1
Now	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
being	1
seventy	1
persons,	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
up.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
letter	1
came	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
king's	1
sons,	1
and	1
slew	1
seventy	1
persons,	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
baskets,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
them	1
to	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
messenger,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
They	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
sons.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lay	1
ye	1
them	1
in	1
two	1
heaps	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
until	1
the	1
morning.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
be	1
righteous:	1
behold,	1
I	1
conspired	1
against	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
slew	1
him:	1
but	1
who	1
slew	1
all	1
these?	1
	1
10:10	1
Know	1
now	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
fall	1
unto	1
the	1
earth	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
his	1
servant	1
Elijah.	1
	1
10:11	1
So	1
Jehu	1
slew	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab	1
in	1
Jezreel,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
his	1
kinsfolks,	1
and	1
his	1
priests,	1
until	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
none	1
remaining.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
shearing	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
10:13	1
Jehu	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
are	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ahaziah;	1
and	1
we	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
salute	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
queen.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
them	1
alive.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
them	1
alive,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
the	1
shearing	1
house,	1
even	1
two	1
and	1
forty	1
men;	1
neither	1
left	1
he	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
thence,	1
he	1
lighted	1
on	1
Jehonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab	1
coming	1
to	1
meet	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
saluted	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
Is	1
thine	1
heart	1
right,	1
as	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
with	1
thy	1
heart?	1
And	1
Jehonadab	1
answered,	1
It	1
is.	1
If	1
it	1
be,	1
give	1
me	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
chariot.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
see	1
my	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
LORD.	1
So	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
ride	1
in	1
his	1
chariot.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Samaria,	1
he	1
slew	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
unto	1
Ahab	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
Elijah.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
Jehu	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ahab	1
served	1
Baal	1
a	1
little;	1
but	1
Jehu	1
shall	1
serve	1
him	1
much.	1
	1
10:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
call	1
unto	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
Baal,	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
priests;	1
let	1
none	1
be	1
wanting:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
Baal;	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
be	1
wanting,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
live.	1
But	1
Jehu	1
did	1
it	1
in	1
subtilty,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
the	1
worshippers	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
Jehu	1
said,	1
Proclaim	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly	1
for	1
Baal.	1
And	1
they	1
proclaimed	1
it.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
Jehu	1
sent	1
through	1
all	1
Israel:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
worshippers	1
of	1
Baal	1
came,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
left	1
that	1
came	1
not.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal	1
was	1
full	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
vestry,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
vestments	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
worshippers	1
of	1
Baal.	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
vestments.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jehu	1
went,	1
and	1
Jehonadab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Rechab,	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
worshippers	1
of	1
Baal,	1
Search,	1
and	1
look	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
here	1
with	1
you	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
the	1
worshippers	1
of	1
Baal	1
only.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
offer	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
Jehu	1
appointed	1
fourscore	1
men	1
without,	1
and	1
said,	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
escape,	1
he	1
that	1
letteth	1
him	1
go,	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
that	1
Jehu	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
guard	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
captains,	1
Go	1
in,	1
and	1
slay	1
them;	1
let	1
none	1
come	1
forth.	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword;	1
and	1
the	1
guard	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
cast	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
images	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
burned	1
them.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
they	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
draught	1
house	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
10:28	1
Thus	1
Jehu	1
destroyed	1
Baal	1
out	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:29	1
Howbeit	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin,	1
Jehu	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
after	1
them,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
golden	1
calves	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Dan.	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehu,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
well	1
in	1
executing	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hast	1
done	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
mine	1
heart,	1
thy	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation	1
shall	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:31	1
But	1
Jehu	1
took	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart:	1
for	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
which	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
10:32	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
began	1
to	1
cut	1
Israel	1
short:	1
and	1
Hazael	1
smote	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel;	1
10:33	1
From	1
Jordan	1
eastward,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Manassites,	1
from	1
Aroer,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Arnon,	1
even	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Bashan.	1
	1
10:34	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
Jehu	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers:	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
And	1
Jehoahaz	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Jehu	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
Athaliah	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
dead,	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
royal.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
Jehosheba,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
king	1
Joram,	1
sister	1
of	1
Ahaziah,	1
took	1
Joash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahaziah,	1
and	1
stole	1
him	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
which	1
were	1
slain;	1
and	1
they	1
hid	1
him,	1
even	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
nurse,	1
in	1
the	1
bedchamber	1
from	1
Athaliah,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
slain.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
her	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
six	1
years.	1
And	1
Athaliah	1
did	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
Jehoiada	1
sent	1
and	1
fetched	1
the	1
rulers	1
over	1
hundreds,	1
with	1
the	1
captains	1
and	1
the	1
guard,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
the	1
king's	1
son.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do;	1
A	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
enter	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house;	1
11:6	1
And	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Sur;	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
behind	1
the	1
guard:	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
keep	1
the	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
broken	1
down.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
two	1
parts	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
that	1
go	1
forth	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
about	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
compass	1
the	1
king	1
round	1
about,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
weapons	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
within	1
the	1
ranges,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
slain:	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
as	1
he	1
goeth	1
out	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
cometh	1
in.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
the	1
captains	1
over	1
the	1
hundreds	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
should	1
go	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
captains	1
over	1
hundreds	1
did	1
the	1
priest	1
give	1
king	1
David's	1
spears	1
and	1
shields,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
the	1
guard	1
stood,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
weapons	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
king,	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
king's	1
son,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
crown	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
testimony;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
king,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
clapped	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
when	1
Athaliah	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
looked,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
by	1
a	1
pillar,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
the	1
trumpeters	1
by	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
blew	1
with	1
trumpets:	1
and	1
Athaliah	1
rent	1
her	1
clothes,	1
and	1
cried,	1
Treason,	1
Treason.	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
commanded	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
hundreds,	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
her	1
forth	1
without	1
the	1
ranges:	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
followeth	1
her	1
kill	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
For	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
not	1
be	1
slain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
horses	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
she	1
slain.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
Jehoiada	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
between	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people;	1
between	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
brake	1
it	1
down;	1
his	1
altars	1
and	1
his	1
images	1
brake	1
they	1
in	1
pieces	1
thoroughly,	1
and	1
slew	1
Mattan	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Baal	1
before	1
the	1
altars.	1
And	1
the	1
priest	1
appointed	1
officers	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
rulers	1
over	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
guard,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
king	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kings.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
in	1
quiet:	1
and	1
they	1
slew	1
Athaliah	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
beside	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
	1
11:21	1
Seven	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
Jehoash	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
12:1	1
In	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Jehu	1
Jehoash	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
forty	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Zibiah	1
of	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
wherein	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
instructed	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
away:	1
the	1
people	1
still	1
sacrificed	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
All	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
dedicated	1
things	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
the	1
account,	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
set	1
at,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
cometh	1
into	1
any	1
man's	1
heart	1
to	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
12:5	1
Let	1
the	1
priests	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
repair	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
wheresoever	1
any	1
breach	1
shall	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
12:6	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Jehoash	1
the	1
priests	1
had	1
not	1
repaired	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
king	1
Jehoash	1
called	1
for	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
priests,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
repair	1
ye	1
not	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house?	1
now	1
therefore	1
receive	1
no	1
more	1
money	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintance,	1
but	1
deliver	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
consented	1
to	1
receive	1
no	1
more	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
neither	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
12:9	1
But	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
took	1
a	1
chest,	1
and	1
bored	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
beside	1
the	1
altar,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
as	1
one	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
put	1
therein	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
chest,	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
scribe	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
up	1
in	1
bags,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
the	1
money,	1
being	1
told,	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
work,	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
laid	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
carpenters	1
and	1
builders,	1
that	1
wrought	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
12:12	1
And	1
to	1
masons,	1
and	1
hewers	1
of	1
stone,	1
and	1
to	1
buy	1
timber	1
and	1
hewed	1
stone	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
laid	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
repair	1
it.	1
	1
12:13	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
bowls	1
of	1
silver,	1
snuffers,	1
basons,	1
trumpets,	1
any	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
12:14	1
But	1
they	1
gave	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
workmen,	1
and	1
repaired	1
therewith	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:15	1
Moreover	1
they	1
reckoned	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
men,	1
into	1
whose	1
hand	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
be	1
bestowed	1
on	1
workmen:	1
for	1
they	1
dealt	1
faithfully.	1
	1
12:16	1
The	1
trespass	1
money	1
and	1
sin	1
money	1
was	1
not	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
priests'.	1
	1
12:17	1
Then	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
fought	1
against	1
Gath,	1
and	1
took	1
it:	1
and	1
Hazael	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
hallowed	1
things	1
that	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
Jehoram,	1
and	1
Ahaziah,	1
his	1
fathers,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
had	1
dedicated,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
hallowed	1
things,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
gold	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Joash,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
12:20	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
arose,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
conspiracy,	1
and	1
slew	1
Joash	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Millo,	1
which	1
goeth	1
down	1
to	1
Silla.	1
	1
12:21	1
For	1
Jozachar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeath,	1
and	1
Jehozabad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shomer,	1
his	1
servants,	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
died;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Amaziah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
13:1	1
In	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
Joash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
Jehoahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehu	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
reigned	1
seventeen	1
years.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
which	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin;	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
therefrom.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Benhadad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hazael,	1
all	1
their	1
days.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
Jehoahaz	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
oppressed	1
them.	1
	1
13:5	1
(And	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
Israel	1
a	1
saviour,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
tents,	1
as	1
beforetime.	1
	1
13:6	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
sin,	1
but	1
walked	1
therein:	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
the	1
grove	1
also	1
in	1
Samaria.)	1
	1
13:7	1
Neither	1
did	1
he	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
Jehoahaz	1
but	1
fifty	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
ten	1
chariots,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
footmen;	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
had	1
destroyed	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
like	1
the	1
dust	1
by	1
threshing.	1
	1
13:8	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoahaz,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
Jehoahaz	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
Samaria:	1
and	1
Joash	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
13:10	1
In	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Jehoash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
sin:	1
but	1
he	1
walked	1
therein.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Joash,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might	1
wherewith	1
he	1
fought	1
against	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
Joash	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne:	1
and	1
Joash	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Samaria	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:14	1
Now	1
Elisha	1
was	1
fallen	1
sick	1
of	1
his	1
sickness	1
whereof	1
he	1
died.	1
And	1
Joash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
down	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
wept	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
father,	1
my	1
father,	1
the	1
chariot	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
horsemen	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
Elisha	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
bow	1
and	1
arrows.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Put	1
thine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
bow.	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
it:	1
and	1
Elisha	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
the	1
king's	1
hands.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Open	1
the	1
window	1
eastward.	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
it.	1
Then	1
Elisha	1
said,	1
Shoot.	1
And	1
he	1
shot.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
arrow	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
deliverance,	1
and	1
the	1
arrow	1
of	1
deliverance	1
from	1
Syria:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
the	1
Syrians	1
in	1
Aphek,	1
till	1
thou	1
have	1
consumed	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
the	1
arrows.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Smite	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
thrice,	1
and	1
stayed.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shouldest	1
have	1
smitten	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
times;	1
then	1
hadst	1
thou	1
smitten	1
Syria	1
till	1
thou	1
hadst	1
consumed	1
it:	1
whereas	1
now	1
thou	1
shalt	1
smite	1
Syria	1
but	1
thrice.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
Elisha	1
died,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites	1
invaded	1
the	1
land	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
burying	1
a	1
man,	1
that,	1
behold,	1
they	1
spied	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
the	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
Elisha:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
let	1
down,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
Elisha,	1
he	1
revived,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
13:22	1
But	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
oppressed	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoahaz.	1
	1
13:23	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
gracious	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
covenant	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
destroy	1
them,	1
neither	1
cast	1
he	1
them	1
from	1
his	1
presence	1
as	1
yet.	1
	1
13:24	1
So	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
died;	1
and	1
Benhadad	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
took	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Benhadad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hazael	1
the	1
cities,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
his	1
father	1
by	1
war.	1
Three	1
times	1
did	1
Joash	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
recovered	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:1	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Joash	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
reigned	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
14:2	1
He	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jehoaddan	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
yet	1
not	1
like	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
Joash	1
his	1
father	1
did.	1
	1
14:4	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
away:	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
kingdom	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
he	1
slew	1
his	1
servants	1
which	1
had	1
slain	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
14:6	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
murderers	1
he	1
slew	1
not:	1
according	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
wherein	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
The	1
fathers	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
the	1
children,	1
nor	1
the	1
children	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
the	1
fathers;	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sin.	1
	1
14:7	1
He	1
slew	1
of	1
Edom	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
salt	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
and	1
took	1
Selah	1
by	1
war,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
it	1
Joktheel	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
14:8	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Jehoash,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
son	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
look	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
to	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
The	1
thistle	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
cedar	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
saying,	1
Give	1
thy	1
daughter	1
to	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
wife:	1
and	1
there	1
passed	1
by	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
trode	1
down	1
the	1
thistle.	1
	1
14:10	1
Thou	1
hast	1
indeed	1
smitten	1
Edom,	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
hath	1
lifted	1
thee	1
up:	1
glory	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
tarry	1
at	1
home:	1
for	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
meddle	1
to	1
thy	1
hurt,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
fall,	1
even	1
thou,	1
and	1
Judah	1
with	1
thee?	1
14:11	1
But	1
Amaziah	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
Therefore	1
Jehoash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
looked	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
at	1
Bethshemesh,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
Judah	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
worse	1
before	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahaziah,	1
at	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
four	1
hundred	1
cubits.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
hostages,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
14:15	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoash	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
fought	1
with	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
Jehoash	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
Samaria	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
lived	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Jehoash	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Amaziah,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
14:19	1
Now	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
he	1
fled	1
to	1
Lachish;	1
but	1
they	1
sent	1
after	1
him	1
to	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
on	1
horses:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
buried	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
took	1
Azariah,	1
which	1
was	1
sixteen	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Amaziah.	1
	1
14:22	1
He	1
built	1
Elath,	1
and	1
restored	1
it	1
to	1
Judah,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
14:23	1
In	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
reigned	1
forty	1
and	1
one	1
years.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
14:25	1
He	1
restored	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
Hamath	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
the	1
plain,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
Jonah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amittai,	1
the	1
prophet,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Gathhepher.	1
	1
14:26	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
bitter:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
shut	1
up,	1
nor	1
any	1
left,	1
nor	1
any	1
helper	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
blot	1
out	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
under	1
heaven:	1
but	1
he	1
saved	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash.	1
	1
14:28	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
might,	1
how	1
he	1
warred,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
recovered	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
Hamath,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
Judah,	1
for	1
Israel,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
Jeroboam	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
Zachariah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:1	1
In	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
began	1
Azariah	1
son	1
of	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
15:2	1
Sixteen	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
two	1
and	1
fifty	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jecholiah	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
Amaziah	1
had	1
done;	1
15:4	1
Save	1
that	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
removed:	1
the	1
people	1
sacrificed	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
the	1
king,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
leper	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
several	1
house.	1
And	1
Jotham	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
judging	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Azariah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
15:7	1
So	1
Azariah	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Jotham	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:8	1
In	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
Azariah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
did	1
Zachariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
his	1
fathers	1
had	1
done:	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Zachariah,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:12	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
Jehu,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
sons	1
shall	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
15:13	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
nine	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
a	1
full	1
month	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
	1
15:14	1
For	1
Menahem	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gadi	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Tirzah,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
smote	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jabesh	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Shallum,	1
and	1
his	1
conspiracy	1
which	1
he	1
made,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:16	1
Then	1
Menahem	1
smote	1
Tiphsah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
therein,	1
and	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof	1
from	1
Tirzah:	1
because	1
they	1
opened	1
not	1
to	1
him,	1
therefore	1
he	1
smote	1
it;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
therein	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
child	1
he	1
ripped	1
up.	1
	1
15:17	1
In	1
the	1
nine	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
Azariah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Menahem	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gadi	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
reigned	1
ten	1
years	1
in	1
Samaria.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
15:19	1
And	1
Pul	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
against	1
the	1
land:	1
and	1
Menahem	1
gave	1
Pul	1
a	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
that	1
his	1
hand	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
kingdom	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
Menahem	1
exacted	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
wealth,	1
of	1
each	1
man	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
stayed	1
not	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Menahem,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel?	1
15:22	1
And	1
Menahem	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers;	1
and	1
Pekahiah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
15:23	1
In	1
the	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
of	1
Azariah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
Pekahiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Menahem	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
reigned	1
two	1
years.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
his,	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
with	1
Argob	1
and	1
Arieh,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
fifty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Gileadites:	1
and	1
he	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
room.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Pekahiah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:27	1
In	1
the	1
two	1
and	1
fiftieth	1
year	1
of	1
Azariah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Israel	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
years.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
15:29	1
In	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Pekah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
Tiglathpileser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
took	1
Ijon,	1
and	1
Abelbethmaachah,	1
and	1
Janoah,	1
and	1
Kedesh,	1
and	1
Hazor,	1
and	1
Gilead,	1
and	1
Galilee,	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Naphtali,	1
and	1
carried	1
them	1
captive	1
to	1
Assyria.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
Hoshea	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elah	1
made	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah,	1
and	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead,	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
Jotham	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uzziah.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Pekah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:32	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
began	1
Jotham	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
15:33	1
Five	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jerusha,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zadok.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
Uzziah	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
15:35	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
removed:	1
the	1
people	1
sacrificed	1
and	1
burned	1
incense	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
He	1
built	1
the	1
higher	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:36	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
15:37	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
LORD	1
began	1
to	1
send	1
against	1
Judah	1
Rezin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
Jotham	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
Ahaz	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
16:1	1
In	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
year	1
of	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
Ahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jotham	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
16:2	1
Twenty	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
Ahaz	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
like	1
David	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
16:3	1
But	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
yea,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree.	1
	1
16:5	1
Then	1
Rezin	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
and	1
Pekah	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
war:	1
and	1
they	1
besieged	1
Ahaz,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
overcome	1
him.	1
	1
16:6	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Rezin	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
recovered	1
Elath	1
to	1
Syria,	1
and	1
drave	1
the	1
Jews	1
from	1
Elath:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
came	1
to	1
Elath,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
16:7	1
So	1
Ahaz	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
Tiglathpileser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
servant	1
and	1
thy	1
son:	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
save	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
Ahaz	1
took	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
carried	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
it	1
captive	1
to	1
Kir,	1
and	1
slew	1
Rezin.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus	1
to	1
meet	1
Tiglathpileser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
saw	1
an	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
sent	1
to	1
Urijah	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
it,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
workmanship	1
thereof.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
Urijah	1
the	1
priest	1
built	1
an	1
altar	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
had	1
sent	1
from	1
Damascus:	1
so	1
Urijah	1
the	1
priest	1
made	1
it	1
against	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
came	1
from	1
Damascus.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
Damascus,	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
approached	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
offered	1
thereon.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
he	1
burnt	1
his	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
poured	1
his	1
drink	1
offering,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
also	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
commanded	1
Urijah	1
the	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
Upon	1
the	1
great	1
altar	1
burn	1
the	1
morning	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
burnt	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
his	1
meat	1
offering,	1
with	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
their	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
their	1
drink	1
offerings;	1
and	1
sprinkle	1
upon	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice:	1
and	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
enquire	1
by.	1
	1
16:16	1
Thus	1
did	1
Urijah	1
the	1
priest,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
commanded.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
the	1
bases,	1
and	1
removed	1
the	1
laver	1
from	1
off	1
them;	1
and	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
sea	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
brasen	1
oxen	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
of	1
stones.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
the	1
covert	1
for	1
the	1
sabbath	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
entry	1
without,	1
turned	1
he	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
16:19	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
Ahaz	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Hezekiah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
17:1	1
In	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
Hoshea	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elah	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
Samaria	1
over	1
Israel	1
nine	1
years.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
17:3	1
Against	1
him	1
came	1
up	1
Shalmaneser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
Hoshea	1
became	1
his	1
servant,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
presents.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
found	1
conspiracy	1
in	1
Hoshea:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
So	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
brought	1
no	1
present	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
year	1
by	1
year:	1
therefore	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
prison.	1
	1
17:5	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
up	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it	1
three	1
years.	1
	1
17:6	1
In	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
Hoshea	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
took	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
carried	1
Israel	1
away	1
into	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
Halah	1
and	1
in	1
Habor	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Gozan,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Medes.	1
	1
17:7	1
For	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
which	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
had	1
feared	1
other	1
gods,	1
17:8	1
And	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
secretly	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
right	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
built	1
them	1
high	1
places	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
cities,	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
watchmen	1
to	1
the	1
fenced	1
city.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
images	1
and	1
groves	1
in	1
every	1
high	1
hill,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree:	1
17:11	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
heathen	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
carried	1
away	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
wrought	1
wicked	1
things	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
anger:	1
17:12	1
For	1
they	1
served	1
idols,	1
whereof	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
17:13	1
Yet	1
the	1
LORD	1
testified	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
against	1
Judah,	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
seers,	1
saying,	1
Turn	1
ye	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
17:14	1
Notwithstanding	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
but	1
hardened	1
their	1
necks,	1
like	1
to	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
they	1
rejected	1
his	1
statutes,	1
and	1
his	1
covenant	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies	1
which	1
he	1
testified	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
vanity,	1
and	1
became	1
vain,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
them,	1
concerning	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
charged	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
do	1
like	1
them.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
they	1
left	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
molten	1
images,	1
even	1
two	1
calves,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grove,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
served	1
Baal.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
they	1
caused	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
daughters	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
used	1
divination	1
and	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
sold	1
themselves	1
to	1
do	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
17:18	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
very	1
angry	1
with	1
Israel,	1
and	1
removed	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight:	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
left	1
but	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Judah	1
only.	1
	1
17:19	1
Also	1
Judah	1
kept	1
not	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
but	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
Israel	1
which	1
they	1
made.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
rejected	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
afflicted	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
spoilers,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
17:21	1
For	1
he	1
rent	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat	1
king:	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
drave	1
Israel	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
sin	1
a	1
great	1
sin.	1
	1
17:22	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
which	1
he	1
did;	1
they	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
them;	1
17:23	1
Until	1
the	1
LORD	1
removed	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
by	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
So	1
was	1
Israel	1
carried	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
land	1
to	1
Assyria	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
brought	1
men	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
from	1
Cuthah,	1
and	1
from	1
Ava,	1
and	1
from	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
from	1
Sepharvaim,	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Samaria	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
they	1
possessed	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof.	1
	1
17:25	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
their	1
dwelling	1
there,	1
that	1
they	1
feared	1
not	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
lions	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
slew	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
17:26	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
saying,	1
The	1
nations	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
removed,	1
and	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
therefore	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
lions	1
among	1
them,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
slay	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
17:27	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Carry	1
thither	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
whom	1
ye	1
brought	1
from	1
thence;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
and	1
dwell	1
there,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
teach	1
them	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
17:28	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
Samaria	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
17:29	1
Howbeit	1
every	1
nation	1
made	1
gods	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
which	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
had	1
made,	1
every	1
nation	1
in	1
their	1
cities	1
wherein	1
they	1
dwelt.	1
	1
17:30	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon	1
made	1
Succothbenoth,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Cuth	1
made	1
Nergal,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Hamath	1
made	1
Ashima,	1
17:31	1
And	1
the	1
Avites	1
made	1
Nibhaz	1
and	1
Tartak,	1
and	1
the	1
Sepharvites	1
burnt	1
their	1
children	1
in	1
fire	1
to	1
Adrammelech	1
and	1
Anammelech,	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Sepharvaim.	1
	1
17:32	1
So	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
unto	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
lowest	1
of	1
them	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
which	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
17:33	1
They	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
their	1
own	1
gods,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
17:34	1
Unto	1
this	1
day	1
they	1
do	1
after	1
the	1
former	1
manners:	1
they	1
fear	1
not	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
after	1
their	1
statutes,	1
or	1
after	1
their	1
ordinances,	1
or	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
commandment	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
whom	1
he	1
named	1
Israel;	1
17:35	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
covenant,	1
and	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
other	1
gods,	1
nor	1
bow	1
yourselves	1
to	1
them,	1
nor	1
serve	1
them,	1
nor	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
them:	1
17:36	1
But	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
a	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm,	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
fear,	1
and	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
worship,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
17:37	1
And	1
the	1
statutes,	1
and	1
the	1
ordinances,	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment,	1
which	1
he	1
wrote	1
for	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
evermore;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
17:38	1
And	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
with	1
you	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
forget;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
fear	1
other	1
gods.	1
	1
17:39	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
ye	1
shall	1
fear;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
enemies.	1
	1
17:40	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hearken,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
after	1
their	1
former	1
manner.	1
	1
17:41	1
So	1
these	1
nations	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
served	1
their	1
graven	1
images,	1
both	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
children's	1
children:	1
as	1
did	1
their	1
fathers,	1
so	1
do	1
they	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
18:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Hoshea	1
son	1
of	1
Elah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
began	1
to	1
reign.	1
	1
18:2	1
Twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Abi,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zachariah.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
David	1
his	1
father	1
did.	1
	1
18:4	1
He	1
removed	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
brasen	1
serpent	1
that	1
Moses	1
had	1
made:	1
for	1
unto	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
burn	1
incense	1
to	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
Nehushtan.	1
	1
18:5	1
He	1
trusted	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
so	1
that	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
none	1
like	1
him	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
nor	1
any	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
18:6	1
For	1
he	1
clave	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
following	1
him,	1
but	1
kept	1
his	1
commandments,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Moses.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
prospered	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went	1
forth:	1
and	1
he	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
served	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
18:8	1
He	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
even	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
the	1
borders	1
thereof,	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
watchmen	1
to	1
the	1
fenced	1
city.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Hoshea	1
son	1
of	1
Elah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
Shalmaneser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
they	1
took	1
it:	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
Hezekiah,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
Hoshea	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Samaria	1
was	1
taken.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
did	1
carry	1
away	1
Israel	1
unto	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
Halah	1
and	1
in	1
Habor	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Gozan,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
Medes:	1
18:12	1
Because	1
they	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
but	1
transgressed	1
his	1
covenant,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
them,	1
nor	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
18:13	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
did	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
took	1
them.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
to	1
Lachish,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
offended;	1
return	1
from	1
me:	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
puttest	1
on	1
me	1
will	1
I	1
bear.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
appointed	1
unto	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
three	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
thirty	1
talents	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
gave	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
silver	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
	1
18:16	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
did	1
Hezekiah	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
gold	1
from	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
pillars	1
which	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
overlaid,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
sent	1
Tartan	1
and	1
Rabsaris	1
and	1
Rabshakeh	1
from	1
Lachish	1
to	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
host	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
up,	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
conduit	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
pool,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's	1
field.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asaph	1
the	1
recorder.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
Rabshakeh	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Speak	1
ye	1
now	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
What	1
confidence	1
is	1
this	1
wherein	1
thou	1
trustest?	1
	1
18:20	1
Thou	1
sayest,	1
(but	1
they	1
are	1
but	1
vain	1
words,)	1
I	1
have	1
counsel	1
and	1
strength	1
for	1
the	1
war.	1
Now	1
on	1
whom	1
dost	1
thou	1
trust,	1
that	1
thou	1
rebellest	1
against	1
me?	1
	1
18:21	1
Now,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
trustest	1
upon	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
this	1
bruised	1
reed,	1
even	1
upon	1
Egypt,	1
on	1
which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
lean,	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
pierce	1
it:	1
so	1
is	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
trust	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
18:22	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
We	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God:	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
he,	1
whose	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
whose	1
altars	1
Hezekiah	1
hath	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
hath	1
said	1
to	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
worship	1
before	1
this	1
altar	1
in	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
18:23	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
give	1
pledges	1
to	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
two	1
thousand	1
horses,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
able	1
on	1
thy	1
part	1
to	1
set	1
riders	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
18:24	1
How	1
then	1
wilt	1
thou	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
one	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
my	1
master's	1
servants,	1
and	1
put	1
thy	1
trust	1
on	1
Egypt	1
for	1
chariots	1
and	1
for	1
horsemen?	1
	1
18:25	1
Am	1
I	1
now	1
come	1
up	1
without	1
the	1
LORD	1
against	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
Go	1
up	1
against	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it.	1
	1
18:26	1
Then	1
said	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
and	1
Shebna,	1
and	1
Joah,	1
unto	1
Rabshakeh,	1
Speak,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
to	1
thy	1
servants	1
in	1
the	1
Syrian	1
language;	1
for	1
we	1
understand	1
it:	1
and	1
talk	1
not	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language	1
in	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
18:27	1
But	1
Rabshakeh	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hath	1
my	1
master	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
thy	1
master,	1
and	1
to	1
thee,	1
to	1
speak	1
these	1
words?	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
dung,	1
and	1
drink	1
their	1
own	1
piss	1
with	1
you?	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
Rabshakeh	1
stood	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
and	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
18:29	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
not	1
Hezekiah	1
deceive	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand:	1
18:30	1
Neither	1
let	1
Hezekiah	1
make	1
you	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
surely	1
deliver	1
us,	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
18:31	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
Make	1
an	1
agreement	1
with	1
me	1
by	1
a	1
present,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
eat	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
vine,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
drink	1
ye	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
his	1
cistern:	1
18:32	1
Until	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
land	1
like	1
your	1
own	1
land,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
vineyards,	1
a	1
land	1
of	1
oil	1
olive	1
and	1
of	1
honey,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live,	1
and	1
not	1
die:	1
and	1
hearken	1
not	1
unto	1
Hezekiah,	1
when	1
he	1
persuadeth	1
you,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
deliver	1
us.	1
	1
18:33	1
Hath	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
land	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria?	1
	1
18:34	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
of	1
Arpad?	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Sepharvaim,	1
Hena,	1
and	1
Ivah?	1
have	1
they	1
delivered	1
Samaria	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
18:35	1
Who	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
countries,	1
that	1
have	1
delivered	1
their	1
country	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
should	1
deliver	1
Jerusalem	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
18:36	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
him	1
not	1
a	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was,	1
saying,	1
Answer	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
18:37	1
Then	1
came	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Joah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asaph	1
the	1
recorder,	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
with	1
their	1
clothes	1
rent,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
covered	1
himself	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Eliakim,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
Shebna	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
to	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Hezekiah,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble,	1
and	1
of	1
rebuke,	1
and	1
blasphemy;	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
strength	1
to	1
bring	1
forth.	1
	1
19:4	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Rabshakeh,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
his	1
master	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
and	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
hath	1
heard:	1
wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
thy	1
prayer	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
are	1
left.	1
	1
19:5	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
king	1
Hezekiah	1
came	1
to	1
Isaiah.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
your	1
master,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
blasphemed	1
me.	1
	1
19:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
blast	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
rumour,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
19:8	1
So	1
Rabshakeh	1
returned,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
warring	1
against	1
Libnah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
from	1
Lachish.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
say	1
of	1
Tirhakah	1
king	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
thee:	1
he	1
sent	1
messengers	1
again	1
unto	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
19:10	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
speak	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
whom	1
thou	1
trustest	1
deceive	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
19:11	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
what	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
all	1
lands,	1
by	1
destroying	1
them	1
utterly:	1
and	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered?	1
19:12	1
Have	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
delivered	1
them	1
which	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
destroyed;	1
as	1
Gozan,	1
and	1
Haran,	1
and	1
Rezeph,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Eden	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Thelasar?	1
	1
19:13	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Arpad,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sepharvaim,	1
of	1
Hena,	1
and	1
Ivah?	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
received	1
the	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
read	1
it:	1
and	1
Hezekiah	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
spread	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
prayed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
dwellest	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
God,	1
even	1
thou	1
alone,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth.	1
	1
19:16	1
LORD,	1
bow	1
down	1
thine	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear:	1
open,	1
LORD,	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see:	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Sennacherib,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
reproach	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
19:17	1
Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
LORD,	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
nations	1
and	1
their	1
lands,	1
19:18	1
And	1
have	1
cast	1
their	1
gods	1
into	1
the	1
fire:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
gods,	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
men's	1
hands,	1
wood	1
and	1
stone:	1
therefore	1
they	1
have	1
destroyed	1
them.	1
	1
19:19	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
save	1
thou	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
even	1
thou	1
only.	1
	1
19:20	1
Then	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
sent	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
That	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prayed	1
to	1
me	1
against	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
I	1
have	1
heard.	1
	1
19:21	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
him;	1
The	1
virgin	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion	1
hath	1
despised	1
thee,	1
and	1
laughed	1
thee	1
to	1
scorn;	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
hath	1
shaken	1
her	1
head	1
at	1
thee.	1
	1
19:22	1
Whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
reproached	1
and	1
blasphemed?	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
hast	1
thou	1
exalted	1
thy	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
thine	1
eyes	1
on	1
high?	1
even	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:23	1
By	1
thy	1
messengers	1
thou	1
hast	1
reproached	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hast	1
said,	1
With	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
my	1
chariots	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
tall	1
cedar	1
trees	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
choice	1
fir	1
trees	1
thereof:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
lodgings	1
of	1
his	1
borders,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
his	1
Carmel.	1
	1
19:24	1
I	1
have	1
digged	1
and	1
drunk	1
strange	1
waters,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
my	1
feet	1
have	1
I	1
dried	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
besieged	1
places.	1
	1
19:25	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
heard	1
long	1
ago	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
it,	1
and	1
of	1
ancient	1
times	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
formed	1
it?	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
to	1
lay	1
waste	1
fenced	1
cities	1
into	1
ruinous	1
heaps.	1
	1
19:26	1
Therefore	1
their	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
of	1
small	1
power,	1
they	1
were	1
dismayed	1
and	1
confounded;	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
green	1
herb,	1
as	1
the	1
grass	1
on	1
the	1
house	1
tops,	1
and	1
as	1
corn	1
blasted	1
before	1
it	1
be	1
grown	1
up.	1
	1
19:27	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
abode,	1
and	1
thy	1
going	1
out,	1
and	1
thy	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
19:28	1
Because	1
thy	1
rage	1
against	1
me	1
and	1
thy	1
tumult	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
into	1
mine	1
ears,	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
hook	1
in	1
thy	1
nose,	1
and	1
my	1
bridle	1
in	1
thy	1
lips,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
thee	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
which	1
thou	1
camest.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
year	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
grow	1
of	1
themselves,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
that	1
which	1
springeth	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
sow	1
ye,	1
and	1
reap,	1
and	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
that	1
is	1
escaped	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
yet	1
again	1
take	1
root	1
downward,	1
and	1
bear	1
fruit	1
upward.	1
	1
19:31	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
mount	1
Zion:	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
do	1
this.	1
	1
19:32	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
nor	1
shoot	1
an	1
arrow	1
there,	1
nor	1
come	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
shield,	1
nor	1
cast	1
a	1
bank	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
19:33	1
By	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
came,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
city,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:34	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city,	1
to	1
save	1
it,	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
smote	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
Assyrians	1
an	1
hundred	1
fourscore	1
and	1
five	1
thousand:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
dead	1
corpses.	1
	1
19:36	1
So	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
returned,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Nineveh.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
worshipping	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nisroch	1
his	1
god,	1
that	1
Adrammelech	1
and	1
Sharezer	1
his	1
sons	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
and	1
they	1
escaped	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Armenia.	1
And	1
Esarhaddon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
20:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
was	1
Hezekiah	1
sick	1
unto	1
death.	1
And	1
the	1
prophet	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Set	1
thine	1
house	1
in	1
order;	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die,	1
and	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
20:3	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
remember	1
now	1
how	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
wept	1
sore.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
afore	1
Isaiah	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
court,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
20:5	1
Turn	1
again,	1
and	1
tell	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayer,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
tears:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
thee:	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
unto	1
thy	1
days	1
fifteen	1
years;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
and	1
this	1
city	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
defend	1
this	1
city	1
for	1
mine	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
servant	1
David's	1
sake.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said,	1
Take	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
figs.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
boil,	1
and	1
he	1
recovered.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
said	1
unto	1
Isaiah,	1
What	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
heal	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
third	1
day?	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said,	1
This	1
sign	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken:	1
shall	1
the	1
shadow	1
go	1
forward	1
ten	1
degrees,	1
or	1
go	1
back	1
ten	1
degrees?	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
light	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
shadow	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
ten	1
degrees:	1
nay,	1
but	1
let	1
the	1
shadow	1
return	1
backward	1
ten	1
degrees.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
shadow	1
ten	1
degrees	1
backward,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
dial	1
of	1
Ahaz.	1
	1
20:12	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Berodachbaladan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Baladan,	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
sent	1
letters	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
unto	1
Hezekiah:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Hezekiah	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
shewed	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
precious	1
things,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
spices,	1
and	1
the	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
treasures:	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
nor	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
dominion,	1
that	1
Hezekiah	1
shewed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
20:14	1
Then	1
came	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
king	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
said	1
these	1
men?	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
they	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
said,	1
They	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
even	1
from	1
Babylon.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
seen	1
in	1
thine	1
house?	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
answered,	1
All	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
have	1
they	1
seen:	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
among	1
my	1
treasures	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shewed	1
them.	1
	1
20:16	1
And	1
Isaiah	1
said	1
unto	1
Hezekiah,	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:17	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thy	1
fathers	1
have	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
Babylon:	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
left,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
of	1
thy	1
sons	1
that	1
shall	1
issue	1
from	1
thee,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beget,	1
shall	1
they	1
take	1
away;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
eunuchs	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
20:19	1
Then	1
said	1
Hezekiah	1
unto	1
Isaiah,	1
Good	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
good,	1
if	1
peace	1
and	1
truth	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
days?	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
pool,	1
and	1
a	1
conduit,	1
and	1
brought	1
water	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers:	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
21:1	1
Manasseh	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
fifty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Hephzibah.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:3	1
For	1
he	1
built	1
up	1
again	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
which	1
Hezekiah	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
destroyed;	1
and	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
altars	1
for	1
Baal,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grove,	1
as	1
did	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
worshipped	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
altars	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
In	1
Jerusalem	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
altars	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
son	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
observed	1
times,	1
and	1
used	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
dealt	1
with	1
familiar	1
spirits	1
and	1
wizards:	1
he	1
wrought	1
much	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
a	1
graven	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
grove	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
In	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
ever:	1
21:8	1
Neither	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Israel	1
move	1
any	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
their	1
fathers;	1
only	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
observe	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
them,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
my	1
servant	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
them.	1
	1
21:9	1
But	1
they	1
hearkened	1
not:	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
seduced	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
evil	1
than	1
did	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroyed	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
21:11	1
Because	1
Manasseh	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
hath	1
done	1
these	1
abominations,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
wickedly	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
Amorites	1
did,	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
Judah	1
also	1
to	1
sin	1
with	1
his	1
idols:	1
21:12	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
bringing	1
such	1
evil	1
upon	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
Judah,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
of	1
it,	1
both	1
his	1
ears	1
shall	1
tingle.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
stretch	1
over	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
the	1
plummet	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
wipe	1
Jerusalem	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
wipeth	1
a	1
dish,	1
wiping	1
it,	1
and	1
turning	1
it	1
upside	1
down.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
forsake	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
mine	1
inheritance,	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
prey	1
and	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
enemies;	1
21:15	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
have	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
anger,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
their	1
fathers	1
came	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
21:16	1
Moreover	1
Manasseh	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
very	1
much,	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
another;	1
beside	1
his	1
sin	1
wherewith	1
he	1
made	1
Judah	1
to	1
sin,	1
in	1
doing	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:17	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
his	1
sin	1
that	1
he	1
sinned,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
Manasseh	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Uzza:	1
and	1
Amon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
21:19	1
Amon	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
two	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Meshullemeth,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Haruz	1
of	1
Jotbah.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
Manasseh	1
did.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
walked	1
in,	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
idols	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
served,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
them:	1
21:22	1
And	1
he	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
walked	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Amon	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
slew	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
conspired	1
against	1
king	1
Amon;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
made	1
Josiah	1
his	1
son	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
21:25	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Amon	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Uzza:	1
and	1
Josiah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
22:1	1
Josiah	1
was	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
thirty	1
and	1
one	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jedidah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Adaiah	1
of	1
Boscath.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
turned	1
not	1
aside	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Josiah,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azaliah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Meshullam,	1
the	1
scribe,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
22:4	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sum	1
the	1
silver	1
which	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
have	1
gathered	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
22:5	1
And	1
let	1
them	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
22:6	1
Unto	1
carpenters,	1
and	1
builders,	1
and	1
masons,	1
and	1
to	1
buy	1
timber	1
and	1
hewn	1
stone	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
22:7	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reckoning	1
made	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
delivered	1
into	1
their	1
hand,	1
because	1
they	1
dealt	1
faithfully.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
said	1
unto	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Hilkiah	1
gave	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
he	1
read	1
it.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
king	1
word	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thy	1
servants	1
have	1
gathered	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
have	1
delivered	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
the	1
work,	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe	1
shewed	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
a	1
book.	1
And	1
Shaphan	1
read	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Achbor	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Michaiah,	1
and	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Asahiah	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
king's,	1
saying,	1
22:13	1
Go	1
ye,	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
Judah,	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
that	1
is	1
found:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
is	1
kindled	1
against	1
us,	1
because	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
book,	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written	1
concerning	1
us.	1
	1
22:14	1
So	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Ahikam,	1
and	1
Achbor,	1
and	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Asahiah,	1
went	1
unto	1
Huldah	1
the	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tikvah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Harhas,	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
wardrobe;	1
(now	1
she	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
college;)	1
and	1
they	1
communed	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Tell	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
me,	1
22:16	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
hath	1
read:	1
22:17	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
therefore	1
my	1
wrath	1
shall	1
be	1
kindled	1
against	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
22:18	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
which	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
to	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
As	1
touching	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard;	1
22:19	1
Because	1
thine	1
heart	1
was	1
tender,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
humbled	1
thyself	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
when	1
thou	1
heardest	1
what	1
I	1
spake	1
against	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
become	1
a	1
desolation	1
and	1
a	1
curse,	1
and	1
hast	1
rent	1
thy	1
clothes,	1
and	1
wept	1
before	1
me;	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
heard	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:20	1
Behold	1
therefore,	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
thee	1
unto	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
gathered	1
into	1
thy	1
grave	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
this	1
place.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
king	1
word	1
again.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
sent,	1
and	1
they	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great:	1
and	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
their	1
ears	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
by	1
a	1
pillar,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies	1
and	1
his	1
statutes	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
soul,	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
covenant	1
that	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
to	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
Baal,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
grove,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven:	1
and	1
he	1
burned	1
them	1
without	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Kidron,	1
and	1
carried	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
Bethel.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
idolatrous	1
priests,	1
whom	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
ordained	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
places	1
round	1
about	1
Jerusalem;	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
Baal,	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
planets,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
grove	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
without	1
Jerusalem,	1
unto	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron,	1
and	1
burned	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron,	1
and	1
stamped	1
it	1
small	1
to	1
powder,	1
and	1
cast	1
the	1
powder	1
thereof	1
upon	1
the	1
graves	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
sodomites,	1
that	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
where	1
the	1
women	1
wove	1
hangings	1
for	1
the	1
grove.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
all	1
the	1
priests	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
defiled	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
where	1
the	1
priests	1
had	1
burned	1
incense,	1
from	1
Geba	1
to	1
Beersheba,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
man's	1
left	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
23:9	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
came	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
among	1
their	1
brethren.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
he	1
defiled	1
Topheth,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
son	1
or	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
Molech.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
horses	1
that	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
by	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
Nathanmelech	1
the	1
chamberlain,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
suburbs,	1
and	1
burned	1
the	1
chariots	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
the	1
altars	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber	1
of	1
Ahaz,	1
which	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
altars	1
which	1
Manasseh	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
beat	1
down,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
down	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
cast	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
corruption,	1
which	1
Solomon	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
builded	1
for	1
Ashtoreth	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Zidonians,	1
and	1
for	1
Chemosh	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
and	1
for	1
Milcom	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
defile.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
he	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
filled	1
their	1
places	1
with	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
23:15	1
Moreover	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
which	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
made	1
Israel	1
to	1
sin,	1
had	1
made,	1
both	1
that	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
he	1
brake	1
down,	1
and	1
burned	1
the	1
high	1
place,	1
and	1
stamped	1
it	1
small	1
to	1
powder,	1
and	1
burned	1
the	1
grove.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
as	1
Josiah	1
turned	1
himself,	1
he	1
spied	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
that	1
were	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
sent,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchres,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
polluted	1
it,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
proclaimed,	1
who	1
proclaimed	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
What	1
title	1
is	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
see?	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
told	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Judah,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
against	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
Bethel.	1
	1
23:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
him	1
alone;	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
move	1
his	1
bones.	1
So	1
they	1
let	1
his	1
bones	1
alone,	1
with	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Samaria.	1
	1
23:19	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
made	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
anger,	1
Josiah	1
took	1
away,	1
and	1
did	1
to	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
acts	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
Bethel.	1
	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
that	1
were	1
there	1
upon	1
the	1
altars,	1
and	1
burned	1
men's	1
bones	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
this	1
covenant.	1
	1
23:22	1
Surely	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
holden	1
such	1
a	1
passover	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
judged	1
Israel,	1
nor	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah;	1
23:23	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Josiah,	1
wherein	1
this	1
passover	1
was	1
holden	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
23:24	1
Moreover	1
the	1
workers	1
with	1
familiar	1
spirits,	1
and	1
the	1
wizards,	1
and	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
the	1
idols,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
that	1
were	1
spied	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
did	1
Josiah	1
put	1
away,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
perform	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
that	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
like	1
unto	1
him	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
king	1
before	1
him,	1
that	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses;	1
neither	1
after	1
him	1
arose	1
there	1
any	1
like	1
him.	1
	1
23:26	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
wrath,	1
wherewith	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Judah,	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
provocations	1
that	1
Manasseh	1
had	1
provoked	1
him	1
withal.	1
	1
23:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
Judah	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
removed	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
cast	1
off	1
this	1
city	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
said,	1
My	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
there.	1
	1
23:28	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Josiah,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
23:29	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
Pharaohnechoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
went	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates:	1
and	1
king	1
Josiah	1
went	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
slew	1
him	1
at	1
Megiddo,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
carried	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
chariot	1
dead	1
from	1
Megiddo,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
sepulchre.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
took	1
Jehoahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
stead.	1
	1
23:31	1
Jehoahaz	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Hamutal,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
of	1
Libnah.	1
	1
23:32	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
fathers	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
Pharaohnechoh	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
bands	1
at	1
Riblah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hamath,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
reign	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
a	1
tribute	1
of	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
Pharaohnechoh	1
made	1
Eliakim	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
Josiah	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
Jehoiakim,	1
and	1
took	1
Jehoahaz	1
away:	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
died	1
there.	1
	1
23:35	1
And	1
Jehoiakim	1
gave	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
to	1
Pharaoh;	1
but	1
he	1
taxed	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
money	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Pharaoh:	1
he	1
exacted	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
taxation,	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
Pharaohnechoh.	1
	1
23:36	1
Jehoiakim	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign;	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eleven	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Zebudah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pedaiah	1
of	1
Rumah.	1
	1
23:37	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
fathers	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
24:1	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
Jehoiakim	1
became	1
his	1
servant	1
three	1
years:	1
then	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
rebelled	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
against	1
him	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
and	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
and	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
and	1
bands	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
against	1
Judah	1
to	1
destroy	1
it,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
24:3	1
Surely	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
this	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
to	1
remove	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight,	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did;	1
24:4	1
And	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood	1
that	1
he	1
shed:	1
for	1
he	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
innocent	1
blood;	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
not	1
pardon.	1
	1
24:5	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoiakim,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah?	1
24:6	1
So	1
Jehoiakim	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers:	1
and	1
Jehoiachin	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
24:7	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
came	1
not	1
again	1
any	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
land:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates	1
all	1
that	1
pertained	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
24:8	1
Jehoiachin	1
was	1
eighteen	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Nehushta,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Elnathan	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
24:10	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
besieged.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
against	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
did	1
besiege	1
it.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
Jehoiachin	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
his	1
officers:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
24:13	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
out	1
thence	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
which	1
Solomon	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
all	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
even	1
ten	1
thousand	1
captives,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
craftsmen	1
and	1
smiths:	1
none	1
remained,	1
save	1
the	1
poorest	1
sort	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
Jehoiachin	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
officers,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
those	1
carried	1
he	1
into	1
captivity	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
might,	1
even	1
seven	1
thousand,	1
and	1
craftsmen	1
and	1
smiths	1
a	1
thousand,	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
strong	1
and	1
apt	1
for	1
war,	1
even	1
them	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
brought	1
captive	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
made	1
Mattaniah	1
his	1
father's	1
brother	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
stead,	1
and	1
changed	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
Zedekiah.	1
	1
24:18	1
Zedekiah	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
one	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eleven	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Hamutal,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
of	1
Libnah.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
Jehoiakim	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
24:20	1
For	1
through	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
Judah,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
presence,	1
that	1
Zedekiah	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
25:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came,	1
he,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
host,	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
pitched	1
against	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
built	1
forts	1
against	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
besieged	1
unto	1
the	1
eleventh	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Zedekiah.	1
	1
25:3	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
ninth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
month	1
the	1
famine	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
bread	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
25:4	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
fled	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
between	1
two	1
walls,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
garden:	1
(now	1
the	1
Chaldees	1
were	1
against	1
the	1
city	1
round	1
about:)	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
the	1
way	1
toward	1
the	1
plain.	1
	1
25:5	1
And	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees	1
pursued	1
after	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
overtook	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
army	1
were	1
scattered	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
25:6	1
So	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Riblah;	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
judgment	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
they	1
slew	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zedekiah	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Zedekiah,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
fetters	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
came	1
Nebuzaradan,	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
unto	1
Jerusalem:	1
25:9	1
And	1
he	1
burnt	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
every	1
great	1
man's	1
house	1
burnt	1
he	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
25:11	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
fugitives	1
that	1
fell	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
did	1
Nebuzaradan	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
carry	1
away.	1
	1
25:12	1
But	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
be	1
vinedressers	1
and	1
husbandmen.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
brass	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
bases,	1
and	1
the	1
brasen	1
sea	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
did	1
the	1
Chaldees	1
break	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
carried	1
the	1
brass	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
the	1
pots,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
snuffers,	1
and	1
the	1
spoons,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass	1
wherewith	1
they	1
ministered,	1
took	1
they	1
away.	1
	1
25:15	1
And	1
the	1
firepans,	1
and	1
the	1
bowls,	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
gold,	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
in	1
silver,	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
away.	1
	1
25:16	1
The	1
two	1
pillars,	1
one	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
bases	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
brass	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
vessels	1
was	1
without	1
weight.	1
	1
25:17	1
The	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
pillar	1
was	1
eighteen	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
chapiter	1
upon	1
it	1
was	1
brass:	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
chapiter	1
three	1
cubits;	1
and	1
the	1
wreathen	1
work,	1
and	1
pomegranates	1
upon	1
the	1
chapiter	1
round	1
about,	1
all	1
of	1
brass:	1
and	1
like	1
unto	1
these	1
had	1
the	1
second	1
pillar	1
with	1
wreathen	1
work.	1
	1
25:18	1
And	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
chief	1
priest,	1
and	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
second	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
keepers	1
of	1
the	1
door:	1
25:19	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
took	1
an	1
officer	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
five	1
men	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
presence,	1
which	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
scribe	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
which	1
mustered	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
threescore	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
city:	1
25:20	1
And	1
Nebuzaradan	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
took	1
these,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
to	1
Riblah:	1
25:21	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
smote	1
them,	1
and	1
slew	1
them	1
at	1
Riblah	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hamath.	1
So	1
Judah	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
left,	1
even	1
over	1
them	1
he	1
made	1
Gedaliah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahikam,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
ruler.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
armies,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
men,	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
made	1
Gedaliah	1
governor,	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
Gedaliah	1
to	1
Mizpah,	1
even	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Careah,	1
and	1
Seraiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tanhumeth	1
the	1
Netophathite,	1
and	1
Jaazaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Maachathite,	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
men.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
Gedaliah	1
sware	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
men,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees:	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
25:25	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
that	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaniah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Elishama,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
royal,	1
came,	1
and	1
ten	1
men	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
Gedaliah,	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldees	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Mizpah.	1
	1
25:26	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
armies,	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees.	1
	1
25:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jehoiachin	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
seven	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
that	1
Evilmerodach	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
did	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Jehoiachin	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
out	1
of	1
prison;	1
25:28	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
kindly	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
throne	1
above	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
Babylon;	1
25:29	1
And	1
changed	1
his	1
prison	1
garments:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
bread	1
continually	1
before	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
his	1
allowance	1
was	1
a	1
continual	1
allowance	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
a	1
daily	1
rate	1
for	1
every	1

of	1
Shemaiah;	1
4:38	1
These	1
mentioned	1
by	1
their	1
names	1
were	1
princes	1
in	1
their	1
families:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
increased	1
greatly.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Gedor,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
to	1
seek	1
pasture	1
for	1
their	1
flocks.	1
	1
4:40	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
fat	1
pasture	1
and	1
good,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
wide,	1
and	1
quiet,	1
and	1
peaceable;	1
for	1
they	1
of	1
Ham	1
had	1
dwelt	1
there	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
these	1
written	1
by	1
name	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
smote	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
the	1
habitations	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
there,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
utterly	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
rooms:	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
pasture	1
there	1
for	1
their	1
flocks.	1
	1
4:42	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Simeon,	1
five	1
hundred	1
men,	1
went	1
to	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
having	1
for	1
their	1
captains	1
Pelatiah,	1
and	1
Neariah,	1
and	1
Rephaiah,	1
and	1
Uzziel,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ishi.	1
	1
4:43	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Amalekites	1
that	1
were	1
escaped,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
there	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Israel,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn;	1
but	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
defiled	1
his	1
father's	1
bed,	1
his	1
birthright	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
genealogy	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
reckoned	1
after	1
the	1
birthright.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
Judah	1
prevailed	1
above	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
came	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler;	1
but	1
the	1
birthright	1
was	1
Joseph's:)	1
5:3	1
The	1
sons,	1
I	1
say,	1
of	1
Reuben	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Israel	1
were,	1
Hanoch,	1
and	1
Pallu,	1
Hezron,	1
and	1
Carmi.	1
	1
5:4	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Joel;	1
Shemaiah	1
his	1
son,	1
Gog	1
his	1
son,	1
Shimei	1
his	1
son,	1
5:5	1
Micah	1
his	1

Reaia	1
his	1
son,	1
Baal	1
his	1
son,	1
5:6	1
Beerah	1
his	1
son,	1
whom	1
Tilgathpilneser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
carried	1
away	1
captive:	1
he	1
was	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
Reubenites.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
his	1
brethren	1
by	1
their	1
families,	1
when	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
their	1
generations	1
was	1
reckoned,	1
were	1
the	1
chief,	1
Jeiel,	1
and	1
Zechariah,	1
5:8	1
And	1
Bela	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azaz,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shema,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joel,	1
who	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Aroer,	1
even	1
unto	1
Nebo	1
and	1
Baalmeon:	1
5:9	1
And	1
eastward	1
he	1
inhabited	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates:	1
because	1
their	1
cattle	1
were	1
multiplied	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul	1
they	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Hagarites,	1
who	1
fell	1
by	1
their	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
tents	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
east	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Gad	1
dwelt	1
over	1
against	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Bashan	1
unto	1
Salcah:	1
5:12	1
Joel	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
Shapham	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
Jaanai,	1
and	1
Shaphat	1
in	1
Bashan.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
their	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
were,	1
Michael,	1
and	1
Meshullam,	1
and	1
Sheba,	1
and	1
Jorai,	1
and	1
Jachan,	1
and	1
Zia,	1
and	1
Heber,	1
seven.	1
	1
5:14	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abihail	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Huri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jaroah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Michael,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeshishai,	1
the	1

of	1
Jahdo,	1
the	1

of	1
Buz;	1
5:15	1
Ahi	1
the	1

of	1
Abdiel,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Guni,	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gilead	1
in	1
Bashan,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
towns,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
suburbs	1
of	1
Sharon,	1
upon	1
their	1
borders.	1
	1
5:17	1
All	1
these	1
were	1
reckoned	1
by	1
genealogies	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jotham	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:18	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Reuben,	1
and	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
of	1
valiant	1
men,	1
men	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
buckler	1
and	1
sword,	1
and	1
to	1
shoot	1
with	1
bow,	1
and	1
skilful	1
in	1
war,	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore,	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Hagarites,	1
with	1
Jetur,	1
and	1
Nephish,	1
and	1
Nodab.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
helped	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
Hagarites	1
were	1
delivered	1
into	1
their	1
hand,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them:	1
for	1
they	1
cried	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
them;	1
because	1
they	1
put	1
their	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
their	1
cattle;	1
of	1
their	1
camels	1
fifty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
of	1
sheep	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
of	1
asses	1
two	1
thousand,	1
and	1
of	1
men	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand.	1
	1
5:22	1
For	1
there	1
fell	1
down	1
many	1
slain,	1
because	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
they	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
steads	1
until	1
the	1
captivity.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
land:	1
they	1
increased	1
from	1
Bashan	1
unto	1
Baalhermon	1
and	1
Senir,	1
and	1
unto	1
mount	1
Hermon.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
even	1

famous	1
men,	1
and	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
they	1
transgressed	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
went	1
a	1
whoring	1
after	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
whom	1
God	1
destroyed	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Pul	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1

the	1

were	1
reckoned	1
by	1
their	1
genealogy	1
in	1
their	1
villages,	1
whom	1
David	1
and	1
Samuel	1
the	1
seer	1
did	1
ordain	1
in	1
their	1
set	1
office.	1
	1
9:23	1
So	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
had	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
namely,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
by	1
wards.	1
	1
9:24	1
In	1
four	1
quarters	1
were	1
the	1
porters,	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
west,	1
north,	1
and	1
south.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
their	1
brethren,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
villages,	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
after	1
seven	1
days	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:26	1
For	1
these	1
Levites,	1
the	1
four	1
chief	1
porters,	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
set	1
office,	1
and	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
chambers	1
and	1
treasuries	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
they	1
lodged	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
the	1
charge	1
was	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
opening	1
thereof	1
every	1
morning	1
pertained	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
ministering	1
vessels,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
by	1
tale.	1
	1
9:29	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
oversee	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
the	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
the	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
the	1
spices.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
made	1
the	1
ointment	1
of	1
the	1
spices.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
Mattithiah,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
Shallum	1
the	1
Korahite,	1
had	1
the	1
set	1
office	1
over	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
pans.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
brethren,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Kohathites,	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
to	1
prepare	1
it	1
every	1
sabbath.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
singers,	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
who	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
chambers	1
were	1
free:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
employed	1
in	1
that	1
work	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
9:34	1
These	1
chief	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
chief	1
throughout	1
their	1
generations;	1
these	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
in	1
Gibeon	1
dwelt	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
Jehiel,	1
whose	1
wife's	1
name	1
was	1
Maachah:	1
9:36	1
And	1
his	1
firstborn	1
son	1
Abdon,	1
then	1
Zur,	1
and	1
Kish,	1
and	1
Baal,	1
and	1
Ner,	1
and	1
Nadab.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Gedor,	1
and	1
Ahio,	1
and	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Mikloth.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
Mikloth	1
begat	1
Shimeam.	1
And	1
they	1
also	1
dwelt	1
with	1
their	1
brethren	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
over	1
against	1
their	1
brethren.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Ner	1
begat	1
Kish;	1
and	1
Kish	1
begat	1
Saul;	1
and	1
Saul	1
begat	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Malchishua,	1
and	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
Eshbaal.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jonathan	1
was	1
Meribbaal:	1
and	1
Meribbaal	1
begat	1
Micah.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Micah	1
were,	1
Pithon,	1
and	1
Melech,	1
and	1
Tahrea,	1
and	1
Ahaz.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
Ahaz	1
begat	1
Jarah;	1
and	1
Jarah	1
begat	1
Alemeth,	1
and	1
Azmaveth,	1
and	1
Zimri;	1
and	1
Zimri	1
begat	1
Moza;	1
9:43	1
And	1
Moza	1
begat	1
Binea;	1
and	1
Rephaiah	1
his	1
son,	1
Eleasah	1
his	1
son,	1
Azel	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
9:44	1
And	1
Azel	1
had	1
six	1
sons,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
these,	1
Azrikam,	1
Bocheru,	1
and	1
Ishmael,	1
and	1
Sheariah,	1
and	1
Obadiah,	1
and	1
Hanan:	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Azel.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Philistines	1
fought	1
against	1
Israel;	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
slain	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
followed	1
hard	1
after	1
Saul,	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
sons;	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
slew	1
Jonathan,	1
and	1
Abinadab,	1
and	1
Malchishua,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
went	1
sore	1
against	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
archers	1
hit	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
wounded	1
of	1
the	1
archers.	1
	1
10:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Saul	1
to	1
his	1
armourbearer,	1
Draw	1
thy	1
sword,	1
and	1
thrust	1
me	1
through	1
therewith;	1
lest	1
these	1
uncircumcised	1
come	1
and	1
abuse	1
me.	1
But	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
would	1
not;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
So	1
Saul	1
took	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
armourbearer	1
saw	1
that	1
Saul	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
fell	1
likewise	1
on	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
died.	1
	1
10:6	1
So	1
Saul	1
died,	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house	1
died	1
together.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
fled,	1
and	1
that	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
dead,	1
then	1
they	1
forsook	1
their	1
cities,	1
and	1
fled:	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
to	1
strip	1
the	1
slain,	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
Saul	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
fallen	1
in	1
mount	1
Gilboa.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
stripped	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
round	1
about,	1
to	1
carry	1
tidings	1
unto	1
their	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
gods,	1
and	1
fastened	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Dagon.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
Jabeshgilead	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
Philistines	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
Saul,	1
10:12	1
They	1
arose,	1
all	1
the	1
valiant	1
men,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Saul,	1
and	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
buried	1
their	1
bones	1
under	1
the	1
oak	1
in	1
Jabesh,	1
and	1
fasted	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
10:13	1
So	1
Saul	1
died	1
for	1
his	1
transgression	1
which	1
he	1
committed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
against	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
kept	1
not,	1
and	1
also	1
for	1
asking	1
counsel	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
it;	1
10:14	1
And	1
enquired	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
he	1
slew	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse.	1
	1
11:1	1
Then	1
all	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
to	1
David	1
unto	1
Hebron,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
are	1
thy	1
bone	1
and	1
thy	1
flesh.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
moreover	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
even	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
king,	1
thou	1
wast	1
he	1
that	1
leddest	1
out	1
and	1
broughtest	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
feed	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
ruler	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:3	1
Therefore	1
came	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
Hebron;	1
and	1
David	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
Hebron	1
before	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
anointed	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Samuel.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
Jebus;	1
where	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
were,	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jebus	1
said	1
to	1
David,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
come	1
hither.	1
Nevertheless	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
Zion,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Whosoever	1
smiteth	1
the	1
Jebusites	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
chief	1
and	1
captain.	1
So	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
went	1
first	1
up,	1
and	1
was	1
chief.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
David	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
castle;	1
therefore	1
they	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
the	1
city	1
round	1
about,	1
even	1
from	1
Millo	1
round	1
about:	1
and	1
Joab	1
repaired	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:9	1
So	1
David	1
waxed	1
greater	1
and	1
greater:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:10	1
These	1
also	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
whom	1
David	1
had,	1
who	1
strengthened	1
themselves	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
Israel,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
king,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
whom	1
David	1
had;	1
Jashobeam,	1
an	1
Hachmonite,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
captains:	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
spear	1
against	1
three	1
hundred	1
slain	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
after	1
him	1
was	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Dodo,	1
the	1
Ahohite,	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
mighties.	1
	1
11:13	1
He	1
was	1
with	1
David	1
at	1
Pasdammim,	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
Philistines	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
battle,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
ground	1
full	1
of	1
barley;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
parcel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
it,	1
and	1
slew	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
deliverance.	1
	1
11:15	1
Now	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
thirty	1
captains	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
rock	1
to	1
David,	1
into	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Adullam;	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
encamped	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
hold,	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines'	1
garrison	1
was	1
then	1
at	1
Bethlehem.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
David	1
longed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Oh	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
gate!	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
three	1
brake	1
through	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
drew	1
water	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
well	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
David:	1
but	1
David	1
would	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
poured	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
said,	1
My	1
God	1
forbid	1
it	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing:	1
shall	1
I	1
drink	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
that	1
have	1
put	1
their	1
lives	1
in	1
jeopardy?	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
they	1
brought	1
it.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink	1
it.	1
	1
These	1
things	1
did	1
these	1
three	1
mightiest.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
Abishai	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Joab,	1
he	1
was	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
three:	1
for	1
lifting	1
up	1
his	1
spear	1
against	1
three	1
hundred,	1
he	1
slew	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
three.	1
	1
11:21	1
Of	1
the	1
three,	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
the	1
two;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
their	1
captain:	1
howbeit	1
he	1
attained	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
three.	1
	1
11:22	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
valiant	1
man	1
of	1
Kabzeel,	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
many	1
acts;	1
he	1
slew	1
two	1
lionlike	1
men	1
of	1
Moab:	1
also	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
and	1
slew	1
a	1
lion	1
in	1
a	1
pit	1
in	1
a	1
snowy	1
day.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
he	1
slew	1
an	1
Egyptian,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
stature,	1
five	1
cubits	1
high;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Egyptian's	1
hand	1
was	1
a	1
spear	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
staff,	1
and	1
plucked	1
the	1
spear	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptian's	1
hand,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
spear.	1
	1
11:24	1
These	1
things	1
did	1

the	1
son	1

Jehoiada,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1

	1
11:25	1
Behold,	1
he	1
was	1
honourable	1
among	1
the	1
thirty,	1
but	1
attained	1
not	1

	1
12:2	1
They	1

And	1
of	1

there	1
separated	1
themselves	1
unto	1
David	1
into	1
the	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness	1
men	1
of	1
might,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
battle,	1
that	1
could	1
handle	1
shield	1
and	1
buckler,	1
whose	1
faces	1
were	1
like	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
lions,	1
and	1
were	1
as	1
swift	1
as	1
the	1
roes	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains;	1

	1
12:14	1
These	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gad,	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host:	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
was	1
over	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
the	1
greatest	1
over	1
a	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:15	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
over	1
Jordan	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
overflown	1
all	1
his	1
banks;	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
to	1
flight	1
all	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
valleys,	1
both	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
west.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
and	1
Judah	1
to	1
the	1
hold	1
unto	1
David.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
peaceably	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
help	1
me,	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
knit	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
come	1
to	1
betray	1
me	1
to	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
seeing	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
wrong	1
in	1
mine	1
hands,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
look	1
thereon,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
it.	1
	1
12:18	1
Then	1
the	1
spirit	1
came	1
upon	1
Amasai,	1
who	1
was	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
captains,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Thine	1
are	1
we,	1
David,	1
and	1
on	1
thy	1
side,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse:	1
peace,	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
to	1
thine	1
helpers;	1
for	1
thy	1
God	1
helpeth	1
thee.	1
	1
Then	1
David	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
band.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
some	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
to	1
David,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines	1
against	1
Saul	1
to	1
battle:	1
but	1
they	1
helped	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
upon	1
advisement	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
He	1
will	1
fall	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
Saul	1
to	1
the	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
our	1
heads.	1
	1
12:20	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Ziklag,	1
there	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
Adnah,	1
and	1
Jozabad,	1
and	1
Jediael,	1
and	1
Michael,	1
and	1
Jozabad,	1
and	1
Elihu,	1
and	1
Zilthai,	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
thousands	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
Manasseh.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
they	1
helped	1
David	1
against	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
the	1
rovers:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
were	1
captains	1
in	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
12:22	1
For	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
host,	1
like	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
bands	1
that	1
were	1
ready	1
armed	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
David	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Saul	1
to	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:24	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
that	1
bare	1
shield	1
and	1
spear	1
were	1
six	1
thousand	1
and	1
eight	1
hundred,	1
ready	1
armed	1
to	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
12:25	1
Of	1

And	1

of	1
the	1

and	1
with	1
him	1
were	1

12:29	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
Saul,	1
three	1
thousand:	1
for	1
hitherto	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
ward	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1

	1
12:30	1
And	1

twenty	1

famous	1
throughout	1

	1
12:31	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
eighteen	1
thousand,	1
which	1
were	1
expressed	1
by	1
name,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
make	1
David	1
king.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Issachar,	1
which	1
were	1
men	1
that	1
had	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
times,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Israel	1
ought	1
to	1
do;	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
two	1
hundred;	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
brethren	1
were	1
at	1
their	1
commandment.	1
	1
12:33	1
Of	1
Zebulun,	1
such	1
as	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
battle,	1
expert	1
in	1
war,	1
with	1
all	1
instruments	1
of	1
war,	1
fifty	1
thousand,	1
which	1
could	1
keep	1
rank:	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
double	1
heart.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
of	1
Naphtali	1
a	1
thousand	1
captains,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
with	1

and	1
seven	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1

and	1
six	1

	1
12:36	1
And	1
of	1

such	1
as	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
battle,	1
expert	1
in	1
war,	1
forty	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:37	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
of	1
the	1
Reubenites,	1
and	1
the	1
Gadites,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
half	1

with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1

war	1
for	1
the	1
battle,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
	1
12:38	1
All	1
these	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
that	1
could	1
keep	1
rank,	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart	1
to	1
Hebron,	1
to	1
make	1
David	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
also	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
heart	1
to	1
make	1
David	1
king.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
with	1
David	1
three	1
days,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking:	1
for	1
their	1
brethren	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
12:40	1
Moreover	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
nigh	1
them,	1
even	1
unto	1
Issachar	1
and	1
Zebulun	1
and	1
Naphtali,	1
brought	1
bread	1
on	1
asses,	1

oxen,	1
and	1
sheep	1
abundantly:	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
joy	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
David	1
consulted	1
with	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
with	1
every	1
leader.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
If	1
it	1
seem	1
good	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
let	1
us	1
send	1
abroad	1
unto	1
our	1
brethren	1
every	1
where,	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
cities	1
and	1
suburbs,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
gather	1
themselves	1
unto	1
us:	1
13:3	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
enquired	1
not	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Saul.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
so:	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:5	1
So	1
David	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together,	1
from	1
Shihor	1
of	1
Egypt	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
Hemath,	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
Kirjathjearim.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel,	1
to	1
Baalah,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
Kirjathjearim,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
Judah,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
thence	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
between	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
they	1
carried	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
cart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Abinadab:	1
and	1
Uzza	1
and	1
Ahio	1
drave	1
the	1
cart.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
played	1
before	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
might,	1
and	1
with	1
singing,	1
and	1
with	1
harps,	1
and	1
with	1
psalteries,	1
and	1
with	1
timbrels,	1
and	1
with	1
cymbals,	1
and	1
with	1
trumpets.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Chidon,	1
Uzza	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
ark;	1
for	1
the	1
oxen	1
stumbled.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Uzza,	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
ark:	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
died	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
displeased,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
upon	1
Uzza:	1
wherefore	1
that	1
place	1
is	1
called	1
Perezuzza	1
to	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
day,	1
saying,	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
bring	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
home	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
13:13	1
So	1
David	1
brought	1
not	1
the	1
ark	1
home	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
but	1
carried	1
it	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
the	1
Gittite.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
remained	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Obededom	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
blessed	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
14:1	1
Now	1
Hiram	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
timber	1
of	1
cedars,	1
with	1
masons	1
and	1
carpenters,	1
to	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
David	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
confirmed	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
Israel,	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
more	1
wives	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
David	1
begat	1
more	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters.	1
	1
14:4	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
Shammua,	1
and	1
Shobab,	1
Nathan,	1
and	1
Solomon,	1
14:5	1
And	1
Ibhar,	1
and	1
Elishua,	1
and	1
Elpalet,	1
14:6	1
And	1
Nogah,	1
and	1
Nepheg,	1
and	1
Japhia,	1
14:7	1
And	1
Elishama,	1
and	1
Beeliada,	1
and	1
Eliphalet.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Philistines	1
heard	1
that	1
David	1
was	1
anointed	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel,	1
all	1
the	1
Philistines	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
seek	1
David.	1
And	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
came	1
and	1
spread	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Rephaim.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
David	1
enquired	1
of	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines?	1
And	1
wilt	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
mine	1
hand?	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
up;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
14:11	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Baalperazim;	1
and	1
David	1
smote	1
them	1
there.	1
Then	1
David	1
said,	1
God	1
hath	1
broken	1
in	1
upon	1
mine	1
enemies	1
by	1
mine	1
hand	1
like	1
the	1
breaking	1
forth	1
of	1
waters:	1
therefore	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
Baalperazim.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
their	1
gods	1
there,	1
David	1
gave	1
a	1
commandment,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
burned	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
the	1
Philistines	1
yet	1
again	1
spread	1
themselves	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
	1
14:14	1
Therefore	1
David	1
enquired	1
again	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
not	1
up	1
after	1
them;	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mulberry	1
trees,	1
that	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
gone	1
forth	1
before	1
thee	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
14:16	1
David	1
therefore	1
did	1
as	1
God	1
commanded	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Gibeon	1
even	1
to	1
Gazer.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
David	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
all	1
lands;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
upon	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
David	1
made	1
him	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
prepared	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
pitched	1
for	1
it	1
a	1
tent.	1
	1
15:2	1
Then	1
David	1
said,	1
None	1
ought	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
but	1
the	1
Levites:	1
for	1
them	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
chosen	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
David	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel	1
together	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
his	1
place,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
David	1
assembled	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites:	1
15:5	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Kohath;	1
Uriel	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty:	1
15:6	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari;	1
Asaiah	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty:	1
15:7	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gershom;	1
Joel	1
the	1
chief	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty:	1
15:8	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Elizaphan;	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
two	1
hundred:	1
15:9	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Hebron;	1
Eliel	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
fourscore:	1
15:10	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Uzziel;	1
Amminadab	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twelve.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
David	1
called	1
for	1
Zadok	1
and	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Levites,	1
for	1
Uriel,	1
Asaiah,	1
and	1
Joel,	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
Eliel,	1
and	1
Amminadab,	1
15:12	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
Levites:	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
both	1
ye	1
and	1
your	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
15:13	1
For	1
because	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
made	1
a	1
breach	1
upon	1
us,	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
sought	1
him	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
due	1
order.	1
	1
15:14	1
So	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
sanctified	1
themselves	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
with	1
the	1
staves	1
thereon,	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
David	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
appoint	1
their	1
brethren	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
singers	1
with	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
psalteries	1
and	1
harps	1
and	1
cymbals,	1
sounding,	1
by	1
lifting	1
up	1
the	1
voice	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
15:17	1
So	1
the	1
Levites	1
appointed	1
Heman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joel;	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Asaph	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari	1
their	1
brethren,	1
Ethan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kushaiah;	1
15:18	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
their	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
degree,	1
Zechariah,	1
Ben,	1
and	1
Jaaziel,	1
and	1
Shemiramoth,	1
and	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Unni,	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
and	1
Maaseiah,	1
and	1
Mattithiah,	1
and	1
Elipheleh,	1
and	1
Mikneiah,	1
and	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
Jeiel,	1
the	1
porters.	1
	1
15:19	1
So	1
the	1
singers,	1
Heman,	1
Asaph,	1
and	1
Ethan,	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
sound	1
with	1
cymbals	1
of	1
brass;	1
15:20	1
And	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Aziel,	1
and	1
Shemiramoth,	1
and	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Unni,	1
and	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
Maaseiah,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
with	1
psalteries	1
on	1
Alamoth;	1
15:21	1
And	1
Mattithiah,	1
and	1
Elipheleh,	1
and	1
Mikneiah,	1
and	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
Jeiel,	1
and	1
Azaziah,	1
with	1
harps	1
on	1
the	1
Sheminith	1
to	1
excel.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
Chenaniah,	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
was	1
for	1
song:	1
he	1
instructed	1
about	1
the	1
song,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
skilful.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
Berechiah	1
and	1
Elkanah	1
were	1
doorkeepers	1
for	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
Shebaniah,	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
Nethaneel,	1
and	1
Amasai,	1
and	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
and	1
Eliezer,	1
the	1
priests,	1
did	1
blow	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
Obededom	1
and	1
Jehiah	1
were	1
doorkeepers	1
for	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
15:25	1
So	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
went	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Obededom	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
God	1
helped	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
they	1
offered	1
seven	1
bullocks	1
and	1
seven	1
rams.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
David	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
robe	1
of	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
bare	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
Chenaniah	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
with	1
the	1
singers:	1
David	1
also	1
had	1
upon	1
him	1
an	1
ephod	1
of	1
linen.	1
	1
15:28	1
Thus	1
all	1
Israel	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
and	1
with	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
with	1
cymbals,	1
making	1
a	1
noise	1
with	1
psalteries	1
and	1
harps.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
that	1
Michal,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Saul	1
looking	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
saw	1
king	1
David	1
dancing	1
and	1
playing:	1
and	1
she	1
despised	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
16:1	1
So	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
pitched	1
for	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
offered	1
burnt	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
he	1
blessed	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
he	1
dealt	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
Israel,	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
woman,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
a	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
flesh,	1
and	1
a	1
flagon	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
he	1
appointed	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
minister	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
record,	1
and	1
to	1
thank	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel:	1
16:5	1
Asaph	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
next	1
to	1
him	1
Zechariah,	1
Jeiel,	1
and	1
Shemiramoth,	1
and	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Mattithiah,	1
and	1
Eliab,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
and	1
Obededom:	1
and	1
Jeiel	1
with	1
psalteries	1
and	1
with	1
harps;	1
but	1
Asaph	1
made	1
a	1
sound	1
with	1
cymbals;	1
16:6	1
Benaiah	1
also	1
and	1
Jahaziel	1
the	1
priests	1
with	1
trumpets	1
continually	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:7	1
Then	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
David	1
delivered	1
first	1
this	1
psalm	1
to	1
thank	1
the	1
LORD	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Asaph	1
and	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:8	1
Give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
call	1
upon	1
his	1
name,	1
make	1
known	1
his	1
deeds	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
16:9	1
Sing	1
unto	1
him,	1
sing	1
psalms	1
unto	1
him,	1
talk	1
ye	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wondrous	1
works.	1
	1
16:10	1
Glory	1
ye	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
name:	1
let	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
them	1
rejoice	1
that	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:11	1
Seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
his	1
strength,	1
seek	1
his	1
face	1
continually.	1
	1
16:12	1
Remember	1
his	1
marvellous	1
works	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
his	1
wonders,	1
and	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
his	1
mouth;	1
16:13	1
O	1
ye	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
his	1
servant,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
his	1
chosen	1
ones.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
his	1
judgments	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:15	1
Be	1
ye	1
mindful	1
always	1
of	1
his	1
covenant;	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
generations;	1
16:16	1
Even	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
oath	1
unto	1
Isaac;	1
16:17	1
And	1
hath	1
confirmed	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
Jacob	1
for	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
for	1
an	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
16:18	1
Saying,	1
Unto	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
your	1
inheritance;	1
16:19	1
When	1
ye	1
were	1
but	1
few,	1
even	1
a	1
few,	1
and	1
strangers	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
from	1
nation	1
to	1
nation,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
kingdom	1
to	1
another	1
people;	1
16:21	1
He	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
wrong:	1
yea,	1
he	1
reproved	1
kings	1
for	1
their	1
sakes,	1
16:22	1
Saying,	1
Touch	1
not	1
mine	1
anointed,	1
and	1
do	1
my	1
prophets	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
16:23	1
Sing	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
shew	1
forth	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
his	1
salvation.	1
	1
16:24	1
Declare	1
his	1
glory	1
among	1
the	1
heathen;	1
his	1
marvellous	1
works	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
16:25	1
For	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
greatly	1
to	1
be	1
praised:	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
16:26	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
idols:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
16:27	1
Glory	1
and	1
honour	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
presence;	1
strength	1
and	1
gladness	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
16:28	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
glory	1
and	1
strength.	1
	1
16:29	1
Give	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
glory	1
due	1
unto	1
his	1
name:	1
bring	1
an	1
offering,	1
and	1
come	1
before	1
him:	1
worship	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
holiness.	1
	1
16:30	1
Fear	1
before	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
the	1
world	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
stable,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
moved.	1
	1
16:31	1
Let	1
the	1
heavens	1
be	1
glad,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
earth	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
let	1
men	1
say	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
The	1
LORD	1
reigneth.	1
	1
16:32	1
Let	1
the	1
sea	1
roar,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof:	1
let	1
the	1
fields	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein.	1
	1
16:33	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
sing	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:34	1
O	1
give	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
good;	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
say	1
ye,	1
Save	1
us,	1
O	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
salvation,	1
and	1
gather	1
us	1
together,	1
and	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
heathen,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
thy	1
holy	1
name,	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
thy	1
praise.	1
	1
16:36	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
said,	1
Amen,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
16:37	1
So	1
he	1
left	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Asaph	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
to	1
minister	1
before	1
the	1
ark	1
continually,	1
as	1
every	1
day's	1
work	1
required:	1
16:38	1
And	1
Obededom	1
with	1
their	1
brethren,	1
threescore	1
and	1
eight;	1
Obededom	1
also	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeduthun	1
and	1
Hosah	1
to	1
be	1
porters:	1
16:39	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
priests,	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Gibeon,	1
16:40	1
To	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
continually	1
morning	1
and	1
evening,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
commanded	1
Israel;	1
16:41	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
Heman	1
and	1
Jeduthun,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
that	1
were	1
chosen,	1
who	1
were	1
expressed	1
by	1
name,	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever;	1
16:42	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
Heman	1
and	1
Jeduthun	1
with	1
trumpets	1
and	1
cymbals	1
for	1
those	1
that	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
sound,	1
and	1
with	1
musical	1
instruments	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jeduthun	1
were	1
porters.	1
	1
16:43	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
departed	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house:	1
and	1
David	1
returned	1
to	1
bless	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
David	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
dwell	1
in	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedars,	1
but	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
remaineth	1
under	1
curtains.	1
	1
17:2	1
Then	1
Nathan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Do	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
heart;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
to	1
Nathan,	1
saying,	1
17:4	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
David	1
my	1
servant,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
to	1
dwell	1
in:	1
17:5	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
dwelt	1
in	1
an	1
house	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
unto	1
this	1
day;	1
but	1
have	1
gone	1
from	1
tent	1
to	1
tent,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
tabernacle	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
17:6	1
Wheresoever	1
I	1
have	1
walked	1
with	1
all	1
Israel,	1
spake	1
I	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
I	1
commanded	1
to	1
feed	1
my	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
built	1
me	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
cedars?	1
	1
17:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
my	1
servant	1
David,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
took	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
sheepcote,	1
even	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
sheep,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
ruler	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
17:8	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
walked,	1
and	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
from	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
name	1
like	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
17:9	1
Also	1
I	1
will	1
ordain	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
will	1
plant	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
no	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wickedness	1
waste	1
them	1
any	1
more,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
17:10	1
And	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
commanded	1
judges	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
subdue	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
Furthermore	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
build	1
thee	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
thy	1
days	1
be	1
expired	1
that	1
thou	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
thy	1
seed	1
after	1
thee,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
of	1
thy	1
sons;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
17:12	1
He	1
shall	1
build	1
me	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
stablish	1
his	1
throne	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
17:13	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
my	1
mercy	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
thee:	1
17:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
settle	1
him	1
in	1
mine	1
house	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
his	1
throne	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
17:15	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
vision,	1
so	1
did	1
Nathan	1
speak	1
unto	1
David.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
and	1
sat	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
am	1
I,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
mine	1
house,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
me	1
hitherto?	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
yet	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
thing	1
in	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
O	1
God;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
spoken	1
of	1
thy	1
servant's	1
house	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
hast	1
regarded	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
degree,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
17:18	1
What	1
can	1
David	1
speak	1
more	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
thy	1
servant?	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
17:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
for	1
thy	1
servant's	1
sake,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
heart,	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
greatness,	1
in	1
making	1
known	1
all	1
these	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
17:20	1
O	1
LORD,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
like	1
thee,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
God	1
beside	1
thee,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
with	1
our	1
ears.	1
	1
17:21	1
And	1
what	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
like	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
God	1
went	1
to	1
redeem	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
people,	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
name	1
of	1
greatness	1
and	1
terribleness,	1
by	1
driving	1
out	1
nations	1
from	1
before	1
thy	1
people	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
	1
17:22	1
For	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
didst	1
thou	1
make	1
thine	1
own	1
people	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
thou,	1
LORD,	1
becamest	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
17:23	1
Therefore	1
now,	1
LORD,	1
let	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
concerning	1
thy	1
servant	1
and	1
concerning	1
his	1
house	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
17:24	1
Let	1
it	1
even	1
be	1
established,	1
that	1
thy	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
magnified	1
for	1
ever,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
a	1
God	1
to	1
Israel:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
servant	1
be	1
established	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
17:25	1
For	1
thou,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
hast	1
told	1
thy	1
servant	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house:	1
therefore	1
thy	1
servant	1
hath	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
now,	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
God,	1
and	1
hast	1
promised	1
this	1
goodness	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant:	1
17:27	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
it	1
please	1
thee	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
before	1
thee	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
thou	1
blessest,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
18:1	1
Now	1
after	1
this	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
David	1
smote	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
subdued	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
Gath	1
and	1
her	1
towns	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
smote	1
Moab;	1
and	1
the	1
Moabites	1
became	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
David	1
smote	1
Hadarezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah	1
unto	1
Hamath,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
stablish	1
his	1
dominion	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
from	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
footmen:	1
David	1
also	1
houghed	1
all	1
the	1
chariot	1
horses,	1
but	1
reserved	1
of	1
them	1
an	1
hundred	1
chariots.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
of	1
Damascus	1
came	1
to	1
help	1
Hadarezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah,	1
David	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
18:6	1
Then	1
David	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Syriadamascus;	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
became	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
brought	1
gifts.	1
Thus	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Hadarezer,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
18:8	1
Likewise	1
from	1
Tibhath,	1
and	1
from	1
Chun,	1
cities	1
of	1
Hadarezer,	1
brought	1
David	1
very	1
much	1
brass,	1
wherewith	1
Solomon	1
made	1
the	1
brasen	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
pillars,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
18:9	1
Now	1
when	1
Tou	1
king	1
of	1
Hamath	1
heard	1
how	1
David	1
had	1
smitten	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadarezer	1
king	1
of	1
Zobah;	1
18:10	1
He	1
sent	1
Hadoram	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
king	1
David,	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
his	1
welfare,	1
and	1
to	1
congratulate	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
fought	1
against	1
Hadarezer,	1
and	1
smitten	1
him;	1
(for	1
Hadarezer	1
had	1
war	1
with	1
Tou;)	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
brass.	1
	1
18:11	1
Them	1
also	1
king	1
David	1
dedicated	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
from	1
all	1
these	1
nations;	1
from	1
Edom,	1
and	1
from	1
Moab,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
from	1
Amalek.	1
	1
18:12	1
Moreover	1
Abishai	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
salt	1
eighteen	1
thousand.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
garrisons	1
in	1
Edom;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Edomites	1
became	1
David's	1
servants.	1
Thus	1
the	1
LORD	1
preserved	1
David	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
18:14	1
So	1
David	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
executed	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice	1
among	1
all	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Joab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zeruiah	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
host;	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahilud,	1
recorder.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
Zadok	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
and	1
Abimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar,	1
were	1
the	1
priests;	1
and	1
Shavsha	1
was	1
scribe;	1
18:17	1
And	1
Benaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
Cherethites	1
and	1
the	1
Pelethites;	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
David	1
were	1
chief	1
about	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
19:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Nahash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
died,	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
kindness	1
unto	1
Hanun	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nahash,	1
because	1
his	1
father	1
shewed	1
kindness	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
David	1
sent	1
messengers	1
to	1
comfort	1
him	1
concerning	1
his	1
father.	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
David	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
to	1
Hanun,	1
to	1
comfort	1
him.	1
	1
19:3	1
But	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
said	1
to	1
Hanun,	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
David	1
doth	1
honour	1
thy	1
father,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
comforters	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
servants	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
to	1
search,	1
and	1
to	1
overthrow,	1
and	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
the	1
land?	1
	1
19:4	1
Wherefore	1
Hanun	1
took	1
David's	1
servants,	1
and	1
shaved	1
them,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
hard	1
by	1
their	1
buttocks,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
19:5	1
Then	1
there	1
went	1
certain,	1
and	1
told	1
David	1
how	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
served.	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
greatly	1
ashamed.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said,	1
Tarry	1
at	1
Jericho	1
until	1
your	1
beards	1
be	1
grown,	1
and	1
then	1
return.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
themselves	1
odious	1
to	1
David,	1
Hanun	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
sent	1
a	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
hire	1
them	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen	1
out	1
of	1
Mesopotamia,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Syriamaachah,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Zobah.	1
	1
19:7	1
So	1
they	1
hired	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
chariots,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Maachah	1
and	1
his	1
people;	1
who	1
came	1
and	1
pitched	1
before	1
Medeba.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
from	1
their	1
cities,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
when	1
David	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
sent	1
Joab,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
before	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
were	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
19:10	1
Now	1
when	1
Joab	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
set	1
against	1
him	1
before	1
and	1
behind,	1
he	1
chose	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
themselves	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
the	1
Syrians	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
me,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
help	1
me:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
thee,	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee.	1
	1
19:13	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
behave	1
ourselves	1
valiantly	1
for	1
our	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
our	1
God:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
LORD	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
19:14	1
So	1
Joab	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
drew	1
nigh	1
before	1
the	1
Syrians	1
unto	1
the	1
battle;	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
Syrians	1
were	1
fled,	1
they	1
likewise	1
fled	1
before	1
Abishai	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
Then	1
Joab	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Syrians	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
worse	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
sent	1
messengers,	1
and	1
drew	1
forth	1
the	1
Syrians	1
that	1
were	1
beyond	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
Shophach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Hadarezer	1
went	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
David;	1
and	1
he	1
gathered	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
passed	1
over	1
Jordan,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
them.	1
So	1
when	1
David	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians,	1
they	1
fought	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:18	1
But	1
the	1
Syrians	1
fled	1
before	1
Israel;	1
and	1
David	1
slew	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
seven	1
thousand	1
men	1
which	1
fought	1
in	1
chariots,	1
and	1
forty	1
thousand	1
footmen,	1
and	1
killed	1
Shophach	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
host.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Hadarezer	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
worse	1
before	1
Israel,	1
they	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
became	1
his	1
servants:	1
neither	1
would	1
the	1
Syrians	1
help	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
year	1
was	1
expired,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
kings	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
battle,	1
Joab	1
led	1
forth	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
wasted	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
besieged	1
Rabbah.	1
But	1
David	1
tarried	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
Joab	1
smote	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
it.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
David	1
took	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
their	1
king	1
from	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
to	1
weigh	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
precious	1
stones	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
set	1
upon	1
David's	1
head:	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
also	1
exceeding	1
much	1
spoil	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
with	1
saws,	1
and	1
with	1
harrows	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
with	1
axes.	1
Even	1
so	1
dealt	1
David	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
And	1
David	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
there	1
arose	1
war	1
at	1
Gezer	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
at	1
which	1
time	1
Sibbechai	1
the	1
Hushathite	1
slew	1
Sippai,	1
that	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
giant:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
subdued.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
Philistines;	1
and	1
Elhanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jair	1
slew	1
Lahmi	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Goliath	1
the	1
Gittite,	1
whose	1
spear	1
staff	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
weaver's	1
beam.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
yet	1
again	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
at	1
Gath,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
stature,	1
whose	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
twenty,	1
six	1
on	1
each	1
hand,	1
and	1
six	1
on	1
each	1
foot	1
and	1
he	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
giant.	1
	1
20:7	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
defied	1
Israel,	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimea	1
David's	1
brother	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
20:8	1
These	1
were	1
born	1
unto	1
the	1
giant	1
in	1
Gath;	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
Satan	1
stood	1
up	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
provoked	1
David	1
to	1
number	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Joab	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
Go,	1
number	1
Israel	1
from	1
Beersheba	1
even	1
to	1
Dan;	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
Joab	1
answered,	1
The	1
LORD	1
make	1
his	1
people	1
an	1
hundred	1
times	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
as	1
they	1
be:	1
but,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
my	1
lord's	1
servants?	1
	1
why	1
then	1
doth	1
my	1
lord	1
require	1
this	1
thing?	1
why	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
trespass	1
to	1
Israel?	1
	1
21:4	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
king's	1
word	1
prevailed	1
against	1
Joab.	1
Wherefore	1
Joab	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
Joab	1
gave	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
David.	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
a	1
thousand	1
thousand	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword:	1
and	1
Judah	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
drew	1
sword.	1
	1
21:6	1
But	1
Levi	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
counted	1
he	1
not	1
among	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
word	1
was	1
abominable	1
to	1
Joab.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
God	1
was	1
displeased	1
with	1
this	1
thing;	1
therefore	1
he	1
smote	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
greatly,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
this	1
thing:	1
but	1
now,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
do	1
away	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
thy	1
servant;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
foolishly.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
Gad,	1
David's	1
seer,	1
saying,	1
21:10	1
Go	1
and	1
tell	1
David,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
offer	1
thee	1
three	1
things:	1
choose	1
thee	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
21:11	1
So	1
Gad	1
came	1
to	1
David,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Choose	1
thee	1
21:12	1
Either	1
three	1
years'	1
famine;	1
or	1
three	1
months	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
before	1
thy	1
foes,	1
while	1
that	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies	1
overtaketh	1
thee;	1
or	1
else	1
three	1
days	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
destroying	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Israel.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
advise	1
thyself	1
what	1
word	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
Gad,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
strait:	1
let	1
me	1
fall	1
now	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
very	1
great	1
are	1
his	1
mercies:	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
21:14	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
pestilence	1
upon	1
Israel:	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
of	1
Israel	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
God	1
sent	1
an	1
angel	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
destroy	1
it:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
destroying,	1
the	1
LORD	1
beheld,	1
and	1
he	1
repented	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
destroyed,	1
It	1
is	1
enough,	1
stay	1
now	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Ornan	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
David	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stand	1
between	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven,	1
having	1
a	1
drawn	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
stretched	1
out	1
over	1
Jerusalem.	1
Then	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
were	1
clothed	1
in	1
sackcloth,	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
I	1
that	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
numbered?	1
even	1
I	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
have	1
sinned	1
and	1
done	1
evil	1
indeed;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
these	1
sheep,	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
done?	1
let	1
thine	1
hand,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
be	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
father's	1
house;	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
thy	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
plagued.	1
	1
21:18	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
Gad	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
David,	1
that	1
David	1
should	1
go	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Ornan	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
David	1
went	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Gad,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
Ornan	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
angel;	1
and	1
his	1
four	1
sons	1
with	1
him	1
hid	1
themselves.	1
Now	1
Ornan	1
was	1
threshing	1
wheat.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
as	1
David	1
came	1
to	1
Ornan,	1
Ornan	1
looked	1
and	1
saw	1
David,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
threshingfloor,	1
and	1
bowed	1
himself	1
to	1
David	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
21:22	1
Then	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Ornan,	1
Grant	1
me	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
this	1
threshingfloor,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
build	1
an	1
altar	1
therein	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
grant	1
it	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
full	1
price:	1
that	1
the	1
plague	1
may	1
be	1
stayed	1
from	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
Ornan	1
said	1
unto	1
David,	1
Take	1
it	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
eyes:	1
lo,	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
oxen	1
also	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
threshing	1
instruments	1
for	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
wheat	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
offering;	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
all.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
king	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Ornan,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
verily	1
buy	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
full	1
price:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
thine	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
without	1
cost.	1
	1
21:25	1
So	1
David	1
gave	1
to	1
Ornan	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold	1
by	1
weight.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
David	1
built	1
there	1
an	1
altar	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
fire	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded	1
the	1
angel;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
sheath	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:28	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
when	1
David	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
answered	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Ornan	1
the	1
Jebusite,	1
then	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
there.	1
	1
21:29	1
For	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
Moses	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
at	1
Gibeon.	1
	1
21:30	1
But	1
David	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
before	1
it	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
22:1	1
Then	1
David	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
for	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
David	1
commanded	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
masons	1
to	1
hew	1
wrought	1
stones	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
David	1
prepared	1
iron	1
in	1
abundance	1
for	1
the	1
nails	1
for	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
joinings;	1
and	1
brass	1
in	1
abundance	1
without	1
weight;	1
22:4	1
Also	1
cedar	1
trees	1
in	1
abundance:	1
for	1
the	1
Zidonians	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
Tyre	1
brought	1
much	1
cedar	1
wood	1
to	1
David.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
David	1
said,	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
tender,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
builded	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
must	1
be	1
exceeding	1
magnifical,	1
of	1
fame	1
and	1
of	1
glory	1
throughout	1
all	1
countries:	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
now	1
make	1
preparation	1
for	1
it.	1
So	1
David	1
prepared	1
abundantly	1
before	1
his	1
death.	1
	1
22:6	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
My	1
son,	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God:	1
22:8	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shed	1
blood	1
abundantly,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
great	1
wars:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
shed	1
much	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
22:9	1
Behold,	1
a	1
son	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
to	1
thee,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
rest;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
rest	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
enemies	1
round	1
about:	1
for	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
peace	1
and	1
quietness	1
unto	1
Israel	1
in	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
22:10	1
He	1
shall	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
father;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
over	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
22:11	1
Now,	1
my	1
son,	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
and	1
prosper	1
thou,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
said	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
22:12	1
Only	1
the	1
LORD	1
give	1
thee	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
charge	1
concerning	1
Israel,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
22:13	1
Then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
prosper,	1
if	1
thou	1
takest	1
heed	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
charged	1
Moses	1
with	1
concerning	1
Israel:	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
courage;	1
dread	1
not,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed.	1
	1
22:14	1
Now,	1
behold,	1
in	1
my	1
trouble	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
silver;	1
and	1
of	1
brass	1
and	1
iron	1
without	1
weight;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
abundance:	1
timber	1
also	1
and	1
stone	1
have	1
I	1
prepared;	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
add	1
thereto.	1
	1
22:15	1
Moreover	1
there	1
are	1
workmen	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
abundance,	1
hewers	1
and	1
workers	1
of	1
stone	1
and	1
timber,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
cunning	1
men	1
for	1
every	1
manner	1
of	1
work.	1
	1
22:16	1
Of	1
the	1
gold,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
brass,	1
and	1
the	1
iron,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
number.	1
Arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
doing,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
22:17	1
David	1
also	1
commanded	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
help	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
saying,	1
22:18	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
with	1
you?	1
and	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
given	1
you	1
rest	1
on	1
every	1
side?	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
mine	1
hand;	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
subdued	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
22:19	1
Now	1
set	1
your	1
heart	1
and	1
your	1
soul	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
build	1
ye	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
vessels	1
of	1
God,	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
built	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:1	1
So	1
when	1
David	1
was	1
old	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
days,	1
he	1
made	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son	1
king	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
with	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
23:3	1
Now	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
numbered	1
from	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
thirty	1
years	1
and	1
upward:	1
and	1
their	1
number	1
by	1
their	1
polls,	1
man	1
by	1
man,	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
thousand.	1
	1
23:4	1
Of	1
which,	1
twenty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
were	1
to	1
set	1
forward	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
six	1
thousand	1
were	1
officers	1
and	1
judges:	1
23:5	1
Moreover	1
four	1
thousand	1
were	1
porters;	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
the	1
instruments	1
which	1
I	1
made,	1
said	1
David,	1
to	1
praise	1
therewith.	1
	1
23:6	1
And	1
David	1
divided	1
them	1
into	1
courses	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
namely,	1
Gershon,	1
Kohath,	1
and	1
Merari.	1
	1
23:7	1
Of	1
the	1
Gershonites	1
were,	1
Laadan,	1
and	1
Shimei.	1
	1
23:8	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Laadan;	1
the	1
chief	1
was	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Zetham,	1
and	1
Joel,	1
three.	1
	1
23:9	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Shimei;	1
Shelomith,	1
and	1
Haziel,	1
and	1
Haran,	1
three.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Laadan.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shimei	1
were,	1
Jahath,	1
Zina,	1
and	1
Jeush,	1
and	1
Beriah.	1
	1
These	1
four	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Shimei.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
Jahath	1
was	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
Zizah	1
the	1
second:	1
but	1
Jeush	1
and	1
Beriah	1
had	1
not	1
many	1
sons;	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
reckoning,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
father's	1
house.	1
	1
23:12	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Kohath;	1
Amram,	1
Izhar,	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
Uzziel,	1
four.	1
	1
23:13	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Amram;	1
Aaron	1
and	1
Moses:	1
and	1
Aaron	1
was	1
separated,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
sanctify	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
for	1
ever,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
bless	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
23:14	1
Now	1
concerning	1
Moses	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
his	1
sons	1
were	1
named	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
23:15	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Moses	1
were,	1
Gershom,	1
and	1
Eliezer.	1
	1
23:16	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Gershom,	1
Shebuel	1
was	1
the	1
chief.	1
	1
23:17	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eliezer	1
were,	1
Rehabiah	1
the	1
chief.	1
And	1
Eliezer	1
had	1
none	1
other	1
sons;	1
but	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Rehabiah	1
were	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
23:18	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Izhar;	1
Shelomith	1
the	1
chief.	1
	1
23:19	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Hebron;	1
Jeriah	1
the	1
first,	1
Amariah	1
the	1
second,	1
Jahaziel	1
the	1
third,	1
and	1
Jekameam	1
the	1
fourth.	1
	1
23:20	1
Of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Uzziel;	1
Micah	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
Jesiah	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
23:21	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari;	1
Mahli,	1
and	1
Mushi.	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Mahli;	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
Kish.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
Eleazar	1
died,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
sons,	1
but	1
daughters:	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Kish	1
took	1
them.	1
	1
23:23	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Mushi;	1
Mahli,	1
and	1
Eder,	1
and	1
Jeremoth,	1
three.	1
	1
23:24	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi	1
after	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers;	1
even	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
by	1
number	1
of	1
names	1
by	1
their	1
polls,	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty	1
years	1
and	1
upward.	1
	1
23:25	1
For	1
David	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
hath	1
given	1
rest	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
ever:	1
23:26	1
And	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites;	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
carry	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
nor	1
any	1
vessels	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
thereof.	1
	1
23:27	1
For	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
David	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
numbered	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above:	1
23:28	1
Because	1
their	1
office	1
was	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
courts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
chambers,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
all	1
holy	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
23:29	1
Both	1
for	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
flour	1
for	1
meat	1
offering,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
unleavened	1
cakes,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
baked	1
in	1
the	1
pan,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
fried,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
measure	1
and	1
size;	1
23:30	1
And	1
to	1
stand	1
every	1
morning	1
to	1
thank	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
likewise	1
at	1
even:	1
23:31	1
And	1
to	1
offer	1
all	1
burnt	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
sabbaths,	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
set	1
feasts,	1
by	1
number,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
commanded	1
unto	1
them,	1
continually	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
23:32	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
their	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:1	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron.	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron;	1
Nadab,	1
and	1
Abihu,	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
Ithamar.	1
	1
24:2	1
But	1
Nadab	1
and	1
Abihu	1
died	1
before	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
children:	1
therefore	1
Eleazar	1
and	1
Ithamar	1
executed	1
the	1
priest's	1
office.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
David	1
distributed	1
them,	1
both	1
Zadok	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ithamar,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
offices	1
in	1
their	1
service.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
chief	1
men	1
found	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ithamar,	1
and	1
thus	1
were	1
they	1
divided.	1
Among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eleazar	1
there	1
were	1
sixteen	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
eight	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ithamar	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
24:5	1
Thus	1
were	1
they	1
divided	1
by	1
lot,	1
one	1
sort	1
with	1
another;	1
for	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Ithamar.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nethaneel	1
the	1
scribe,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
wrote	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
Zadok	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Ahimelech	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abiathar,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites:	1
one	1
principal	1
household	1
being	1
taken	1
for	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
one	1
taken	1
for	1
Ithamar.	1

in	1
their	1
service	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1

under	1

as	1
the	1

God	1
of	1

commanded	1
him.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1

28:2	1
Then	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
up	1
upon	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hear	1
me,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
my	1
people:	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
footstool	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
had	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
building:	1
28:3	1
But	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
hast	1
shed	1
blood.	1
	1
28:4	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
chose	1
me	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
Israel	1
for	1
ever:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Judah	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ruler;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
father;	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
he	1
liked	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel:	1
28:5	1
And	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
sons,	1
(for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
many	1
sons,)	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
28:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Solomon	1
thy	1
son,	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
my	1
courts:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
28:7	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
establish	1
his	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
constant	1
to	1
do	1
my	1
commandments	1
and	1
my	1
judgments,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:8	1
Now	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
keep	1
and	1
seek	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
possess	1
this	1
good	1
land,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
for	1
your	1
children	1
after	1
you	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
thou,	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son,	1
know	1
thou	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
willing	1
mind:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
searcheth	1
all	1
hearts,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
all	1
the	1
imaginations	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts:	1
if	1
thou	1
seek	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
thee;	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
forsake	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
cast	1
thee	1
off	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
28:10	1
Take	1
heed	1
now;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
sanctuary:	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
28:11	1
Then	1
David	1
gave	1
to	1

28:16	1
And	1
by	1
weight	1
he	1
gave	1
gold	1
for	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
shewbread,	1
for	1
every	1
table;	1
and	1
likewise	1
silver	1
for	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
silver:	1
28:17	1
Also	1
pure	1
gold	1
for	1
the	1
fleshhooks,	1
and	1
the	1
bowls,	1
and	1
the	1
cups:	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
golden	1
basons	1
he	1
gave	1
gold	1
by	1
weight	1
for	1
every	1
bason;	1
and	1
likewise	1
silver	1
by	1
weight	1
for	1
every	1
bason	1
of	1
silver:	1
28:18	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense	1
refined	1
gold	1
by	1
weight;	1
and	1
gold	1
for	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
chariot	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims,	1
that	1
spread	1
out	1
their	1
wings,	1
and	1
covered	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:19	1
All	1
this,	1
said	1
David,	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
me	1
understand	1
in	1
writing	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
me,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
this	1
pattern.	1
	1
28:20	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
do	1
it:	1
fear	1
not,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
even	1
my	1
God,	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
hast	1
finished	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:21	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
courses	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
workmanship	1
every	1
willing	1
skilful	1
man,	1
for	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
service:	1
also	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
wholly	1
at	1
thy	1
commandment.	1
	1
29:1	1
Furthermore	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son,	1
whom	1
alone	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
is	1
yet	1
young	1
and	1
tender,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
is	1
great:	1
for	1
the	1
palace	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
29:2	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
might	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
the	1
gold	1
for	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
brass	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
brass,	1
the	1
iron	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
wood	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
wood;	1
onyx	1
stones,	1
and	1
stones	1
to	1
be	1
set,	1
glistering	1
stones,	1
and	1
of	1
divers	1
colours,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
marble	1
stones	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
29:3	1
Moreover,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
my	1
affection	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
proper	1
good,	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
house.	1
	1
29:4	1
Even	1
three	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
Ophir,	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
refined	1
silver,	1
to	1
overlay	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
withal:	1
29:5	1
The	1
gold	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
artificers.	1
And	1
who	1
then	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
consecrate	1
his	1
service	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
29:6	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
with	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
work,	1
offered	1
willingly,	1
29:7	1
And	1
gave	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
gold	1
five	1
thousand	1
talents	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
drams,	1
and	1
of	1
silver	1
ten	1
thousand	1
talents,	1
and	1
of	1
brass	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
talents,	1
and	1
one	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
iron.	1
	1
29:8	1
And	1
they	1
with	1
whom	1
precious	1
stones	1
were	1
found	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jehiel	1
the	1
Gershonite.	1
	1
29:9	1
Then	1
the	1
people	1
rejoiced,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
offered	1
willingly,	1
because	1
with	1
perfect	1
heart	1
they	1
offered	1
willingly	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
also	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
great	1
joy.	1
	1
29:10	1
Wherefore	1
David	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
congregation:	1
and	1
David	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
thou,	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
our	1
father,	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
29:11	1
Thine,	1
O	1
LORD	1
is	1
the	1
greatness,	1
and	1
the	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
victory,	1
and	1
the	1
majesty:	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
thine;	1
thine	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
exalted	1
as	1
head	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
29:12	1
Both	1
riches	1
and	1
honour	1
come	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
reignest	1
over	1
all;	1
and	1
in	1
thine	1
hand	1
is	1
power	1
and	1
might;	1
and	1
in	1
thine	1
hand	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
great,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
strength	1
unto	1
all.	1
	1
29:13	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
our	1
God,	1
we	1
thank	1
thee,	1
and	1
praise	1
thy	1
glorious	1
name.	1
	1
29:14	1
But	1
who	1
am	1
I,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
offer	1
so	1
willingly	1
after	1
this	1
sort?	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
come	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
have	1
we	1
given	1
thee.	1
	1
29:15	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
strangers	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
sojourners,	1
as	1
were	1
all	1
our	1
fathers:	1
our	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
as	1
a	1
shadow,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
abiding.	1
	1
29:16	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
all	1
this	1
store	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
prepared	1
to	1
build	1
thee	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
thine	1
holy	1
name	1
cometh	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
is	1
all	1
thine	1
own.	1
	1
29:17	1
I	1
know	1
also,	1
my	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
triest	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
hast	1
pleasure	1
in	1
uprightness.	1
As	1
for	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
uprightness	1
of	1
mine	1
heart	1
I	1
have	1
willingly	1
offered	1
all	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
with	1
joy	1
thy	1
people,	1
which	1
are	1
present	1
here,	1
to	1
offer	1
willingly	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
29:18	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Israel,	1
our	1
fathers,	1
keep	1
this	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
prepare	1
their	1
heart	1
unto	1
thee:	1
29:19	1
And	1
give	1
unto	1
Solomon	1
my	1
son	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart,	1
to	1
keep	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
thy	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
thy	1
statutes,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
palace,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
provision.	1
	1
29:20	1
And	1
David	1
said	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
congregation,	1
Now	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
sacrifices	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
that	1
day,	1
even	1
a	1
thousand	1
bullocks,	1
a	1
thousand	1
rams,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
lambs,	1
with	1
their	1
drink	1
offerings,	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
in	1
abundance	1
for	1
all	1
Israel:	1
29:22	1
And	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
great	1
gladness.	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
anointed	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
governor,	1
and	1
Zadok	1
to	1
be	1
priest.	1
	1
29:23	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
as	1
king	1
instead	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
prospered;	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
obeyed	1
him.	1
	1
29:24	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
sons	1
likewise	1
of	1
king	1
David,	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
Solomon	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
29:25	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
magnified	1
Solomon	1
exceedingly	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
Israel,	1
and	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him	1
such	1
royal	1
majesty	1
as	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
on	1
any	1
king	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:26	1
Thus	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:27	1
And	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel	1
was	1
forty	1
years;	1
seven	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Hebron,	1
and	1
thirty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
reigned	1
he	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
29:28	1
And	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
old	1
age,	1
full	1
of	1
days,	1
riches,	1
and	1
honour:	1
and	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
29:29	1
Now	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
David	1
the	1
king,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Samuel	1
the	1
seer,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Gad	1
the	1
seer,	1
29:30	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
reign	1
and	1
his	1
might,	1
and	1
the	1
times	1
that	1
went	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
over	1
Israel,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Second	1
Book	1
of	1
the	1
Chronicles	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
And	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
was	1
strengthened	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
magnified	1
him	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
1:2	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
spake	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
to	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands	1
and	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
judges,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
governor	1
in	1
all	1
Israel,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:3	1
So	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
with	1
him,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Gibeon;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
God	1
had	1
David	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
Kirjathjearim	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
which	1
David	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
it:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
pitched	1
a	1
tent	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:5	1
Moreover	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar,	1
that	1
Bezaleel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uri,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hur,	1
had	1
made,	1
he	1
put	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
Solomon	1
and	1
the	1
congregation	1
sought	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
Solomon	1
went	1
up	1
thither	1
to	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
thousand	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
1:7	1
In	1
that	1
night	1
did	1
God	1
appear	1
unto	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ask	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
Solomon	1
said	1
unto	1
God,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
great	1
mercy	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
to	1
reign	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
1:9	1
Now,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
let	1
thy	1
promise	1
unto	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
be	1
established:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
me	1
king	1
over	1
a	1
people	1
like	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
multitude.	1
	1
1:10	1
Give	1
me	1
now	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
come	1
in	1
before	1
this	1
people:	1
for	1
who	1
can	1
judge	1
this	1
thy	1
people,	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
great?	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
Because	1
this	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
asked	1
riches,	1
wealth,	1
or	1
honour,	1
nor	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies,	1
neither	1
yet	1
hast	1
asked	1
long	1
life;	1
but	1
hast	1
asked	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
for	1
thyself,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
judge	1
my	1
people,	1
over	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
king:	1
1:12	1
Wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
is	1
granted	1
unto	1
thee;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
riches,	1
and	1
wealth,	1
and	1
honour,	1
such	1
as	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
have	1
had	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
before	1
thee,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
any	1
after	1
thee	1
have	1
the	1
like.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
journey	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
place	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Gibeon	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
reigned	1
over	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Solomon	1
gathered	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen:	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
four	1
hundred	1
chariots,	1
and	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
horsemen,	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
chariot	1
cities,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
as	1
plenteous	1
as	1
stones,	1
and	1
cedar	1
trees	1
made	1
he	1
as	1
the	1
sycomore	1
trees	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
vale	1
for	1
abundance.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
horses	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
linen	1
yarn:	1
the	1
king's	1
merchants	1
received	1
the	1
linen	1
yarn	1
at	1
a	1
price.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
they	1
fetched	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
a	1
chariot	1
for	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
an	1
horse	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty:	1
and	1
so	1
brought	1
they	1
out	1
horses	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Syria,	1
by	1
their	1
means.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
Solomon	1
determined	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
Solomon	1
told	1
out	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
men	1
to	1
bear	1
burdens,	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
to	1
hew	1
in	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
to	1
oversee	1
them.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
Solomon	1
sent	1
to	1
Huram	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre,	1
saying,	1
As	1
thou	1
didst	1
deal	1
with	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
didst	1
send	1
him	1
cedars	1
to	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house	1
to	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
even	1
so	1
deal	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:4	1
Behold,	1
I	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
dedicate	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
burn	1
before	1
him	1
sweet	1
incense,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
continual	1
shewbread,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
morning	1
and	1
evening,	1
on	1
the	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
solemn	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
ordinance	1
for	1
ever	1
to	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
build	1
is	1
great:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
our	1
God	1
above	1
all	1
gods.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house,	1
seeing	1
the	1
heaven	1
and	1
heaven	1
of	1
heavens	1
cannot	1
contain	1
him?	1
who	1
am	1
I	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house,	1
save	1
only	1
to	1
burn	1
sacrifice	1
before	1
him?	1
	1
2:7	1
Send	1
me	1
now	1
therefore	1
a	1
man	1
cunning	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
and	1
in	1
brass,	1
and	1
in	1
iron,	1
and	1
in	1
purple,	1
and	1
crimson,	1
and	1
blue,	1
and	1
that	1
can	1
skill	1
to	1
grave	1
with	1
the	1
cunning	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
whom	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
did	1
provide.	1
	1
2:8	1
Send	1
me	1
also	1
cedar	1
trees,	1
fir	1
trees,	1
and	1
algum	1
trees,	1
out	1
of	1
Lebanon:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thy	1
servants	1
can	1
skill	1
to	1
cut	1
timber	1
in	1
Lebanon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
my	1
servants	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
servants,	1
2:9	1
Even	1
to	1
prepare	1
me	1
timber	1
in	1
abundance:	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
build	1
shall	1
be	1
wonderful	1
great.	1
	1
2:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
to	1
thy	1
servants,	1
the	1
hewers	1
that	1
cut	1
timber,	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
measures	1
of	1
beaten	1
wheat,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
measures	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
baths	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
baths	1
of	1
oil.	1
	1
2:11	1
Then	1
Huram	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Tyre	1
answered	1
in	1
writing,	1
which	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
loved	1
his	1
people,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
2:12	1
Huram	1
said	1
moreover,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
made	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
who	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
a	1
wise	1
son,	1
endued	1
with	1
prudence	1
and	1
understanding,	1
that	1
might	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
a	1
cunning	1
man,	1
endued	1
with	1
understanding,	1
of	1
Huram	1
my	1
father's,	1
2:14	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Dan,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Tyre,	1
skilful	1
to	1
work	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
in	1
silver,	1
in	1
brass,	1
in	1
iron,	1
in	1
stone,	1
and	1
in	1
timber,	1
in	1
purple,	1
in	1
blue,	1
and	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
in	1
crimson;	1
also	1
to	1
grave	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
graving,	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
every	1
device	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
thy	1
cunning	1
men,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
cunning	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
David	1
thy	1
father.	1
	1
2:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
the	1
wheat,	1
and	1
the	1
barley,	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
which	1
my	1
lord	1
hath	1
spoken	1
of,	1
let	1
him	1
send	1
unto	1
his	1
servants:	1
2:16	1
And	1
we	1
will	1
cut	1
wood	1
out	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
need:	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
floats	1
by	1
sea	1
to	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
carry	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
Solomon	1
numbered	1
all	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
after	1
the	1
numbering	1
wherewith	1
David	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
numbered	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
found	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
bearers	1
of	1
burdens,	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
to	1
be	1
hewers	1
in	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
overseers	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
work.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
mount	1
Moriah,	1
where	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeared	1
unto	1
David	1
his	1
father,	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
David	1
had	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
threshingfloor	1
of	1
Ornan	1
the	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
3:3	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
wherein	1
Solomon	1
was	1
instructed	1
for	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
The	1
length	1
by	1
cubits	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
measure	1
was	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
twenty	1
cubits.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
porch	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
was	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty:	1
and	1
he	1
overlaid	1
it	1
within	1
with	1
pure	1
gold.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
greater	1
house	1
he	1
cieled	1
with	1
fir	1
tree,	1
which	1
he	1
overlaid	1
with	1
fine	1
gold,	1
and	1
set	1
thereon	1
palm	1
trees	1
and	1
chains.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
he	1
garnished	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
precious	1
stones	1
for	1
beauty:	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
was	1
gold	1
of	1
Parvaim.	1
	1
3:7	1
He	1
overlaid	1
also	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
beams,	1
the	1
posts,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
doors	1
thereof,	1
with	1
gold;	1
and	1
graved	1
cherubims	1
on	1
the	1
walls.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
house,	1
the	1
length	1
whereof	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
twenty	1
cubits:	1
and	1
he	1
overlaid	1
it	1
with	1
fine	1
gold,	1
amounting	1
to	1
six	1
hundred	1
talents.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
nails	1
was	1
fifty	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold.	1
And	1
he	1
overlaid	1
the	1
upper	1
chambers	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
house	1
he	1
made	1
two	1
cherubims	1
of	1
image	1
work,	1
and	1
overlaid	1
them	1
with	1
gold.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims	1
were	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
long:	1
one	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
cherub	1
was	1
five	1
cubits,	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
wing	1
was	1
likewise	1
five	1
cubits,	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
cherub.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
one	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
cherub	1
was	1
five	1
cubits,	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
wing	1
was	1
five	1
cubits	1
also,	1
joining	1
to	1
the	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
cherub.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
wings	1
of	1
these	1
cherubims	1
spread	1
themselves	1
forth	1
twenty	1
cubits:	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
on	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
inward.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
vail	1
of	1
blue,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
crimson,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
wrought	1
cherubims	1
thereon.	1
	1
3:15	1
Also	1
he	1
made	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
two	1
pillars	1
of	1
thirty	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
high,	1
and	1
the	1
chapiter	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
five	1
cubits.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
chains,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
oracle,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
pillars;	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
hundred	1
pomegranates,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
chains.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
the	1
pillars	1
before	1
the	1
temple,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left;	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
Jachin,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
Boaz.	1
	1
4:1	1
Moreover	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
altar	1
of	1
brass,	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
the	1
length	1
thereof,	1
and	1
twenty	1
cubits	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
ten	1
cubits	1
the	1
height	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:2	1
Also	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
molten	1
sea	1
of	1
ten	1
cubits	1
from	1
brim	1
to	1
brim,	1
round	1
in	1
compass,	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
the	1
height	1
thereof;	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
thirty	1
cubits	1
did	1
compass	1
it	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
under	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
oxen,	1
which	1
did	1
compass	1
it	1
round	1
about:	1
ten	1
in	1
a	1
cubit,	1
compassing	1
the	1
sea	1
round	1
about.	1
Two	1
rows	1
of	1
oxen	1
were	1
cast,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
cast.	1
	1
4:4	1
It	1
stood	1
upon	1
twelve	1
oxen,	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
three	1
looking	1
toward	1
the	1
east:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
set	1
above	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
hinder	1
parts	1
were	1
inward.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
thickness	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
handbreadth,	1
and	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
it	1
like	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
a	1
cup,	1
with	1
flowers	1
of	1
lilies;	1
and	1
it	1
received	1
and	1
held	1
three	1
thousand	1
baths.	1
	1
4:6	1
He	1
made	1
also	1
ten	1
lavers,	1
and	1
put	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
to	1
wash	1
in	1
them:	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
offered	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
they	1
washed	1
in	1
them;	1
but	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
to	1
wash	1
in.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
ten	1
candlesticks	1
of	1
gold	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
form,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
made	1
also	1
ten	1
tables,	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
and	1
five	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
hundred	1
basons	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
4:9	1
Furthermore	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
court,	1
and	1
doors	1
for	1
the	1
court,	1
and	1
overlaid	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
brass.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
end,	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
Huram	1
made	1
the	1
pots,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
basons.	1
And	1
Huram	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
king	1
Solomon	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
4:12	1
To	1
wit,	1
the	1
two	1
pillars,	1
and	1
the	1
pommels,	1
and	1
the	1
chapiters	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
pillars,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
wreaths	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
two	1
pommels	1
of	1
the	1
chapiters	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pillars;	1
4:13	1
And	1
four	1
hundred	1
pomegranates	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
wreaths;	1
two	1
rows	1
of	1
pomegranates	1
on	1
each	1
wreath,	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
two	1
pommels	1
of	1
the	1
chapiters	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
pillars.	1
	1
4:14	1
He	1
made	1
also	1
bases,	1
and	1
lavers	1
made	1
he	1
upon	1
the	1
bases;	1
4:15	1
One	1
sea,	1
and	1
twelve	1
oxen	1
under	1
it.	1
	1
4:16	1
The	1
pots	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
shovels,	1
and	1
the	1
fleshhooks,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
instruments,	1
did	1
Huram	1
his	1
father	1
make	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
bright	1
brass.	1
	1
4:17	1
In	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Jordan	1
did	1
the	1
king	1
cast	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
clay	1
ground	1
between	1
Succoth	1
and	1
Zeredathah.	1
	1
4:18	1
Thus	1
Solomon	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
vessels	1
in	1
great	1
abundance:	1
for	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
brass	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
out.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
Solomon	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
whereon	1
the	1
shewbread	1
was	1
set;	1
4:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
candlesticks	1
with	1
their	1
lamps,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
burn	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
before	1
the	1
oracle,	1
of	1
pure	1
gold;	1
4:21	1
And	1
the	1
flowers,	1
and	1
the	1
lamps,	1
and	1
the	1
tongs,	1
made	1
he	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
that	1
perfect	1
gold;	1
4:22	1
And	1
the	1
snuffers,	1
and	1
the	1
basons,	1
and	1
the	1
spoons,	1
and	1
the	1
censers,	1
of	1
pure	1
gold:	1
and	1
the	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
inner	1
doors	1
thereof	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
were	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
5:1	1
Thus	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
Solomon	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
finished:	1
and	1
Solomon	1
brought	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
David	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
dedicated;	1
and	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
instruments,	1
put	1
he	1
among	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:2	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
assembled	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
tribes,	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
Zion.	1
	1
5:3	1
Wherefore	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Israel	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel	1
came;	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
ark.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
congregation,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
these	1
did	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
bring	1
up.	1
	1
5:6	1
Also	1
king	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
assembled	1
unto	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
ark,	1
sacrificed	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
told	1
nor	1
numbered	1
for	1
multitude.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
his	1
place,	1
to	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
place,	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
cherubims:	1
5:8	1
For	1
the	1
cherubims	1
spread	1
forth	1
their	1
wings	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
cherubims	1
covered	1
the	1
ark	1
and	1
the	1
staves	1
thereof	1
above.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
out	1
the	1
staves	1
of	1
the	1
ark,	1
that	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
staves	1
were	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
ark	1
before	1
the	1
oracle;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
seen	1
without.	1
And	1
there	1
it	1
is	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
5:10	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
ark	1
save	1
the	1
two	1
tables	1
which	1
Moses	1
put	1
therein	1
at	1
Horeb,	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
place:	1
(for	1
all	1
the	1
priests	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
were	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
then	1
wait	1
by	1
course:	1
5:12	1
Also	1
the	1
Levites	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
singers,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Asaph,	1
of	1
Heman,	1
of	1
Jeduthun,	1
with	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
brethren,	1
being	1
arrayed	1
in	1
white	1
linen,	1
having	1
cymbals	1
and	1
psalteries	1
and	1
harps,	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
east	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
priests	1
sounding	1
with	1
trumpets:)	1
5:13	1
It	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
trumpeters	1
and	1
singers	1
were	1
as	1
one,	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
sound	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
praising	1
and	1
thanking	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets	1
and	1
cymbals	1
and	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
good;	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever:	1
that	1
then	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
cloud,	1
even	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
5:14	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
priests	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
to	1
minister	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
cloud:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:1	1
Then	1
said	1
Solomon,	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
darkness.	1
	1
6:2	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
habitation	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
turned	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
whole	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel	1
stood.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
hath	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
David,	1
saying,	1
6:5	1
Since	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
brought	1
forth	1
my	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
I	1
chose	1
no	1
city	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
in,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
there;	1
neither	1
chose	1
I	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
6:6	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
there;	1
and	1
have	1
chosen	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
thou	1
didst	1
well	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
thine	1
heart:	1
6:9	1
Notwithstanding	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
build	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
thy	1
son	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
loins,	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
6:10	1
The	1
LORD	1
therefore	1
hath	1
performed	1
his	1
word	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
spoken:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
risen	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
David	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
am	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
promised,	1
and	1
have	1
built	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
in	1
it	1
have	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
ark,	1
wherein	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands:	1
6:13	1
For	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
brasen	1
scaffold	1
of	1
five	1
cubits	1
long,	1
and	1
five	1
cubits	1
broad,	1
and	1
three	1
cubits	1
high,	1
and	1
had	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
court:	1
and	1
upon	1
it	1
he	1
stood,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
toward	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
God	1
like	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
heaven,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
which	1
keepest	1
covenant,	1
and	1
shewest	1
mercy	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
that	1
walk	1
before	1
thee	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
hearts:	1
6:15	1
Thou	1
which	1
hast	1
kept	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
him;	1
and	1
spakest	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
hast	1
fulfilled	1
it	1
with	1
thine	1
hand,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
6:16	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
keep	1
with	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
my	1
father	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
promised	1
him,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
sight	1
to	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Israel;	1
yet	1
so	1
that	1
thy	1
children	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
law,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
walked	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
6:17	1
Now	1
then,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
thy	1
word	1
be	1
verified,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoken	1
unto	1
thy	1
servant	1
David.	1
	1
6:18	1
But	1
will	1
God	1
in	1
very	1
deed	1
dwell	1
with	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
behold,	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
heavens	1
cannot	1
contain	1
thee;	1
how	1
much	1
less	1
this	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built!	1
	1
6:19	1
Have	1
respect	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
supplication,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
cry	1
and	1
the	1
prayer	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
prayeth	1
before	1
thee:	1
6:20	1
That	1
thine	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
open	1
upon	1
this	1
house	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
upon	1
the	1
place	1
whereof	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
put	1
thy	1
name	1
there;	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
the	1
prayer	1
which	1
thy	1
servant	1
prayeth	1
toward	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
6:21	1
Hearken	1
therefore	1
unto	1
the	1
supplications	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
toward	1
this	1
place:	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
even	1
from	1
heaven;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hearest,	1
forgive.	1
	1
6:22	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
sin	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
be	1
laid	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
swear,	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
come	1
before	1
thine	1
altar	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
6:23	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
do,	1
and	1
judge	1
thy	1
servants,	1
by	1
requiting	1
the	1
wicked,	1
by	1
recompensing	1
his	1
way	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
head;	1
and	1
by	1
justifying	1
the	1
righteous,	1
by	1
giving	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
worse	1
before	1
the	1
enemy,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee;	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
and	1
confess	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
pray	1
and	1
make	1
supplication	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
6:25	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
forgive	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
6:26	1
When	1
the	1
heaven	1
is	1
shut	1
up,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rain,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee;	1
yet	1
if	1
they	1
pray	1
toward	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
confess	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
sin,	1
when	1
thou	1
dost	1
afflict	1
them;	1
6:27	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
forgive	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
them	1
the	1
good	1
way,	1
wherein	1
they	1
should	1
walk;	1
and	1
send	1
rain	1
upon	1
thy	1
land,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
unto	1
thy	1
people	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance.	1
	1
6:28	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
dearth	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
pestilence,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
blasting,	1
or	1
mildew,	1
locusts,	1
or	1
caterpillers;	1
if	1
their	1
enemies	1
besiege	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
their	1
land;	1
whatsoever	1
sore	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
sickness	1
there	1
be:	1
6:29	1
Then	1
what	1
prayer	1
or	1
what	1
supplication	1
soever	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
any	1
man,	1
or	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
when	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
know	1
his	1
own	1
sore	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
grief,	1
and	1
shall	1
spread	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
this	1
house:	1
6:30	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
heaven	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
forgive,	1
and	1
render	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
whose	1
heart	1
thou	1
knowest;	1
(for	1
thou	1
only	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men:)	1
6:31	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
fear	1
thee,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
thy	1
ways,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers.	1
	1
6:32	1
Moreover	1
concerning	1
the	1
stranger,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
but	1
is	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
for	1
thy	1
great	1
name's	1
sake,	1
and	1
thy	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
thy	1
stretched	1
out	1
arm;	1
if	1
they	1
come	1
and	1
pray	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
6:33	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
the	1
heavens,	1
even	1
from	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
stranger	1
calleth	1
to	1
thee	1
for;	1
that	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
know	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
fear	1
thee,	1
as	1
doth	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
6:34	1
If	1
thy	1
people	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
their	1
enemies	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
send	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
pray	1
unto	1
thee	1
toward	1
this	1
city	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
thy	1
name;	1
6:35	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
the	1
heavens	1
their	1
prayer	1
and	1
their	1
supplication,	1
and	1
maintain	1
their	1
cause.	1
	1
6:36	1
If	1
they	1
sin	1
against	1
thee,	1
(for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
which	1
sinneth	1
not,)	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
deliver	1
them	1
over	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
and	1
they	1
carry	1
them	1
away	1
captives	1
unto	1
a	1
land	1
far	1
off	1
or	1
near;	1
6:37	1
Yet	1
if	1
they	1
bethink	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
they	1
are	1
carried	1
captive,	1
and	1
turn	1
and	1
pray	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
captivity,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
amiss,	1
and	1
have	1
dealt	1
wickedly;	1
6:38	1
If	1
they	1
return	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
soul	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
captivity,	1
whither	1
they	1
have	1
carried	1
them	1
captives,	1
and	1
pray	1
toward	1
their	1
land,	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
thy	1
name:	1
6:39	1
Then	1
hear	1
thou	1
from	1
the	1
heavens,	1
even	1
from	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
their	1
prayer	1
and	1
their	1
supplications,	1
and	1
maintain	1
their	1
cause,	1
and	1
forgive	1
thy	1
people	1
which	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
6:40	1
Now,	1
my	1
God,	1
let,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
thine	1
eyes	1
be	1
open,	1
and	1
let	1
thine	1
ears	1
be	1
attent	1
unto	1
the	1
prayer	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
6:41	1
Now	1
therefore	1
arise,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
into	1
thy	1
resting	1
place,	1
thou,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
thy	1
strength:	1
let	1
thy	1
priests,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
salvation,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
saints	1
rejoice	1
in	1
goodness.	1
	1
6:42	1
O	1
LORD	1
God,	1
turn	1
not	1
away	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
thine	1
anointed:	1
remember	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
servant.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
praying,	1
the	1
fire	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consumed	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
sacrifices;	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
filled	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
fire	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
upon	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
bowed	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement,	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saying,	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
good;	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
offered	1
sacrifices	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
offered	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
thousand	1
oxen,	1
and	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
sheep:	1
so	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
dedicated	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
waited	1
on	1
their	1
offices:	1
the	1
Levites	1
also	1
with	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
David	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
made	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever,	1
when	1
David	1
praised	1
by	1
their	1
ministry;	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
sounded	1
trumpets	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
stood.	1
	1
7:7	1
Moreover	1
Solomon	1
hallowed	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
there	1
he	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
because	1
the	1
brasen	1
altar	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
fat.	1
	1
7:8	1
Also	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
Solomon	1
kept	1
the	1
feast	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him,	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
congregation,	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hamath	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly:	1
for	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
seven	1
days,	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
three	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
people	1
away	1
into	1
their	1
tents,	1
glad	1
and	1
merry	1
in	1
heart	1
for	1
the	1
goodness	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
shewed	1
unto	1
David,	1
and	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
7:11	1
Thus	1
Solomon	1
finished	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
Solomon's	1
heart	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
he	1
prosperously	1
effected.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
to	1
Solomon	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
prayer,	1
and	1
have	1
chosen	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
myself	1
for	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
7:13	1
If	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
heaven	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
rain,	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
locusts	1
to	1
devour	1
the	1
land,	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
send	1
pestilence	1
among	1
my	1
people;	1
7:14	1
If	1
my	1
people,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
shall	1
humble	1
themselves,	1
and	1
pray,	1
and	1
seek	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
turn	1
from	1
their	1
wicked	1
ways;	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
hear	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
will	1
forgive	1
their	1
sin,	1
and	1
will	1
heal	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
7:15	1
Now	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
be	1
open,	1
and	1
mine	1
ears	1
attent	1
unto	1
the	1
prayer	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
chosen	1
and	1
sanctified	1
this	1
house,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
may	1
be	1
there	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
and	1
mine	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
perpetually.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
thee,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
before	1
me,	1
as	1
David	1
thy	1
father	1
walked,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
thee,	1
and	1
shalt	1
observe	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
judgments;	1
7:18	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
stablish	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
according	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
covenanted	1
with	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
saying,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
fail	1
thee	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:19	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
turn	1
away,	1
and	1
forsake	1
my	1
statutes	1
and	1
my	1
commandments,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worship	1
them;	1
7:20	1
Then	1
will	1
I	1
pluck	1
them	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
and	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
sanctified	1
for	1
my	1
name,	1
will	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
proverb	1
and	1
a	1
byword	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
this	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
high,	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
astonishment	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
by	1
it;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
Why	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
done	1
thus	1
unto	1
this	1
land,	1
and	1
unto	1
this	1
house?	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
answered,	1
Because	1
they	1
forsook	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
them,	1
and	1
served	1
them:	1
therefore	1
hath	1
he	1
brought	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
twenty	1
years,	1
wherein	1
Solomon	1
had	1
built	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
8:2	1
That	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
Huram	1
had	1
restored	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
Solomon	1
built	1
them,	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
dwell	1
there.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
Solomon	1
went	1
to	1
Hamathzobah,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
Tadmor	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
store	1
cities,	1
which	1
he	1
built	1
in	1
Hamath.	1
	1
8:5	1
Also	1
he	1
built	1
Bethhoron	1
the	1
upper,	1
and	1
Bethhoron	1
the	1
nether,	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
with	1
walls,	1
gates,	1
and	1
bars;	1
8:6	1
And	1
Baalath,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
store	1
cities	1
that	1
Solomon	1
had,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chariot	1
cities,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
Solomon	1
desired	1
to	1
build	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
his	1
dominion.	1
	1
8:7	1
As	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Hivites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
Israel,	1
8:8	1
But	1
of	1
their	1
children,	1
who	1
were	1
left	1
after	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
whom	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
consumed	1
not,	1
them	1
did	1
Solomon	1
make	1
to	1
pay	1
tribute	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
Solomon	1
make	1
no	1
servants	1
for	1
his	1
work;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
his	1
captains,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
his	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
king	1
Solomon's	1
officers,	1
even	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty,	1
that	1
bare	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
Solomon	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
for	1
her:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
My	1
wife	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
the	1
places	1
are	1
holy,	1
whereunto	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
come.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
Solomon	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
before	1
the	1
porch,	1
8:13	1
Even	1
after	1
a	1
certain	1
rate	1
every	1
day,	1
offering	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Moses,	1
on	1
the	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
year,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
weeks,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
appointed,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father,	1
the	1
courses	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
to	1
their	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
their	1
charges,	1
to	1
praise	1
and	1
minister	1
before	1
the	1
priests,	1
as	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
required:	1
the	1
porters	1
also	1
by	1
their	1
courses	1
at	1
every	1
gate:	1
for	1
so	1
had	1
David	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
commanded.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
concerning	1
any	1
matter,	1
or	1
concerning	1
the	1
treasures.	1
	1
8:16	1
Now	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Solomon	1
was	1
prepared	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
finished.	1
So	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
perfected.	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
went	1
Solomon	1
to	1
Eziongeber,	1
and	1
to	1
Eloth,	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
side	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
Huram	1
sent	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
ships,	1
and	1
servants	1
that	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Solomon	1
to	1
Ophir,	1
and	1
took	1
thence	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
prove	1
Solomon	1
with	1
hard	1
questions	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
company,	1
and	1
camels	1
that	1
bare	1
spices,	1
and	1
gold	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Solomon,	1
she	1
communed	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
Solomon	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
her	1
questions:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
hid	1
from	1
Solomon	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
not.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
built,	1
9:4	1
And	1
the	1
meat	1
of	1
his	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
sitting	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
attendance	1
of	1
his	1
ministers,	1
and	1
their	1
apparel;	1
his	1
cupbearers	1
also,	1
and	1
their	1
apparel;	1
and	1
his	1
ascent	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
spirit	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
true	1
report	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
land	1
of	1
thine	1
acts,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
wisdom:	1
9:6	1
Howbeit	1
I	1
believed	1
not	1
their	1
words,	1
until	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
mine	1
eyes	1
had	1
seen	1
it:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
wisdom	1
was	1
not	1
told	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
exceedest	1
the	1
fame	1
that	1
I	1
heard.	1
	1
9:7	1
Happy	1
are	1
thy	1
men,	1
and	1
happy	1
are	1
these	1
thy	1
servants,	1
which	1
stand	1
continually	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
hear	1
thy	1
wisdom.	1
	1
9:8	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
delighted	1
in	1
thee	1
to	1
set	1
thee	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God:	1
because	1
thy	1
God	1
loved	1
Israel,	1
to	1
establish	1
them	1
for	1
ever,	1
therefore	1
made	1
he	1
thee	1
king	1
over	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
judgment	1
and	1
justice.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
king	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
talents	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
spices	1
great	1
abundance,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones:	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
such	1
spice	1
as	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
gave	1
king	1
Solomon.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
also	1
of	1
Huram,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
which	1
brought	1
gold	1
from	1
Ophir,	1
brought	1
algum	1
trees	1
and	1
precious	1
stones.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
algum	1
trees	1
terraces	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
palace,	1
and	1
harps	1
and	1
psalteries	1
for	1
singers:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
such	1
seen	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
Sheba	1
all	1
her	1
desire,	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
asked,	1
beside	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
So	1
she	1
turned,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
land,	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
servants.	1
	1
9:13	1
Now	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Solomon	1
in	1
one	1
year	1
was	1
six	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
six	1
talents	1
of	1
gold;	1
9:14	1
Beside	1
that	1
which	1
chapmen	1
and	1
merchants	1
brought.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Arabia	1
and	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
brought	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
to	1
Solomon.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
made	1
two	1
hundred	1
targets	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold:	1
six	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold	1
went	1
to	1
one	1
target.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
three	1
hundred	1
shields	1
made	1
he	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold:	1
three	1
hundred	1
shekels	1
of	1
gold	1
went	1
to	1
one	1
shield.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
9:17	1
Moreover	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
throne	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
overlaid	1
it	1
with	1
pure	1
gold.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
six	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
throne,	1
with	1
a	1
footstool	1
of	1
gold,	1
which	1
were	1
fastened	1
to	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
stays	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
place,	1
and	1
two	1
lions	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
stays:	1
9:19	1
And	1
twelve	1
lions	1
stood	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
six	1
steps.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
like	1
made	1
in	1
any	1
kingdom.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
drinking	1
vessels	1
of	1
king	1
Solomon	1
were	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
were	1
of	1
pure	1
gold:	1
none	1
were	1
of	1
silver;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
accounted	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Solomon.	1
	1
9:21	1
For	1
the	1
king's	1
ships	1
went	1
to	1
Tarshish	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Huram:	1
every	1
three	1
years	1
once	1
came	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Tarshish	1
bringing	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
ivory,	1
and	1
apes,	1
and	1
peacocks.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
king	1
Solomon	1
passed	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
riches	1
and	1
wisdom.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
sought	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
present,	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
raiment,	1
harness,	1
and	1
spices,	1
horses,	1
and	1
mules,	1
a	1
rate	1
year	1
by	1
year.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
Solomon	1
had	1
four	1
thousand	1
stalls	1
for	1
horses	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
horsemen;	1
whom	1
he	1
bestowed	1
in	1
the	1
chariot	1
cities,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
he	1
reigned	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
silver	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
as	1
stones,	1
and	1
cedar	1
trees	1
made	1
he	1
as	1
the	1
sycomore	1
trees	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
low	1
plains	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
Solomon	1
horses	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
lands.	1
	1
9:29	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
Shilonite,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
seer	1
against	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat?	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
Solomon	1
reigned	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
over	1
all	1
Israel	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
9:31	1
And	1
Solomon	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
Rehoboam	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
went	1
to	1
Shechem:	1
for	1
to	1
Shechem	1
were	1
all	1
Israel	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
king.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
whither	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Solomon	1
the	1
king,	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
Jeroboam	1
returned	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
and	1
called	1
him.	1
So	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
Rehoboam,	1
saying,	1
10:4	1
Thy	1
father	1
made	1
our	1
yoke	1
grievous:	1
now	1
therefore	1
ease	1
thou	1
somewhat	1
the	1
grievous	1
servitude	1
of	1
thy	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
heavy	1
yoke	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
serve	1
thee.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
again	1
unto	1
me	1
after	1
three	1
days.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
departed.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
that	1
had	1
stood	1
before	1
Solomon	1
his	1
father	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
lived,	1
saying,	1
What	1
counsel	1
give	1
ye	1
me	1
to	1
return	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
people?	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
please	1
them,	1
and	1
speak	1
good	1
words	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
servants	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
he	1
forsook	1
the	1
counsel	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
gave	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
advice	1
give	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
return	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
people,	1
which	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Ease	1
somewhat	1
the	1
yoke	1
that	1
thy	1
father	1
did	1
put	1
upon	1
us?	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
answer	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
spake	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
father	1
made	1
our	1
yoke	1
heavy,	1
but	1
make	1
thou	1
it	1
somewhat	1
lighter	1
for	1
us;	1
thus	1
shalt	1
thou	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
little	1
finger	1
shall	1
be	1
thicker	1
than	1
my	1
father's	1
loins.	1
	1
10:11	1
For	1
whereas	1
my	1
father	1
put	1
a	1
heavy	1
yoke	1
upon	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
more	1
to	1
your	1
yoke:	1
my	1
father	1
chastised	1
you	1
with	1
whips,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
with	1
scorpions.	1
	1
10:12	1
So	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
Rehoboam	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
bade,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
again	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
answered	1
them	1
roughly;	1
and	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
forsook	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
men,	1
10:14	1
And	1
answered	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
saying,	1
My	1
father	1
made	1
your	1
yoke	1
heavy,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
add	1
thereto:	1
my	1
father	1
chastised	1
you	1
with	1
whips,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
you	1
with	1
scorpions.	1
	1
10:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
was	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
might	1
perform	1
his	1
word,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Ahijah	1
the	1
Shilonite	1
to	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
Israel	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
would	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
them,	1
the	1
people	1
answered	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
What	1
portion	1
have	1
we	1
in	1
David?	1
	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
none	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse:	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
your	1
tents,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
and	1
now,	1
David,	1
see	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house.	1
So	1
all	1
Israel	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
tents.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Rehoboam	1
reigned	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
10:18	1
Then	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
sent	1
Hadoram	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
tribute;	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones,	1
that	1
he	1
died.	1
But	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
made	1
speed	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chariot,	1
to	1
flee	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
Israel	1
rebelled	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
Rehoboam	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
gathered	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
warriors,	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
the	1
kingdom	1
again	1
to	1
Rehoboam.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
saying,	1
11:3	1
Speak	1
unto	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
Israel	1
in	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
saying,	1
11:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
up,	1
nor	1
fight	1
against	1
your	1
brethren:	1
return	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house:	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
is	1
done	1
of	1
me.	1
And	1
they	1
obeyed	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
returned	1
from	1
going	1
against	1
Jeroboam.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
built	1
cities	1
for	1
defence	1
in	1
Judah.	1
	1
11:6	1
He	1
built	1
even	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
Etam,	1
and	1
Tekoa,	1
11:7	1
And	1
Bethzur,	1
and	1
Shoco,	1
and	1
Adullam,	1
11:8	1
And	1
Gath,	1
and	1
Mareshah,	1
and	1
Ziph,	1
11:9	1
And	1
Adoraim,	1
and	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
Azekah,	1
11:10	1
And	1
Zorah,	1
and	1
Aijalon,	1
and	1
Hebron,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
Benjamin	1
fenced	1
cities.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
he	1
fortified	1
the	1
strong	1
holds,	1
and	1
put	1
captains	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
store	1
of	1
victual,	1
and	1
of	1
oil	1
and	1
wine.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
several	1
city	1
he	1
put	1
shields	1
and	1
spears,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
exceeding	1
strong,	1
having	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
on	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
Israel	1
resorted	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
11:14	1
For	1
the	1
Levites	1
left	1
their	1
suburbs	1
and	1
their	1
possession,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
had	1
cast	1
them	1
off	1
from	1
executing	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
11:15	1
And	1
he	1
ordained	1
him	1
priests	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
devils,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
calves	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
after	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
such	1
as	1
set	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
11:17	1
So	1
they	1
strengthened	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
made	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon	1
strong,	1
three	1
years:	1
for	1
three	1
years	1
they	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
Solomon.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
took	1
him	1
Mahalath	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerimoth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
Abihail	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Eliab	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse;	1
11:19	1
Which	1
bare	1
him	1
children;	1
Jeush,	1
and	1
Shamariah,	1
and	1
Zaham.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
after	1
her	1
he	1
took	1
Maachah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Absalom;	1
which	1
bare	1
him	1
Abijah,	1
and	1
Attai,	1
and	1
Ziza,	1
and	1
Shelomith.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
loved	1
Maachah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Absalom	1
above	1
all	1
his	1
wives	1
and	1
his	1
concubines:	1
(for	1
he	1
took	1
eighteen	1
wives,	1
and	1
threescore	1
concubines;	1
and	1
begat	1
twenty	1
and	1
eight	1
sons,	1
and	1
threescore	1
daughters.)	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
made	1
Abijah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Maachah	1
the	1
chief,	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
among	1
his	1
brethren:	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
king.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
he	1
dealt	1
wisely,	1
and	1
dispersed	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
children	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
countries	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
unto	1
every	1
fenced	1
city:	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
victual	1
in	1
abundance.	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
many	1
wives.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Rehoboam	1
had	1
established	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
had	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
he	1
forsook	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
Shishak	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
transgressed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
12:3	1
With	1
twelve	1
hundred	1
chariots,	1
and	1
threescore	1
thousand	1
horsemen:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
without	1
number	1
that	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
the	1
Lubims,	1
the	1
Sukkiims,	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
which	1
pertained	1
to	1
Judah,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:5	1
Then	1
came	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
to	1
Rehoboam,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
because	1
of	1
Shishak,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
left	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Shishak.	1
	1
12:6	1
Whereupon	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
humbled	1
themselves;	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
righteous.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
LORD	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
humbled	1
themselves,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Shemaiah,	1
saying,	1
They	1
have	1
humbled	1
themselves;	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
destroy	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
them	1
some	1
deliverance;	1
and	1
my	1
wrath	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Shishak.	1
	1
12:8	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
servants;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
know	1
my	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
12:9	1
So	1
Shishak	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house;	1
he	1
took	1
all:	1
he	1
carried	1
away	1
also	1
the	1
shields	1
of	1
gold	1
which	1
Solomon	1
had	1
made.	1
	1
12:10	1
Instead	1
of	1
which	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
made	1
shields	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
committed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
guard,	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
guard	1
came	1
and	1
fetched	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
guard	1
chamber.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
humbled	1
himself,	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
turned	1
from	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
destroy	1
him	1
altogether:	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
Judah	1
things	1
went	1
well.	1
	1
12:13	1
So	1
king	1
Rehoboam	1
strengthened	1
himself	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
reigned:	1
for	1
Rehoboam	1
was	1
one	1
and	1
forty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
seventeen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
name	1
there.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Naamah	1
an	1
Ammonitess.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
evil,	1
because	1
he	1
prepared	1
not	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
12:15	1
Now	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Rehoboam,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
seer	1
concerning	1
genealogies?	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
wars	1
between	1
Rehoboam	1
and	1
Jeroboam	1
continually.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
Rehoboam	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Abijah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Jeroboam	1
began	1
Abijah	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
Judah.	1
	1
13:2	1
He	1
reigned	1
three	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Michaiah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Uriel	1
of	1
Gibeah.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
between	1
Abijah	1
and	1
Jeroboam.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
Abijah	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
with	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
valiant	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
even	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men:	1
Jeroboam	1
also	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
eight	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men,	1
being	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
Abijah	1
stood	1
up	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zemaraim,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hear	1
me,	1
thou	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel;	1
13:5	1
Ought	1
ye	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
gave	1
the	1
kingdom	1
over	1
Israel	1
to	1
David	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
by	1
a	1
covenant	1
of	1
salt?	1
	1
13:6	1
Yet	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nebat,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
is	1
risen	1
up,	1
and	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
his	1
lord.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
vain	1
men,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Belial,	1
and	1
have	1
strengthened	1
themselves	1
against	1
Rehoboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Solomon,	1
when	1
Rehoboam	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
tenderhearted,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
withstand	1
them.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
think	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
with	1
your	1
golden	1
calves,	1
which	1
Jeroboam	1
made	1
you	1
for	1
gods.	1
	1
13:9	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
priests	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
other	1
lands?	1
so	1
that	1
whosoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
consecrate	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bullock	1
and	1
seven	1
rams,	1
the	1
same	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
gods.	1
	1
13:10	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
us,	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
forsaken	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
wait	1
upon	1
their	1
business:	1
13:11	1
And	1
they	1
burn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
every	1
morning	1
and	1
every	1
evening	1
burnt	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
sweet	1
incense:	1
the	1
shewbread	1
also	1
set	1
they	1
in	1
order	1
upon	1
the	1
pure	1
table;	1
and	1
the	1
candlestick	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
the	1
lamps	1
thereof,	1
to	1
burn	1
every	1
evening:	1
for	1
we	1
keep	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
him.	1
	1
13:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
God	1
himself	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
our	1
captain,	1
and	1
his	1
priests	1
with	1
sounding	1
trumpets	1
to	1
cry	1
alarm	1
against	1
you.	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
fight	1
ye	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers;	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper.	1
	1
13:13	1
But	1
Jeroboam	1
caused	1
an	1
ambushment	1
to	1
come	1
about	1
behind	1
them:	1
so	1
they	1
were	1
before	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
ambushment	1
was	1
behind	1
them.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
when	1
Judah	1
looked	1
back,	1
behold,	1
the	1
battle	1
was	1
before	1
and	1
behind:	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
sounded	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets.	1
	1
13:15	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
gave	1
a	1
shout:	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
shouted,	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
God	1
smote	1
Jeroboam	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
before	1
Abijah	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
fled	1
before	1
Judah:	1
and	1
God	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
Abijah	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
slew	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter:	1
so	1
there	1
fell	1
down	1
slain	1
of	1
Israel	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
chosen	1
men.	1
	1
13:18	1
Thus	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
brought	1
under	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
prevailed,	1
because	1
they	1
relied	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
Abijah	1
pursued	1
after	1
Jeroboam,	1
and	1
took	1
cities	1
from	1
him,	1
Bethel	1
with	1
the	1
towns	1
thereof,	1
and	1
Jeshanah	1
with	1
the	1
towns	1
thereof,	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
with	1
the	1
towns	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:20	1
Neither	1
did	1
Jeroboam	1
recover	1
strength	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abijah:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
struck	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
13:21	1
But	1
Abijah	1
waxed	1
mighty,	1
and	1
married	1
fourteen	1
wives,	1
and	1
begat	1
twenty	1
and	1
two	1
sons,	1
and	1
sixteen	1
daughters.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Abijah,	1
and	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
his	1
sayings,	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Iddo.	1
	1
14:1	1
So	1
Abijah	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Asa	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
quiet	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
Asa	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God:	1
14:3	1
For	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
altars	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
gods,	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
images,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
groves:	1
14:4	1
And	1
commanded	1
Judah	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
14:5	1
Also	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
the	1
images:	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
was	1
quiet	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
fenced	1
cities	1
in	1
Judah:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
rest,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
war	1
in	1
those	1
years;	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
rest.	1
	1
14:7	1
Therefore	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Judah,	1
Let	1
us	1
build	1
these	1
cities,	1
and	1
make	1
about	1
them	1
walls,	1
and	1
towers,	1
gates,	1
and	1
bars,	1
while	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
yet	1
before	1
us;	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
we	1
have	1
sought	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
rest	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
So	1
they	1
built	1
and	1
prospered.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
Asa	1
had	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
bare	1
targets	1
and	1
spears,	1
out	1
of	1
Judah	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
that	1
bare	1
shields	1
and	1
drew	1
bows,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
against	1
them	1
Zerah	1
the	1
Ethiopian	1
with	1
an	1
host	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
thousand,	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
chariots;	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Mareshah.	1
	1
14:10	1
Then	1
Asa	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
array	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Zephathah	1
at	1
Mareshah.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
Asa	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
LORD,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
with	1
thee	1
to	1
help,	1
whether	1
with	1
many,	1
or	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
power:	1
help	1
us,	1
O	1
LORD	1
our	1
God;	1
for	1
we	1
rest	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
we	1
go	1
against	1
this	1
multitude.	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
art	1
our	1
God;	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
prevail	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
14:12	1
So	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
before	1
Asa,	1
and	1
before	1
Judah;	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
fled.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
Asa	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
pursued	1
them	1
unto	1
Gerar:	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
were	1
overthrown,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
recover	1
themselves;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
destroyed	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
host;	1
and	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
very	1
much	1
spoil.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
Gerar;	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
spoiled	1
all	1
the	1
cities;	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
exceeding	1
much	1
spoil	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
14:15	1
They	1
smote	1
also	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
sheep	1
and	1
camels	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Oded:	1
15:2	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Asa,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hear	1
ye	1
me,	1
Asa,	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin;	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
you,	1
while	1
ye	1
be	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
seek	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
forsake	1
him,	1
he	1
will	1
forsake	1
you.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
season	1
Israel	1
hath	1
been	1
without	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
teaching	1
priest,	1
and	1
without	1
law.	1
	1
15:4	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
in	1
their	1
trouble	1
did	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sought	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
times	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
went	1
out,	1
nor	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
came	1
in,	1
but	1
great	1
vexations	1
were	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
countries.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
nation	1
was	1
destroyed	1
of	1
nation,	1
and	1
city	1
of	1
city:	1
for	1
God	1
did	1
vex	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
adversity.	1
	1
15:7	1
Be	1
ye	1
strong	1
therefore,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
weak:	1
for	1
your	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
rewarded.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
when	1
Asa	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
Oded	1
the	1
prophet,	1
he	1
took	1
courage,	1
and	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
abominable	1
idols	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
renewed	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
the	1
strangers	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Simeon:	1
for	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
Israel	1
in	1
abundance,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
15:10	1
So	1
they	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Asa.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
they	1
offered	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
of	1
the	1
spoil	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
brought,	1
seven	1
hundred	1
oxen	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
sheep.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
covenant	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
soul;	1
15:13	1
That	1
whosoever	1
would	1
not	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
whether	1
small	1
or	1
great,	1
whether	1
man	1
or	1
woman.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
they	1
sware	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
with	1
cornets.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
all	1
Judah	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
the	1
oath:	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
sought	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
desire;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
gave	1
them	1
rest	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
also	1
concerning	1
Maachah	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Asa	1
the	1
king,	1
he	1
removed	1
her	1
from	1
being	1
queen,	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
idol	1
in	1
a	1
grove:	1
and	1
Asa	1
cut	1
down	1
her	1
idol,	1
and	1
stamped	1
it,	1
and	1
burnt	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron.	1
	1
15:17	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
Israel:	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Asa	1
was	1
perfect	1
all	1
his	1
days.	1
	1
15:18	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
dedicated,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
dedicated,	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
vessels.	1
	1
15:19	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
war	1
unto	1
the	1
five	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Asa.	1
	1
16:1	1
In	1
the	1
six	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Asa	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
built	1
Ramah,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
let	1
none	1
go	1
out	1
or	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
16:2	1
Then	1
Asa	1
brought	1
out	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Benhadad	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
saying,	1
16:3	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
league	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
thee,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
between	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
father:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
thee	1
silver	1
and	1
gold;	1
go,	1
break	1
thy	1
league	1
with	1
Baasha	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
Benhadad	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
king	1
Asa,	1
and	1
sent	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
his	1
armies	1
against	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
Ijon,	1
and	1
Dan,	1
and	1
Abelmaim,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
store	1
cities	1
of	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Baasha	1
heard	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
building	1
of	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
work	1
cease.	1
	1
16:6	1
Then	1
Asa	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
all	1
Judah;	1
and	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
Ramah,	1
and	1
the	1
timber	1
thereof,	1
wherewith	1
Baasha	1
was	1
building;	1
and	1
he	1
built	1
therewith	1
Geba	1
and	1
Mizpah.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
Hanani	1
the	1
seer	1
came	1
to	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
relied	1
on	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
not	1
relied	1
on	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God,	1
therefore	1
is	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
16:8	1
Were	1
not	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
and	1
the	1
Lubims	1
a	1
huge	1
host,	1
with	1
very	1
many	1
chariots	1
and	1
horsemen?	1
yet,	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
thine	1
hand.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
to	1
shew	1
himself	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
behalf	1
of	1
them	1
whose	1
heart	1
is	1
perfect	1
toward	1
him.	1
Herein	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
foolishly:	1
therefore	1
from	1
henceforth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
wars.	1
	1
16:10	1
Then	1
Asa	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
seer,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
prison	1
house;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
with	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
thing.	1
And	1
Asa	1
oppressed	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
16:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Asa,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
lo,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
Asa	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
and	1
ninth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
was	1
diseased	1
in	1
his	1
feet,	1
until	1
his	1
disease	1
was	1
exceeding	1
great:	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
disease	1
he	1
sought	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
physicians.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
Asa	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
fortieth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
sepulchres,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
which	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
sweet	1
odours	1
and	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
spices	1
prepared	1
by	1
the	1
apothecaries'	1
art:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
burning	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
himself	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:2	1
And	1
he	1
placed	1
forces	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
set	1
garrisons	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
which	1
Asa	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
taken.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
with	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
because	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
ways	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
David,	1
and	1
sought	1
not	1
unto	1
Baalim;	1
17:4	1
But	1
sought	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
17:5	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
stablished	1
the	1
kingdom	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
brought	1
to	1
Jehoshaphat	1
presents;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
riches	1
and	1
honour	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
moreover	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
groves	1
out	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
17:7	1
Also	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
his	1
princes,	1
even	1
to	1
Benhail,	1
and	1
to	1
Obadiah,	1
and	1
to	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
to	1
Nethaneel,	1
and	1
to	1
Michaiah,	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
sent	1
Levites,	1
even	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
Nethaniah,	1
and	1
Zebadiah,	1
and	1
Asahel,	1
and	1
Shemiramoth,	1
and	1
Jehonathan,	1
and	1
Adonijah,	1
and	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
Tobadonijah,	1
Levites;	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
Elishama	1
and	1
Jehoram,	1
priests.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
they	1
taught	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
taught	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
fell	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
that	1
were	1
round	1
about	1
Judah,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
made	1
no	1
war	1
against	1
Jehoshaphat.	1
	1
17:11	1
Also	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
brought	1
Jehoshaphat	1
presents,	1
and	1
tribute	1
silver;	1
and	1
the	1
Arabians	1
brought	1
him	1
flocks,	1
seven	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rams,	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
he	1
goats.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
waxed	1
great	1
exceedingly;	1
and	1
he	1
built	1
in	1
Judah	1
castles,	1
and	1
cities	1
of	1
store.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
business	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah:	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war,	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
were	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers:	1
Of	1
Judah,	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
thousands;	1
Adnah	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
next	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
Jehohanan	1
the	1
captain,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
next	1
him	1
was	1
Amasiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zichri,	1
who	1
willingly	1
offered	1
himself	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
of	1
Benjamin;	1
Eliada	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
armed	1
men	1
with	1
bow	1
and	1
shield	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
next	1
him	1
was	1
Jehozabad,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
thousand	1
ready	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
17:19	1
These	1
waited	1
on	1
the	1
king,	1
beside	1
those	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judah.	1
	1
18:1	1
Now	1
Jehoshaphat	1
had	1
riches	1
and	1
honour	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
joined	1
affinity	1
with	1
Ahab.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
years	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Ahab	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
And	1
Ahab	1
killed	1
sheep	1
and	1
oxen	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Ramothgilead.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Ramothgilead?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
as	1
thy	1
people;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
war.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Enquire,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
18:5	1
Therefore	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
gathered	1
together	1
of	1
prophets	1
four	1
hundred	1
men,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
Ramothgilead	1
to	1
battle,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
forbear?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Go	1
up;	1
for	1
God	1
will	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
hand.	1
	1
18:6	1
But	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
here	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
besides,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
enquire	1
of	1
him?	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
There	1
is	1
yet	1
one	1
man,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but	1
I	1
hate	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
prophesied	1
good	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
always	1
evil:	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
Micaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imla.	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
said,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
say	1
so.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
called	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
officers,	1
and	1
said,	1
Fetch	1
quickly	1
Micaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imla.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
sat	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
throne,	1
clothed	1
in	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
void	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Samaria;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
18:10	1
And	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Chenaanah	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
horns	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
With	1
these	1
thou	1
shalt	1
push	1
Syria	1
until	1
they	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
prophesied	1
so,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
Ramothgilead,	1
and	1
prosper:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
deliver	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
the	1
messenger	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
call	1
Micaiah	1
spake	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
declare	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
one	1
assent;	1
let	1
thy	1
word	1
therefore,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
be	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
their's,	1
and	1
speak	1
thou	1
good.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
As	1
the	1
LORD	1
liveth,	1
even	1
what	1
my	1
God	1
saith,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Micaiah,	1
shall	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
Ramothgilead	1
to	1
battle,	1
or	1
shall	1
I	1
forbear?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
ye	1
up,	1
and	1
prosper,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
How	1
many	1
times	1
shall	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
say	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
18:16	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
did	1
see	1
all	1
Israel	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
as	1
sheep	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
These	1
have	1
no	1
master;	1
let	1
them	1
return	1
therefore	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
to	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
prophesy	1
good	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
evil?	1
	1
18:18	1
Again	1
he	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD	1
sitting	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
standing	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said,	1
Who	1
shall	1
entice	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
fall	1
at	1
Ramothgilead?	1
And	1
one	1
spake	1
saying	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
saying	1
after	1
that	1
manner.	1
	1
18:20	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
a	1
spirit,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
entice	1
him.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wherewith?	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
be	1
a	1
lying	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets.	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
entice	1
him,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
prevail:	1
go	1
out,	1
and	1
do	1
even	1
so.	1
	1
18:22	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
put	1
a	1
lying	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
these	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
evil	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
18:23	1
Then	1
Zedekiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Chenaanah	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
smote	1
Micaiah	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek,	1
and	1
said,	1
Which	1
way	1
went	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
on	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
into	1
an	1
inner	1
chamber	1
to	1
hide	1
thyself.	1
	1
18:25	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said,	1
Take	1
ye	1
Micaiah,	1
and	1
carry	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
Amon	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
to	1
Joash	1
the	1
king's	1
son;	1
18:26	1
And	1
say,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
king,	1
Put	1
this	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
feed	1
him	1
with	1
bread	1
of	1
affliction	1
and	1
with	1
water	1
of	1
affliction,	1
until	1
I	1
return	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
Micaiah	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
certainly	1
return	1
in	1
peace,	1
then	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken	1
by	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hearken,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
18:28	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Ramothgilead.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
said	1
unto	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
I	1
will	1
disguise	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
battle;	1
but	1
put	1
thou	1
on	1
thy	1
robes.	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
disguised	1
himself;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
18:30	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Fight	1
ye	1
not	1
with	1
small	1
or	1
great,	1
save	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
18:31	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots	1
saw	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
that	1
they	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
Therefore	1
they	1
compassed	1
about	1
him	1
to	1
fight:	1
but	1
Jehoshaphat	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
helped	1
him;	1
and	1
God	1
moved	1
them	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
18:32	1
For	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
from	1
pursuing	1
him.	1
	1
18:33	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
drew	1
a	1
bow	1
at	1
a	1
venture,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
between	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
the	1
harness:	1
therefore	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
chariot	1
man,	1
Turn	1
thine	1
hand,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
carry	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
host;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
wounded.	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
the	1
battle	1
increased	1
that	1
day:	1
howbeit	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
stayed	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
against	1
the	1
Syrians	1
until	1
the	1
even:	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
going	1
down	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
peace	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hanani	1
the	1
seer	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
king	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Shouldest	1
thou	1
help	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
and	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
the	1
LORD?	1
therefore	1
is	1
wrath	1
upon	1
thee	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
19:3	1
Nevertheless	1
there	1
are	1
good	1
things	1
found	1
in	1
thee,	1
in	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
groves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
hast	1
prepared	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
seek	1
God.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
through	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
Beersheba	1
to	1
mount	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
back	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
judges	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
city	1
by	1
city,	1
19:6	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
judges,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
ye	1
do:	1
for	1
ye	1
judge	1
not	1
for	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
is	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
judgment.	1
	1
19:7	1
Wherefore	1
now	1
let	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
upon	1
you;	1
take	1
heed	1
and	1
do	1
it:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
iniquity	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
nor	1
respect	1
of	1
persons,	1
nor	1
taking	1
of	1
gifts.	1
	1
19:8	1
Moreover	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
did	1
Jehoshaphat	1
set	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Israel,	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
for	1
controversies,	1
when	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
faithfully,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
what	1
cause	1
soever	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
cities,	1
between	1
blood	1
and	1
blood,	1
between	1
law	1
and	1
commandment,	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments,	1
ye	1
shall	1
even	1
warn	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
trespass	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
so	1
wrath	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
upon	1
your	1
brethren:	1
this	1
do,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
trespass.	1
	1
19:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
Amariah	1
the	1
chief	1
priest	1
is	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
Zebadiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ishmael,	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
matters:	1
also	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
be	1
officers	1
before	1
you.	1
Deal	1
courageously,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
good.	1
	1
20:1	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this	1
also,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
other	1
beside	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
came	1
against	1
Jehoshaphat	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
some	1
that	1
told	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
saying,	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
against	1
thee	1
from	1
beyond	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
Syria;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
Hazazontamar,	1
which	1
is	1
Engedi.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
feared,	1
and	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judah.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
Judah	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
to	1
ask	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
before	1
the	1
new	1
court,	1
20:6	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
art	1
not	1
thou	1
God	1
in	1
heaven?	1
and	1
rulest	1
not	1
thou	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
heathen?	1
and	1
in	1
thine	1
hand	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
power	1
and	1
might,	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
thee?	1
	1
20:7	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
our	1
God,	1
who	1
didst	1
drive	1
out	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
land	1
before	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
gavest	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham	1
thy	1
friend	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
they	1
dwelt	1
therein,	1
and	1
have	1
built	1
thee	1
a	1
sanctuary	1
therein	1
for	1
thy	1
name,	1
saying,	1
20:9	1
If,	1
when	1
evil	1
cometh	1
upon	1
us,	1
as	1
the	1
sword,	1
judgment,	1
or	1
pestilence,	1
or	1
famine,	1
we	1
stand	1
before	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
presence,	1
(for	1
thy	1
name	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
house,)	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
our	1
affliction,	1
then	1
thou	1
wilt	1
hear	1
and	1
help.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Moab	1
and	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
whom	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not	1
let	1
Israel	1
invade,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
but	1
they	1
turned	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
not;	1
20:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
say,	1
how	1
they	1
reward	1
us,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
cast	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
possession,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
us	1
to	1
inherit.	1
	1
20:12	1
O	1
our	1
God,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
judge	1
them?	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
might	1
against	1
this	1
great	1
company	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
us;	1
neither	1
know	1
we	1
what	1
to	1
do:	1
but	1
our	1
eyes	1
are	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
all	1
Judah	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
with	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
children.	1
	1
20:14	1
Then	1
upon	1
Jahaziel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Benaiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeiel,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mattaniah,	1
a	1
Levite	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Asaph,	1
came	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
congregation;	1
20:15	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Hearken	1
ye,	1
all	1
Judah,	1
and	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
thou	1
king	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
you,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
nor	1
dismayed	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
multitude;	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
is	1
not	1
yours,	1
but	1
God's.	1
	1
20:16	1
To	1
morrow	1
go	1
ye	1
down	1
against	1
them:	1
behold,	1
they	1
come	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
cliff	1
of	1
Ziz;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
brook,	1
before	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Jeruel.	1
	1
20:17	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
need	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
this	1
battle:	1
set	1
yourselves,	1
stand	1
ye	1
still,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
you,	1
O	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem:	1
fear	1
not,	1
nor	1
be	1
dismayed;	1
to	1
morrow	1
go	1
out	1
against	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
fell	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
worshipping	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
Levites,	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Kohathites,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Korhites,	1
stood	1
up	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Tekoa:	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
Jehoshaphat	1
stood	1
and	1
said,	1
Hear	1
me,	1
O	1
Judah,	1
and	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
Believe	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
established;	1
believe	1
his	1
prophets,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
prosper.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
consulted	1
with	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
appointed	1
singers	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
should	1
praise	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
holiness,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
to	1
say,	1
Praise	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
sing	1
and	1
to	1
praise,	1
the	1
LORD	1
set	1
ambushments	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
Moab,	1
and	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
against	1
Judah;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
smitten.	1
	1
20:23	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
and	1
Moab	1
stood	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
mount	1
Seir,	1
utterly	1
to	1
slay	1
and	1
destroy	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Seir,	1
every	1
one	1
helped	1
to	1
destroy	1
another.	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
when	1
Judah	1
came	1
toward	1
the	1
watch	1
tower	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
they	1
looked	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
were	1
dead	1
bodies	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
none	1
escaped.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
when	1
Jehoshaphat	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
them,	1
they	1
found	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
abundance	1
both	1
riches	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
bodies,	1
and	1
precious	1
jewels,	1
which	1
they	1
stripped	1
off	1
for	1
themselves,	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
could	1
carry	1
away:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
spoil,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Berachah;	1
for	1
there	1
they	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD:	1
therefore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
was	1
called,	1
The	1
valley	1
of	1
Berachah,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
they	1
returned,	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
Jehoshaphat	1
in	1
the	1
forefront	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
go	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
joy;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
to	1
rejoice	1
over	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
psalteries	1
and	1
harps	1
and	1
trumpets	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
those	1
countries,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:30	1
So	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
was	1
quiet:	1
for	1
his	1
God	1
gave	1
him	1
rest	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
Jehoshaphat	1
reigned	1
over	1
Judah:	1
he	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Azubah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Shilhi.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Asa	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
it,	1
doing	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:33	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
were	1
not	1
taken	1
away:	1
for	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
not	1
prepared	1
their	1
hearts	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
20:34	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hanani,	1
who	1
is	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
20:35	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
did	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
join	1
himself	1
with	1
Ahaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
did	1
very	1
wickedly:	1
20:36	1
And	1
he	1
joined	1
himself	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
ships	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Tarshish:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
ships	1
in	1
Eziongaber.	1
	1
20:37	1
Then	1
Eliezer	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Dodavah	1
of	1
Mareshah	1
prophesied	1
against	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
saying,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
joined	1
thyself	1
with	1
Ahaziah,	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
broken	1
thy	1
works.	1
And	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
broken,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Tarshish.	1
	1
21:1	1
Now	1
Jehoshaphat	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
Jehoram	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
brethren	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
Azariah,	1
and	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
and	1
Michael,	1
and	1
Shephatiah:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
their	1
father	1
gave	1
them	1
great	1
gifts	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
precious	1
things,	1
with	1
fenced	1
cities	1
in	1
Judah:	1
but	1
the	1
kingdom	1
gave	1
he	1
to	1
Jehoram;	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
firstborn.	1
	1
21:4	1
Now	1
when	1
Jehoram	1
was	1
risen	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
his	1
brethren	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
divers	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
21:5	1
Jehoram	1
was	1
thirty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eight	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
like	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Ahab	1
to	1
wife:	1
and	1
he	1
wrought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
21:7	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
LORD	1
would	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
David,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
sons	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
21:8	1
In	1
his	1
days	1
the	1
Edomites	1
revolted	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
dominion	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
made	1
themselves	1
a	1
king.	1
	1
21:9	1
Then	1
Jehoram	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
chariots	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Edomites	1
which	1
compassed	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
chariots.	1
	1
21:10	1
So	1
the	1
Edomites	1
revolted	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Judah	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
same	1
time	1
also	1
did	1
Libnah	1
revolt	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
hand;	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
21:11	1
Moreover	1
he	1
made	1
high	1
places	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
caused	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
and	1
compelled	1
Judah	1
thereto.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
writing	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
Elijah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
David	1
thy	1
father,	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat	1
thy	1
father,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
Asa	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
21:13	1
But	1
hast	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
whoring,	1
like	1
to	1
the	1
whoredoms	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
also	1
hast	1
slain	1
thy	1
brethren	1
of	1
thy	1
father's	1
house,	1
which	1
were	1
better	1
than	1
thyself:	1
21:14	1
Behold,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
plague	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
smite	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
thy	1
children,	1
and	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
goods:	1
21:15	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
great	1
sickness	1
by	1
disease	1
of	1
thy	1
bowels,	1
until	1
thy	1
bowels	1
fall	1
out	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
sickness	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
21:16	1
Moreover	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
against	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Arabians,	1
that	1
were	1
near	1
the	1
Ethiopians:	1
21:17	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
into	1
Judah,	1
and	1
brake	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
also,	1
and	1
his	1
wives;	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
never	1
a	1
son	1
left	1
him,	1
save	1
Jehoahaz,	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
LORD	1
smote	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
bowels	1
with	1
an	1
incurable	1
disease.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time,	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
years,	1
his	1
bowels	1
fell	1
out	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
sickness:	1
so	1
he	1
died	1
of	1
sore	1
diseases.	1
And	1
his	1
people	1
made	1
no	1
burning	1
for	1
him,	1
like	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
21:20	1
Thirty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
eight	1
years,	1
and	1
departed	1
without	1
being	1
desired.	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
kings.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
made	1
Ahaziah	1
his	1
youngest	1
son	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
stead:	1
for	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
that	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
Arabians	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
had	1
slain	1
all	1
the	1
eldest.	1
So	1
Ahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoram	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
reigned.	1
	1
22:2	1
Forty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
Ahaziah	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
one	1
year	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Athaliah	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Omri.	1
	1
22:3	1
He	1
also	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
his	1
mother	1
was	1
his	1
counsellor	1
to	1
do	1
wickedly.	1
	1
22:4	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
did	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
like	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
counsellors	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
his	1
destruction.	1
	1
22:5	1
He	1
walked	1
also	1
after	1
their	1
counsel,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
to	1
war	1
against	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria	1
at	1
Ramothgilead:	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
smote	1
Joram.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
in	1
Jezreel	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
which	1
were	1
given	1
him	1
at	1
Ramah,	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
with	1
Hazael	1
king	1
of	1
Syria.	1
And	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoram	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
Jehoram	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahab	1
at	1
Jezreel,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
sick.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
was	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
coming	1
to	1
Joram:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
Jehoram	1
against	1
Jehu	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nimshi,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
anointed	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Jehu	1
was	1
executing	1
judgment	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
Ahaziah,	1
that	1
ministered	1
to	1
Ahaziah,	1
he	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
Ahaziah:	1
and	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
hid	1
in	1
Samaria,)	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jehu:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
him,	1
they	1
buried	1
him:	1
Because,	1
said	1
they,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
who	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart.	1
So	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
keep	1
still	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
22:10	1
But	1
when	1
Athaliah	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Ahaziah	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
was	1
dead,	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
seed	1
royal	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
22:11	1
But	1
Jehoshabeath,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
took	1
Joash	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahaziah,	1
and	1
stole	1
him	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
king's	1
sons	1
that	1
were	1
slain,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
nurse	1
in	1
a	1
bedchamber.	1
So	1
Jehoshabeath,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
king	1
Jehoram,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
(for	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Ahaziah,)	1
hid	1
him	1
from	1
Athaliah,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
slew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
six	1
years:	1
and	1
Athaliah	1
reigned	1
over	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
Jehoiada	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeroham,	1
and	1
Ishmael	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehohanan,	1
and	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Obed,	1
and	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Adaiah,	1
and	1
Elishaphat	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zichri,	1
into	1
covenant	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
Levites	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
king's	1
son	1
shall	1
reign,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
23:4	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do;	1
A	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
you	1
entering	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
shall	1
be	1
porters	1
of	1
the	1
doors;	1
23:5	1
And	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
house;	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
foundation:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
let	1
none	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
save	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
Levites;	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
in,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
holy:	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
shall	1
compass	1
the	1
king	1
round	1
about,	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
weapons	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
else	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death:	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
in,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
goeth	1
out.	1
	1
23:8	1
So	1
the	1
Levites	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
had	1
commanded,	1
and	1
took	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath:	1
for	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
dismissed	1
not	1
the	1
courses.	1
	1
23:9	1
Moreover	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds	1
spears,	1
and	1
bucklers,	1
and	1
shields,	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
king	1
David's,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
every	1
man	1
having	1
his	1
weapon	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
along	1
by	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
temple,	1
by	1
the	1
king	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
23:11	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
king's	1
son,	1
and	1
put	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
crown,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
testimony,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king.	1
And	1
Jehoiada	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
anointed	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
God	1
save	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
23:12	1
Now	1
when	1
Athaliah	1
heard	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
running	1
and	1
praising	1
the	1
king,	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
23:13	1
And	1
she	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
pillar	1
at	1
the	1
entering	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
by	1
the	1
king:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
sounded	1
with	1
trumpets,	1
also	1
the	1
singers	1
with	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
taught	1
to	1
sing	1
praise.	1
Then	1
Athaliah	1
rent	1
her	1
clothes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Treason,	1
Treason.	1
	1
23:14	1
Then	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds	1
that	1
were	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
her	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
ranges:	1
and	1
whoso	1
followeth	1
her,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
For	1
the	1
priest	1
said,	1
Slay	1
her	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
23:15	1
So	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
entering	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
gate	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
they	1
slew	1
her	1
there.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
Jehoiada	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
between	1
him,	1
and	1
between	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's	1
people.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baal,	1
and	1
brake	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
brake	1
his	1
altars	1
and	1
his	1
images	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
slew	1
Mattan	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Baal	1
before	1
the	1
altars.	1
	1
23:18	1
Also	1
Jehoiada	1
appointed	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites,	1
whom	1
David	1
had	1
distributed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
with	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
with	1
singing,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
by	1
David.	1
	1
23:19	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
porters	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
none	1
which	1
was	1
unclean	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
should	1
enter	1
in.	1
	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
the	1
nobles,	1
and	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
brought	1
down	1
the	1
king	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
high	1
gate	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
king	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
rejoiced:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
quiet,	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
slain	1
Athaliah	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
24:1	1
Joash	1
was	1
seven	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Zibiah	1
of	1
Beersheba.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Joash	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
Jehoiada	1
took	1
for	1
him	1
two	1
wives;	1
and	1
he	1
begat	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
after	1
this,	1
that	1
Joash	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:5	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
Go	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
gather	1
of	1
all	1
Israel	1
money	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
hasten	1
the	1
matter.	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
Levites	1
hastened	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
called	1
for	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
chief,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
required	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
out	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
collection,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Israel,	1
for	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness?	1
	1
24:7	1
For	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Athaliah,	1
that	1
wicked	1
woman,	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
dedicated	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
did	1
they	1
bestow	1
upon	1
Baalim.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
chest,	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
through	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
collection	1
that	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
laid	1
upon	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
brought	1
in,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
chest,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
24:11	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
the	1
chest	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
office	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
money,	1
the	1
king's	1
scribe	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
officer	1
came	1
and	1
emptied	1
the	1
chest,	1
and	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
again.	1
Thus	1
they	1
did	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
gathered	1
money	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Jehoiada	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
hired	1
masons	1
and	1
carpenters	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
also	1
such	1
as	1
wrought	1
iron	1
and	1
brass	1
to	1
mend	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:13	1
So	1
the	1
workmen	1
wrought,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
perfected	1
by	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
state,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
it.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
finished	1
it,	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
Jehoiada,	1
whereof	1
were	1
made	1
vessels	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
vessels	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
offer	1
withal,	1
and	1
spoons,	1
and	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver.	1
And	1
they	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
continually	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jehoiada.	1
	1
24:15	1
But	1
Jehoiada	1
waxed	1
old,	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
days	1
when	1
he	1
died;	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
he	1
when	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
among	1
the	1
kings,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
good	1
in	1
Israel,	1
both	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
toward	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
24:17	1
Now	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
came	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
made	1
obeisance	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
served	1
groves	1
and	1
idols:	1
and	1
wrath	1
came	1
upon	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
this	1
their	1
trespass.	1
	1
24:19	1
Yet	1
he	1
sent	1
prophets	1
to	1
them,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
testified	1
against	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
ear.	1
	1
24:20	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
upon	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
which	1
stood	1
above	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
God,	1
Why	1
transgress	1
ye	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
prosper?	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD,	1
he	1
hath	1
also	1
forsaken	1
you.	1
	1
24:21	1
And	1
they	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him	1
with	1
stones	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
24:22	1
Thus	1
Joash	1
the	1
king	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
kindness	1
which	1
Jehoiada	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
slew	1
his	1
son.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
require	1
it.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year,	1
that	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
Syria	1
came	1
up	1
against	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
sent	1
all	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Damascus.	1
	1
24:24	1
For	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Syrians	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
company	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
delivered	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
host	1
into	1
their	1
hand,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
So	1
they	1
executed	1
judgment	1
against	1
Joash.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
(for	1
they	1
left	1
him	1
in	1
great	1
diseases,)	1
his	1
own	1
servants	1
conspired	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
he	1
died:	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
but	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
kings.	1
	1
24:26	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
conspired	1
against	1
him;	1
Zabad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimeath	1
an	1
Ammonitess,	1
and	1
Jehozabad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimrith	1
a	1
Moabitess.	1
	1
24:27	1
Now	1
concerning	1
his	1
sons,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
burdens	1
laid	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
repairing	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings.	1
And	1
Amaziah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
25:1	1
Amaziah	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
twenty	1
and	1
nine	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Jehoaddan	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
perfect	1
heart.	1
	1
25:3	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
kingdom	1
was	1
established	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
slew	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
25:4	1
But	1
he	1
slew	1
not	1
their	1
children,	1
but	1
did	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses,	1
where	1
the	1
LORD	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
The	1
fathers	1
shall	1
not	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
children,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
fathers,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
die	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sin.	1
	1
25:5	1
Moreover	1
Amaziah	1
gathered	1
Judah	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
captains	1
over	1
thousands,	1
and	1
captains	1
over	1
hundreds,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin:	1
and	1
he	1
numbered	1
them	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
above,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
choice	1
men,	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
to	1
war,	1
that	1
could	1
handle	1
spear	1
and	1
shield.	1
	1
25:6	1
He	1
hired	1
also	1
an	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour	1
out	1
of	1
Israel	1
for	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
25:7	1
But	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
O	1
king,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Israel	1
go	1
with	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
Israel,	1
to	1
wit,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
25:8	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
go,	1
do	1
it;	1
be	1
strong	1
for	1
the	1
battle:	1
God	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
fall	1
before	1
the	1
enemy:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
help,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
down.	1
	1
25:9	1
And	1
Amaziah	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
But	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
hundred	1
talents	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Israel?	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
answered,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
this.	1
	1
25:10	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
separated	1
them,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
army	1
that	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
again:	1
wherefore	1
their	1
anger	1
was	1
greatly	1
kindled	1
against	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
in	1
great	1
anger.	1
	1
25:11	1
And	1
Amaziah	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
led	1
forth	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
salt,	1
and	1
smote	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Seir	1
ten	1
thousand.	1
	1
25:12	1
And	1
other	1
ten	1
thousand	1
left	1
alive	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
carry	1
away	1
captive,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
were	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
25:13	1
But	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
Amaziah	1
sent	1
back,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
battle,	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
from	1
Samaria	1
even	1
unto	1
Bethhoron,	1
and	1
smote	1
three	1
thousand	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
much	1
spoil.	1
	1
25:14	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
after	1
that	1
Amaziah	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
Edomites,	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Seir,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
gods,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
himself	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
25:15	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
Amaziah,	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
prophet,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
sought	1
after	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
deliver	1
their	1
own	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand?	1
	1
25:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
counsel?	1
forbear;	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
be	1
smitten?	1
Then	1
the	1
prophet	1
forbare,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
determined	1
to	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
this,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
my	1
counsel.	1
	1
25:17	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
took	1
advice,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Joash,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
25:18	1
And	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
sent	1
to	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
The	1
thistle	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
cedar	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
saying,	1
Give	1
thy	1
daughter	1
to	1
my	1
son	1
to	1
wife:	1
and	1
there	1
passed	1
by	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Lebanon,	1
and	1
trode	1
down	1
the	1
thistle.	1
	1
25:19	1
Thou	1
sayest,	1
Lo,	1
thou	1
hast	1
smitten	1
the	1
Edomites;	1
and	1
thine	1
heart	1
lifteth	1
thee	1
up	1
to	1
boast:	1
abide	1
now	1
at	1
home;	1
why	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
meddle	1
to	1
thine	1
hurt,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
fall,	1
even	1
thou,	1
and	1
Judah	1
with	1
thee?	1
	1
25:20	1
But	1
Amaziah	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
for	1
it	1
came	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
because	1
they	1
sought	1
after	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Edom.	1
	1
25:21	1
So	1
Joash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
went	1
up;	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
at	1
Bethshemesh,	1
which	1
belongeth	1
to	1
Judah.	1
	1
25:22	1
And	1
Judah	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
worse	1
before	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
fled	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
tent.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
Joash	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
took	1
Amaziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz,	1
at	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
four	1
hundred	1
cubits.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
Obededom,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
the	1
hostages	1
also,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
25:25	1
And	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
lived	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Joash	1
son	1
of	1
Jehoahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
	1
25:26	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Amaziah,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
behold,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel?	1
	1
25:27	1
Now	1
after	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
Amaziah	1
did	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
him	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
he	1
fled	1
to	1
Lachish:	1
but	1
they	1
sent	1
to	1
Lachish	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
25:28	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
upon	1
horses,	1
and	1
buried	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
26:1	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah	1
took	1
Uzziah,	1
who	1
was	1
sixteen	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Amaziah.	1
	1
26:2	1
He	1
built	1
Eloth,	1
and	1
restored	1
it	1
to	1
Judah,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
26:3	1
Sixteen	1
years	1
old	1
was	1
Uzziah	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
fifty	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Jecoliah	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
26:4	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
Amaziah	1
did.	1
	1
26:5	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Zechariah,	1
who	1
had	1
understanding	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
God	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
prosper.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
and	1
warred	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Gath,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jabneh,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
built	1
cities	1
about	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
26:7	1
And	1
God	1
helped	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
Arabians	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Gurbaal,	1
and	1
the	1
Mehunims.	1
	1
26:8	1
And	1
the	1
Ammonites	1
gave	1
gifts	1
to	1
Uzziah:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
spread	1
abroad	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
for	1
he	1
strengthened	1
himself	1
exceedingly.	1
	1
26:9	1
Moreover	1
Uzziah	1
built	1
towers	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
valley	1
gate,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
turning	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
fortified	1
them.	1
	1
26:10	1
Also	1
he	1
built	1
towers	1
in	1
the	1
desert,	1
and	1
digged	1
many	1
wells:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
much	1
cattle,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
low	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
plains:	1
husbandmen	1
also,	1
and	1
vine	1
dressers	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
Carmel:	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
husbandry.	1
	1
26:11	1
Moreover	1
Uzziah	1
had	1
an	1
host	1
of	1
fighting	1
men,	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
war	1
by	1
bands,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
account	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Jeiel	1
the	1
scribe	1
and	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
ruler,	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Hananiah,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
captains.	1
	1
26:12	1
The	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour	1
were	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred.	1
	1
26:13	1
And	1
under	1
their	1
hand	1
was	1
an	1
army,	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred,	1
that	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
mighty	1
power,	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
king	1
against	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
Uzziah	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
shields,	1
and	1
spears,	1
and	1
helmets,	1
and	1
habergeons,	1
and	1
bows,	1
and	1
slings	1
to	1
cast	1
stones.	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
engines,	1
invented	1
by	1
cunning	1
men,	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
towers	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
bulwarks,	1
to	1
shoot	1
arrows	1
and	1
great	1
stones	1
withal.	1
	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
spread	1
far	1
abroad;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
marvellously	1
helped,	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
strong.	1
	1
26:16	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
strong,	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
destruction:	1
for	1
he	1
transgressed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
26:17	1
And	1
Azariah	1
the	1
priest	1
went	1
in	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
fourscore	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
were	1
valiant	1
men:	1
26:18	1
And	1
they	1
withstood	1
Uzziah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
appertaineth	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Uzziah,	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
that	1
are	1
consecrated	1
to	1
burn	1
incense:	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
trespassed;	1
neither	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
thine	1
honour	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
God.	1
	1
26:19	1
Then	1
Uzziah	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
censer	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
burn	1
incense:	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
leprosy	1
even	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
forehead	1
before	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
from	1
beside	1
the	1
incense	1
altar.	1
	1
26:20	1
And	1
Azariah	1
the	1
chief	1
priest,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
priests,	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
was	1
leprous	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
they	1
thrust	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
thence;	1
yea,	1
himself	1
hasted	1
also	1
to	1
go	1
out,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
smitten	1
him.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
Uzziah	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
a	1
leper	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
several	1
house,	1
being	1
a	1
leper;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
Jotham	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
judging	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
26:22	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
did	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
write.	1
	1
26:23	1
So	1
Uzziah	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
burial	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
kings;	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
leper:	1
and	1
Jotham	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
27:1	1
Jotham	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
His	1
mother's	1
name	1
also	1
was	1
Jerushah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zadok.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
Uzziah	1
did:	1
howbeit	1
he	1
entered	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
yet	1
corruptly.	1
	1
27:3	1
He	1
built	1
the	1
high	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Ophel	1
he	1
built	1
much.	1
	1
27:4	1
Moreover	1
he	1
built	1
cities	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
he	1
built	1
castles	1
and	1
towers.	1
	1
27:5	1
He	1
fought	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them.	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
year	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
of	1
barley.	1
So	1
much	1
did	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
pay	1
unto	1
him,	1
both	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
and	1
the	1
third.	1
	1
27:6	1
So	1
Jotham	1
became	1
mighty,	1
because	1
he	1
prepared	1
his	1
ways	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
27:7	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
wars,	1
and	1
his	1
ways,	1
lo,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
27:8	1
He	1
was	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
27:9	1
And	1
Jotham	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
Ahaz	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
28:1	1
Ahaz	1
was	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
sixteen	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
28:2	1
For	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
made	1
also	1
molten	1
images	1
for	1
Baalim.	1
	1
28:3	1
Moreover	1
he	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom,	1
and	1
burnt	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
after	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
28:4	1
He	1
sacrificed	1
also	1
and	1
burnt	1
incense	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
hills,	1
and	1
under	1
every	1
green	1
tree.	1
	1
28:5	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
delivered	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Syria;	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
captives,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Damascus.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
slaughter.	1
	1
28:6	1
For	1
Pekah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Remaliah	1
slew	1
in	1
Judah	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
which	1
were	1
all	1
valiant	1
men;	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
forsaken	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
28:7	1
And	1
Zichri,	1
a	1
mighty	1
man	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
slew	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
king's	1
son,	1
and	1
Azrikam	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
Elkanah	1
that	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
women,	1
sons,	1
and	1
daughters,	1
and	1
took	1
also	1
away	1
much	1
spoil	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
spoil	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
28:9	1
But	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
there,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Oded:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
host	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
Judah,	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
your	1
hand,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
rage	1
that	1
reacheth	1
up	1
unto	1
heaven.	1
	1
28:10	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
purpose	1
to	1
keep	1
under	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
bondmen	1
and	1
bondwomen	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
are	1
there	1
not	1
with	1
you,	1
even	1
with	1
you,	1
sins	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God?	1
	1
28:11	1
Now	1
hear	1
me	1
therefore,	1
and	1
deliver	1
the	1
captives	1
again,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
captive	1
of	1
your	1
brethren:	1
for	1
the	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
28:12	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Johanan,	1
Berechiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Meshillemoth,	1
and	1
Jehizkiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shallum,	1
and	1
Amasa	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hadlai,	1
stood	1
up	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
war,	1
28:13	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
captives	1
hither:	1
for	1
whereas	1
we	1
have	1
offended	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
already,	1
ye	1
intend	1
to	1
add	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
sins	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
trespass:	1
for	1
our	1
trespass	1
is	1
great,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
against	1
Israel.	1
	1
28:14	1
So	1
the	1
armed	1
men	1
left	1
the	1
captives	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
before	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
expressed	1
by	1
name	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
spoil	1
clothed	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
naked	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
them,	1
and	1
shod	1
them,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
anointed	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
all	1
the	1
feeble	1
of	1
them	1
upon	1
asses,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
Jericho,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
to	1
their	1
brethren:	1
then	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Samaria.	1
	1
28:16	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
did	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
send	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
28:17	1
For	1
again	1
the	1
Edomites	1
had	1
come	1
and	1
smitten	1
Judah,	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
captives.	1
	1
28:18	1
The	1
Philistines	1
also	1
had	1
invaded	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
country,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
Bethshemesh,	1
and	1
Ajalon,	1
and	1
Gederoth,	1
and	1
Shocho	1
with	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof,	1
and	1
Timnah	1
with	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof,	1
Gimzo	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
villages	1
thereof:	1
and	1
they	1
dwelt	1
there.	1
	1
28:19	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
Judah	1
low	1
because	1
of	1
Ahaz	1
king	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
made	1
Judah	1
naked,	1
and	1
transgressed	1
sore	1
against	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
28:20	1
And	1
Tilgathpilneser	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
distressed	1
him,	1
but	1
strengthened	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
28:21	1
For	1
Ahaz	1
took	1
away	1
a	1
portion	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
but	1
he	1
helped	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
28:22	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
distress	1
did	1
he	1
trespass	1
yet	1
more	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
king	1
Ahaz.	1
	1
28:23	1
For	1
he	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
which	1
smote	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Because	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Syria	1
help	1
them,	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
help	1
me.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
Ahaz	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
altars	1
in	1
every	1
corner	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
28:25	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
several	1
city	1
of	1
Judah	1
he	1
made	1
high	1
places	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
provoked	1
to	1
anger	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
	1
28:26	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
acts	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
28:27	1
And	1
Ahaz	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
even	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
Hezekiah	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
29:1	1
Hezekiah	1
began	1
to	1
reign	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
nine	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
And	1
his	1
mother's	1
name	1
was	1
Abijah,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zechariah.	1
	1
29:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
David	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
29:3	1
He	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
repaired	1
them.	1
	1
29:4	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
east	1
street,	1
29:5	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear	1
me,	1
ye	1
Levites,	1
sanctify	1
now	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
carry	1
forth	1
the	1
filthiness	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
29:6	1
For	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
trespassed,	1
and	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
forsaken	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
turned	1
away	1
their	1
faces	1
from	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
turned	1
their	1
backs.	1
	1
29:7	1
Also	1
they	1
have	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
porch,	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
lamps,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
burned	1
incense	1
nor	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:8	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
upon	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
trouble,	1
to	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
to	1
hissing,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
with	1
your	1
eyes.	1
	1
29:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
fallen	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
our	1
sons	1
and	1
our	1
daughters	1
and	1
our	1
wives	1
are	1
in	1
captivity	1
for	1
this.	1
	1
29:10	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
his	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
may	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
29:11	1
My	1
sons,	1
be	1
not	1
now	1
negligent:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
chosen	1
you	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
to	1
serve	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
minister	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense.	1
	1
29:12	1
Then	1
the	1
Levites	1
arose,	1
Mahath	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amasai,	1
and	1
Joel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azariah,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Kohathites:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari,	1
Kish	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Abdi,	1
and	1
Azariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehalelel:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Gershonites;	1
Joah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zimmah,	1
and	1
Eden	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joah:	1
29:13	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Elizaphan;	1
Shimri,	1
and	1
Jeiel:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Asaph;	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Mattaniah:	1
29:14	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Heman;	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Shimei:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jeduthun;	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
Uzziel.	1
	1
29:15	1
And	1
they	1
gathered	1
their	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
themselves,	1
and	1
came,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:16	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
cleanse	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
that	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
took	1
it,	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
out	1
abroad	1
into	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron.	1
	1
29:17	1
Now	1
they	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
to	1
sanctify,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
came	1
they	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
so	1
they	1
sanctified	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
eight	1
days;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
they	1
made	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
29:18	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
cleansed	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
shewbread	1
table,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
thereof.	1
	1
29:19	1
Moreover	1
all	1
the	1
vessels,	1
which	1
king	1
Ahaz	1
in	1
his	1
reign	1
did	1
cast	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
transgression,	1
have	1
we	1
prepared	1
and	1
sanctified,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
before	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:20	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:21	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
seven	1
bullocks,	1
and	1
seven	1
rams,	1
and	1
seven	1
lambs,	1
and	1
seven	1
he	1
goats,	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
for	1
Judah.	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
to	1
offer	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:22	1
So	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
bullocks,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
received	1
the	1
blood,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
altar:	1
likewise,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
the	1
rams,	1
they	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
they	1
killed	1
also	1
the	1
lambs,	1
and	1
they	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
29:23	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
he	1
goats	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
congregation;	1
and	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
upon	1
them:	1
29:24	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
killed	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
their	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
altar,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
atonement	1
for	1
all	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
offering	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
all	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:25	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
cymbals,	1
with	1
psalteries,	1
and	1
with	1
harps,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
of	1
Gad	1
the	1
king's	1
seer,	1
and	1
Nathan	1
the	1
prophet:	1
for	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
his	1
prophets.	1
	1
29:26	1
And	1
the	1
Levites	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets.	1
	1
29:27	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
commanded	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
upon	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
began,	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
began	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
instruments	1
ordained	1
by	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
29:28	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
worshipped,	1
and	1
the	1
singers	1
sang,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpeters	1
sounded:	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
continued	1
until	1
the	1
burnt	1
offering	1
was	1
finished.	1
	1
29:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
offering,	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
with	1
him	1
bowed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
29:30	1
Moreover	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
commanded	1
the	1
Levites	1
to	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
of	1
Asaph	1
the	1
seer.	1
And	1
they	1
sang	1
praises	1
with	1
gladness,	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
worshipped.	1
	1
29:31	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Now	1
ye	1
have	1
consecrated	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
come	1
near	1
and	1
bring	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
thank	1
offerings	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
the	1
congregation	1
brought	1
in	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
thank	1
offerings;	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
heart	1
burnt	1
offerings.	1
	1
29:32	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
which	1
the	1
congregation	1
brought,	1
was	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
bullocks,	1
an	1
hundred	1
rams,	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
lambs:	1
all	1
these	1
were	1
for	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
29:33	1
And	1
the	1
consecrated	1
things	1
were	1
six	1
hundred	1
oxen	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
sheep.	1
	1
29:34	1
But	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
too	1
few,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
flay	1
all	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings:	1
wherefore	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites	1
did	1
help	1
them,	1
till	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
ended,	1
and	1
until	1
the	1
other	1
priests	1
had	1
sanctified	1
themselves:	1
for	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
more	1
upright	1
in	1
heart	1
to	1
sanctify	1
themselves	1
than	1
the	1
priests.	1
	1
29:35	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
were	1
in	1
abundance,	1
with	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offerings	1
for	1
every	1
burnt	1
offering.	1
So	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
29:36	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
prepared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
done	1
suddenly.	1
	1
30:1	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
sent	1
to	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
wrote	1
letters	1
also	1
to	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
30:2	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
taken	1
counsel,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month.	1
	1
30:3	1
For	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
priests	1
had	1
not	1
sanctified	1
themselves	1
sufficiently,	1
neither	1
had	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
30:4	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation.	1
	1
30:5	1
So	1
they	1
established	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
make	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
Israel,	1
from	1
Beersheba	1
even	1
to	1
Dan,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
it	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
such	1
sort	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
30:6	1
So	1
the	1
posts	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
throughout	1
all	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
turn	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Israel,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
you,	1
that	1
are	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
	1
30:7	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
like	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
like	1
your	1
brethren,	1
which	1
trespassed	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
who	1
therefore	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
desolation,	1
as	1
ye	1
see.	1
	1
30:8	1
Now	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
stiffnecked,	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
were,	1
but	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
sanctuary,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
sanctified	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
may	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
30:9	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
turn	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
your	1
brethren	1
and	1
your	1
children	1
shall	1
find	1
compassion	1
before	1
them	1
that	1
lead	1
them	1
captive,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
again	1
into	1
this	1
land:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
return	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
30:10	1
So	1
the	1
posts	1
passed	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city	1
through	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
even	1
unto	1
Zebulun:	1
but	1
they	1
laughed	1
them	1
to	1
scorn,	1
and	1
mocked	1
them.	1
	1
30:11	1
Nevertheless	1
divers	1
of	1
Asher	1
and	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
of	1
Zebulun	1
humbled	1
themselves,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
30:12	1
Also	1
in	1
Judah	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
one	1
heart	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princes,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:13	1
And	1
there	1
assembled	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
much	1
people	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
congregation.	1
	1
30:14	1
And	1
they	1
arose	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
altars	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
altars	1
for	1
incense	1
took	1
they	1
away,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
brook	1
Kidron.	1
	1
30:15	1
Then	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
sanctified	1
themselves,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:16	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
their	1
place	1
after	1
their	1
manner,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
priests	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood,	1
which	1
they	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
30:17	1
For	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
sanctified:	1
therefore	1
the	1
Levites	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
killing	1
of	1
the	1
passovers	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
clean,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:18	1
For	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
many	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
Issachar,	1
and	1
Zebulun,	1
had	1
not	1
cleansed	1
themselves,	1
yet	1
did	1
they	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
otherwise	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
written.	1
But	1
Hezekiah	1
prayed	1
for	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
good	1
LORD	1
pardon	1
every	1
one	1
30:19	1
That	1
prepareth	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
seek	1
God,	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
cleansed	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
purification	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
30:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened	1
to	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
healed	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
30:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
kept	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
seven	1
days	1
with	1
great	1
gladness:	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
singing	1
with	1
loud	1
instruments	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
30:22	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
spake	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
taught	1
the	1
good	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
throughout	1
the	1
feast	1
seven	1
days,	1
offering	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
and	1
making	1
confession	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
30:23	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
assembly	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
keep	1
other	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
they	1
kept	1
other	1
seven	1
days	1
with	1
gladness.	1
	1
30:24	1
For	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
did	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
congregation	1
a	1
thousand	1
bullocks	1
and	1
seven	1
thousand	1
sheep;	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
congregation	1
a	1
thousand	1
bullocks	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
sheep:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
priests	1
sanctified	1
themselves.	1
	1
30:25	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
Judah,	1
with	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
strangers	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Judah,	1
rejoiced.	1
	1
30:26	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
like	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
30:27	1
Then	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
Levites	1
arose	1
and	1
blessed	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
their	1
voice	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
their	1
prayer	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
holy	1
dwelling	1
place,	1
even	1
unto	1
heaven.	1
	1
31:1	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
finished,	1
all	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
images	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
the	1
altars	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
in	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
and	1
Manasseh,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
utterly	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
returned,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
possession,	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
cities.	1
	1
31:2	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
appointed	1
the	1
courses	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
after	1
their	1
courses,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
service,	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
for	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
for	1
peace	1
offerings,	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
thanks,	1
and	1
to	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:3	1
He	1
appointed	1
also	1
the	1
king's	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
substance	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
to	1
wit,	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
evening	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
and	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
for	1
the	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
set	1
feasts,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:4	1
Moreover	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
encouraged	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
31:5	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
commandment	1
came	1
abroad,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
brought	1
in	1
abundance	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
corn,	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
honey,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
brought	1
they	1
in	1
abundantly.	1
	1
31:6	1
And	1
concerning	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah,	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
they	1
also	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
oxen	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
holy	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
consecrated	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
by	1
heaps.	1
	1
31:7	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
month	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
heaps,	1
and	1
finished	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
31:8	1
And	1
when	1
Hezekiah	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
came	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
heaps,	1
they	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
31:9	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
questioned	1
with	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
concerning	1
the	1
heaps.	1
	1
31:10	1
And	1
Azariah	1
the	1
chief	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Zadok	1
answered	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Since	1
the	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
offerings	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
have	1
left	1
plenty:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
blessed	1
his	1
people;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
left	1
is	1
this	1
great	1
store.	1
	1
31:11	1
Then	1
Hezekiah	1
commanded	1
to	1
prepare	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
prepared	1
them,	1
31:12	1
And	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
offerings	1
and	1
the	1
tithes	1
and	1
the	1
dedicated	1
things	1
faithfully:	1
over	1
which	1
Cononiah	1
the	1
Levite	1
was	1
ruler,	1
and	1
Shimei	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
the	1
next.	1
	1
31:13	1
And	1
Jehiel,	1
and	1
Azaziah,	1
and	1
Nahath,	1
and	1
Asahel,	1
and	1
Jerimoth,	1
and	1
Jozabad,	1
and	1
Eliel,	1
and	1
Ismachiah,	1
and	1
Mahath,	1
and	1
Benaiah,	1
were	1
overseers	1
under	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Cononiah	1
and	1
Shimei	1
his	1
brother,	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
Azariah	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
31:14	1
And	1
Kore	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imnah	1
the	1
Levite,	1
the	1
porter	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
was	1
over	1
the	1
freewill	1
offerings	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
distribute	1
the	1
oblations	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
things.	1
	1
31:15	1
And	1
next	1
him	1
were	1
Eden,	1
and	1
Miniamin,	1
and	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
Shemaiah,	1
Amariah,	1
and	1
Shecaniah,	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
in	1
their	1
set	1
office,	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
their	1
brethren	1
by	1
courses,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
small:	1
31:16	1
Beside	1
their	1
genealogy	1
of	1
males,	1
from	1
three	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward,	1
even	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
his	1
daily	1
portion	1
for	1
their	1
service	1
in	1
their	1
charges	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
courses;	1
31:17	1
Both	1
to	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
by	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward,	1
in	1
their	1
charges	1
by	1
their	1
courses;	1
31:18	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
little	1
ones,	1
their	1
wives,	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
and	1
their	1
daughters,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
congregation:	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
set	1
office	1
they	1
sanctified	1
themselves	1
in	1
holiness:	1
31:19	1
Also	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
suburbs	1
of	1
their	1
cities,	1
in	1
every	1
several	1
city,	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
expressed	1
by	1
name,	1
to	1
give	1
portions	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
males	1
among	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
reckoned	1
by	1
genealogies	1
among	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
31:20	1
And	1
thus	1
did	1
Hezekiah	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judah,	1
and	1
wrought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
right	1
and	1
truth	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
31:21	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
work	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
commandments,	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
God,	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
prospered.	1
	1
32:1	1
After	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
establishment	1
thereof,	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
came,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Judah,	1
and	1
encamped	1
against	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
win	1
them	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
32:2	1
And	1
when	1
Hezekiah	1
saw	1
that	1
Sennacherib	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
purposed	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
32:3	1
He	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
his	1
princes	1
and	1
his	1
mighty	1
men	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
fountains	1
which	1
were	1
without	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
32:4	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
gathered	1
much	1
people	1
together,	1
who	1
stopped	1
all	1
the	1
fountains,	1
and	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
should	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
come,	1
and	1
find	1
much	1
water?	1
32:5	1
Also	1
he	1
strengthened	1
himself,	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
wall	1
that	1
was	1
broken,	1
and	1
raised	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
towers,	1
and	1
another	1
wall	1
without,	1
and	1
repaired	1
Millo	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
made	1
darts	1
and	1
shields	1
in	1
abundance.	1
	1
32:6	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
captains	1
of	1
war	1
over	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
spake	1
comfortably	1
to	1
them,	1
saying,	1
32:7	1
Be	1
strong	1
and	1
courageous,	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
nor	1
dismayed	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
nor	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
is	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
there	1
be	1
more	1
with	1
us	1
than	1
with	1
him:	1
32:8	1
With	1
him	1
is	1
an	1
arm	1
of	1
flesh;	1
but	1
with	1
us	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
help	1
us,	1
and	1
to	1
fight	1
our	1
battles.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
rested	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
32:9	1
After	1
this	1
did	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
send	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
(but	1
he	1
himself	1
laid	1
siege	1
against	1
Lachish,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
power	1
with	1
him,)	1
unto	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
Judah	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
32:10	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Sennacherib	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
Whereon	1
do	1
ye	1
trust,	1
that	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
in	1
Jerusalem?	1
32:11	1
Doth	1
not	1
Hezekiah	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
yourselves	1
to	1
die	1
by	1
famine	1
and	1
by	1
thirst,	1
saying,	1
The	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria?	1
	1
32:12	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
Hezekiah	1
taken	1
away	1
his	1
high	1
places	1
and	1
his	1
altars,	1
and	1
commanded	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
worship	1
before	1
one	1
altar,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
it?	1
	1
32:13	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
fathers	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
other	1
lands?	1
were	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
those	1
lands	1
any	1
ways	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
their	1
lands	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
32:14	1
Who	1
was	1
there	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
those	1
nations	1
that	1
my	1
fathers	1
utterly	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
his	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
that	1
your	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
32:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
not	1
Hezekiah	1
deceive	1
you,	1
nor	1
persuade	1
you	1
on	1
this	1
manner,	1
neither	1
yet	1
believe	1
him:	1
for	1
no	1
god	1
of	1
any	1
nation	1
or	1
kingdom	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
his	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
fathers:	1
how	1
much	1
less	1
shall	1
your	1
God	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand?	1
	1
32:16	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
spake	1
yet	1
more	1
against	1
the	1
LORD	1
God,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
servant	1
Hezekiah.	1
	1
32:17	1
He	1
wrote	1
also	1
letters	1
to	1
rail	1
on	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
against	1
him,	1
saying,	1
As	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
other	1
lands	1
have	1
not	1
delivered	1
their	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand,	1
so	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Hezekiah	1
deliver	1
his	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
32:18	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
speech	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
to	1
affright	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
trouble	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
32:19	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
as	1
against	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
32:20	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
Hezekiah	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
prayed	1
and	1
cried	1
to	1
heaven.	1
	1
32:21	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
an	1
angel,	1
which	1
cut	1
off	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour,	1
and	1
the	1
leaders	1
and	1
captains	1
in	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria.	1
So	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
shame	1
of	1
face	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god,	1
they	1
that	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
bowels	1
slew	1
him	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
32:22	1
Thus	1
the	1
LORD	1
saved	1
Hezekiah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Sennacherib	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
other,	1
and	1
guided	1
them	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
32:23	1
And	1
many	1
brought	1
gifts	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
presents	1
to	1
Hezekiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah:	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
magnified	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
from	1
thenceforth.	1
	1
32:24	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
Hezekiah	1
was	1
sick	1
to	1
the	1
death,	1
and	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sign.	1
	1
32:25	1
But	1
Hezekiah	1
rendered	1
not	1
again	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
benefit	1
done	1
unto	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up:	1
therefore	1
there	1
was	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
upon	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
32:26	1
Notwithstanding	1
Hezekiah	1
humbled	1
himself	1
for	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
not	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Hezekiah.	1
	1
32:27	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
had	1
exceeding	1
much	1
riches	1
and	1
honour:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
treasuries	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
gold,	1
and	1
for	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
for	1
spices,	1
and	1
for	1
shields,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
pleasant	1
jewels;	1
32:28	1
Storehouses	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil;	1
and	1
stalls	1
for	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
cotes	1
for	1
flocks.	1
	1
32:29	1
Moreover	1
he	1
provided	1
him	1
cities,	1
and	1
possessions	1
of	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds	1
in	1
abundance:	1
for	1
God	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
substance	1
very	1
much.	1
	1
32:30	1
This	1
same	1
Hezekiah	1
also	1
stopped	1
the	1
upper	1
watercourse	1
of	1
Gihon,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
straight	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David.	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
prospered	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
32:31	1
Howbeit	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
ambassadors	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
who	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
wonder	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
God	1
left	1
him,	1
to	1
try	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
32:32	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Hezekiah,	1
and	1
his	1
goodness,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
Isaiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amoz,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
32:33	1
And	1
Hezekiah	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
chiefest	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
David:	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
did	1
him	1
honour	1
at	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
Manasseh	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
33:1	1
Manasseh	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
fifty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
33:2	1
But	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
cast	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:3	1
For	1
he	1
built	1
again	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
which	1
Hezekiah	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
broken	1
down,	1
and	1
he	1
reared	1
up	1
altars	1
for	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
made	1
groves,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
served	1
them.	1
	1
33:4	1
Also	1
he	1
built	1
altars	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whereof	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
said,	1
In	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
my	1
name	1
be	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
33:5	1
And	1
he	1
built	1
altars	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
33:6	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
his	1
children	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hinnom:	1
also	1
he	1
observed	1
times,	1
and	1
used	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
used	1
witchcraft,	1
and	1
dealt	1
with	1
a	1
familiar	1
spirit,	1
and	1
with	1
wizards:	1
he	1
wrought	1
much	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
anger.	1
	1
33:7	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
a	1
carved	1
image,	1
the	1
idol	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made,	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
of	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
David	1
and	1
to	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son,	1
In	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
will	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
name	1
for	1
ever:	1
33:8	1
Neither	1
will	1
I	1
any	1
more	1
remove	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
Israel	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
appointed	1
for	1
your	1
fathers;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
them,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
the	1
ordinances	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
33:9	1
So	1
Manasseh	1
made	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
heathen,	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
destroyed	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
to	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
people:	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hearken.	1
	1
33:11	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria,	1
which	1
took	1
Manasseh	1
among	1
the	1
thorns,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
fetters,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
33:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
affliction,	1
he	1
besought	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
humbled	1
himself	1
greatly	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
33:13	1
And	1
prayed	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
supplication,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
Then	1
Manasseh	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
he	1
was	1
God.	1
	1
33:14	1
Now	1
after	1
this	1
he	1
built	1
a	1
wall	1
without	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
of	1
Gihon,	1
in	1
the	1
valley,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
fish	1
gate,	1
and	1
compassed	1
about	1
Ophel,	1
and	1
raised	1
it	1
up	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
height,	1
and	1
put	1
captains	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
33:15	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
strange	1
gods,	1
and	1
the	1
idol	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
altars	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
built	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
33:16	1
And	1
he	1
repaired	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
thereon	1
peace	1
offerings	1
and	1
thank	1
offerings,	1
and	1
commanded	1
Judah	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:17	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
sacrifice	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
yet	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
only.	1
	1
33:18	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
his	1
prayer	1
unto	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
seers	1
that	1
spake	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
33:19	1
His	1
prayer	1
also,	1
and	1
how	1
God	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
sins,	1
and	1
his	1
trespass,	1
and	1
the	1
places	1
wherein	1
he	1
built	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
groves	1
and	1
graven	1
images,	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
humbled:	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
among	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
seers.	1
	1
33:20	1
So	1
Manasseh	1
slept	1
with	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
they	1
buried	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house:	1
and	1
Amon	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
33:21	1
Amon	1
was	1
two	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
two	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
33:22	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
did	1
Manasseh	1
his	1
father:	1
for	1
Amon	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
carved	1
images	1
which	1
Manasseh	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
served	1
them;	1
33:23	1
And	1
humbled	1
not	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
Manasseh	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
humbled	1
himself;	1
but	1
Amon	1
trespassed	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
33:24	1
And	1
his	1
servants	1
conspired	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
slew	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
33:25	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
slew	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
conspired	1
against	1
king	1
Amon;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
made	1
Josiah	1
his	1
son	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
34:1	1
Josiah	1
was	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
one	1
and	1
thirty	1
years.	1
	1
34:2	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
declined	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
34:3	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
young,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
seek	1
after	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
David	1
his	1
father:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
purge	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
places,	1
and	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
the	1
carved	1
images,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
images.	1
	1
34:4	1
And	1
they	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
altars	1
of	1
Baalim	1
in	1
his	1
presence;	1
and	1
the	1
images,	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
high	1
above	1
them,	1
he	1
cut	1
down;	1
and	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
the	1
carved	1
images,	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
images,	1
he	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
made	1
dust	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
strowed	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
graves	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
34:5	1
And	1
he	1
burnt	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
upon	1
their	1
altars,	1
and	1
cleansed	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
34:6	1
And	1
so	1
did	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Manasseh,	1
and	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Simeon,	1
even	1
unto	1
Naphtali,	1
with	1
their	1
mattocks	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
34:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
altars	1
and	1
the	1
groves,	1
and	1
had	1
beaten	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
into	1
powder,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
34:8	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
purged	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
sent	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azaliah,	1
and	1
Maaseiah	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
Joah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joahaz	1
the	1
recorder,	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
34:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
doors	1
had	1
gathered	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Manasseh	1
and	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin;	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
34:10	1
And	1
they	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
workmen	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
workmen	1
that	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
repair	1
and	1
amend	1
the	1
house:	1
34:11	1
Even	1
to	1
the	1
artificers	1
and	1
builders	1
gave	1
they	1
it,	1
to	1
buy	1
hewn	1
stone,	1
and	1
timber	1
for	1
couplings,	1
and	1
to	1
floor	1
the	1
houses	1
which	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah	1
had	1
destroyed.	1
	1
34:12	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
did	1
the	1
work	1
faithfully:	1
and	1
the	1
overseers	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
Jahath	1
and	1
Obadiah,	1
the	1
Levites,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari;	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
and	1
Meshullam,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Kohathites,	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
forward;	1
and	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
skill	1
of	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick.	1
	1
34:13	1
Also	1
they	1
were	1
over	1
the	1
bearers	1
of	1
burdens,	1
and	1
were	1
overseers	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
wrought	1
the	1
work	1
in	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
service:	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
there	1
were	1
scribes,	1
and	1
officers,	1
and	1
porters.	1
	1
34:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest	1
found	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
given	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
34:15	1
And	1
Hilkiah	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
Hilkiah	1
delivered	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
Shaphan.	1
	1
34:16	1
And	1
Shaphan	1
carried	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
king	1
word	1
back	1
again,	1
saying,	1
All	1
that	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
thy	1
servants,	1
they	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
34:17	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
money	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
delivered	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
overseers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
workmen.	1
	1
34:18	1
Then	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe	1
told	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
Hilkiah	1
the	1
priest	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
book.	1
And	1
Shaphan	1
read	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
34:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
he	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
34:20	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
Hilkiah,	1
and	1
Ahikam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shaphan,	1
and	1
Abdon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Micah,	1
and	1
Shaphan	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
Asaiah	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
king's,	1
saying,	1
34:21	1
Go,	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
Israel	1
and	1
in	1
Judah,	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
that	1
is	1
found:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
us,	1
because	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
do	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
34:22	1
And	1
Hilkiah,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
appointed,	1
went	1
to	1
Huldah	1
the	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Shallum	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tikvath,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hasrah,	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
wardrobe;	1
(now	1
she	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
college:)	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
that	1
effect.	1
	1
34:23	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Tell	1
ye	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
me,	1
34:24	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
evil	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
curses	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
read	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah:	1
34:25	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
burned	1
incense	1
unto	1
other	1
gods,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
provoke	1
me	1
to	1
anger	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
therefore	1
my	1
wrath	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
quenched.	1
	1
34:26	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
who	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
enquire	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
concerning	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard;	1
34:27	1
Because	1
thine	1
heart	1
was	1
tender,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
humble	1
thyself	1
before	1
God,	1
when	1
thou	1
heardest	1
his	1
words	1
against	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof,	1
and	1
humbledst	1
thyself	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
didst	1
rend	1
thy	1
clothes,	1
and	1
weep	1
before	1
me;	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
thee	1
also,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:28	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
thee	1
to	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
gathered	1
to	1
thy	1
grave	1
in	1
peace,	1
neither	1
shall	1
thine	1
eyes	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
upon	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
same.	1
So	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
king	1
word	1
again.	1
	1
34:29	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
34:30	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
great	1
and	1
small:	1
and	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
their	1
ears	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
34:31	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
stood	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
covenant	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
his	1
testimonies,	1
and	1
his	1
statutes,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
soul,	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
34:32	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
to	1
stand	1
to	1
it.	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
34:33	1
And	1
Josiah	1
took	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
countries	1
that	1
pertained	1
to	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
in	1
Israel	1
to	1
serve,	1
even	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
days	1
they	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
following	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
35:1	1
Moreover	1
Josiah	1
kept	1
a	1
passover	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover	1
on	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
35:2	1
And	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
their	1
charges,	1
and	1
encouraged	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
35:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
taught	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
were	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Put	1
the	1
holy	1
ark	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
which	1
Solomon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
build;	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
upon	1
your	1
shoulders:	1
serve	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
people	1
Israel,	1
35:4	1
And	1
prepare	1
yourselves	1
by	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
after	1
your	1
courses,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
35:5	1
And	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
your	1
brethren	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
35:6	1
So	1
kill	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
sanctify	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
prepare	1
your	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
35:7	1
And	1
Josiah	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
lambs	1
and	1
kids,	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
passover	1
offerings,	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
present,	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thirty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
bullocks:	1
these	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
substance.	1
	1
35:8	1
And	1
his	1
princes	1
gave	1
willingly	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Levites:	1
Hilkiah	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
and	1
Jehiel,	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
for	1
the	1
passover	1
offerings	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
small	1
cattle	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
oxen.	1
	1
35:9	1
Conaniah	1
also,	1
and	1
Shemaiah	1
and	1
Nethaneel,	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
Hashabiah	1
and	1
Jeiel	1
and	1
Jozabad,	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites	1
for	1
passover	1
offerings	1
five	1
thousand	1
small	1
cattle,	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
oxen.	1
	1
35:10	1
So	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
prepared,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
stood	1
in	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
their	1
courses,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
	1
35:11	1
And	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
flayed	1
them.	1
	1
35:12	1
And	1
they	1
removed	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
divisions	1
of	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses.	1
And	1
so	1
did	1
they	1
with	1
the	1
oxen.	1
	1
35:13	1
And	1
they	1
roasted	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
fire	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
ordinance:	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
holy	1
offerings	1
sod	1
they	1
in	1
pots,	1
and	1
in	1
caldrons,	1
and	1
in	1
pans,	1
and	1
divided	1
them	1
speedily	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
35:14	1
And	1
afterward	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
priests:	1
because	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron	1
were	1
busied	1
in	1
offering	1
of	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
until	1
night;	1
therefore	1
the	1
Levites	1
prepared	1
for	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Aaron.	1
	1
35:15	1
And	1
the	1
singers	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Asaph	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
place,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
Asaph,	1
and	1
Heman,	1
and	1
Jeduthun	1
the	1
king's	1
seer;	1
and	1
the	1
porters	1
waited	1
at	1
every	1
gate;	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
their	1
service;	1
for	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites	1
prepared	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
35:16	1
So	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
prepared	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
king	1
Josiah.	1
	1
35:17	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
kept	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
35:18	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
passover	1
like	1
to	1
that	1
kept	1
in	1
Israel	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet;	1
neither	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
keep	1
such	1
a	1
passover	1
as	1
Josiah	1
kept,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel	1
that	1
were	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
35:19	1
In	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Josiah	1
was	1
this	1
passover	1
kept.	1
	1
35:20	1
After	1
all	1
this,	1
when	1
Josiah	1
had	1
prepared	1
the	1
temple,	1
Necho	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Charchemish	1
by	1
Euphrates:	1
and	1
Josiah	1
went	1
out	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
35:21	1
But	1
he	1
sent	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
king	1
of	1
Judah?	1
I	1
come	1
not	1
against	1
thee	1
this	1
day,	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
wherewith	1
I	1
have	1
war:	1
for	1
God	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
haste:	1
forbear	1
thee	1
from	1
meddling	1
with	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
he	1
destroy	1
thee	1
not.	1
	1
35:22	1
Nevertheless	1
Josiah	1
would	1
not	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
him,	1
but	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fight	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Necho	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Megiddo.	1
	1
35:23	1
And	1
the	1
archers	1
shot	1
at	1
king	1
Josiah;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
Have	1
me	1
away;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sore	1
wounded.	1
	1
35:24	1
His	1
servants	1
therefore	1
took	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
chariot,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
that	1
he	1
had;	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
he	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
his	1
fathers.	1
And	1
all	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
mourned	1
for	1
Josiah.	1
	1
35:25	1
And	1
Jeremiah	1
lamented	1
for	1
Josiah:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
singing	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
singing	1
women	1
spake	1
of	1
Josiah	1
in	1
their	1
lamentations	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
an	1
ordinance	1
in	1
Israel:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
lamentations.	1
	1
35:26	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Josiah,	1
and	1
his	1
goodness,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
35:27	1
And	1
his	1
deeds,	1
first	1
and	1
last,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah.	1
	1
36:1	1
Then	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
took	1
Jehoahaz	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josiah,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
stead	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:2	1
Jehoahaz	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
put	1
him	1
down	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
condemned	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
36:4	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt	1
made	1
Eliakim	1
his	1
brother	1
king	1
over	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
Jehoiakim.	1
And	1
Necho	1
took	1
Jehoahaz	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
36:5	1
Jehoiakim	1
was	1
twenty	1
and	1
five	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
eleven	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
36:6	1
Against	1
him	1
came	1
up	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
fetters,	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
36:7	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
also	1
carried	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
at	1
Babylon.	1
	1
36:8	1
Now	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
Jehoiakim,	1
and	1
his	1
abominations	1
which	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
behold,	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
Judah:	1
and	1
Jehoiachin	1
his	1
son	1
reigned	1
in	1
his	1
stead.	1
	1
36:9	1
Jehoiachin	1
was	1
eight	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
he	1
reigned	1
three	1
months	1
and	1
ten	1
days	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
36:10	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
year	1
was	1
expired,	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
sent,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Babylon,	1
with	1
the	1
goodly	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
Zedekiah	1
his	1
brother	1
king	1
over	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:11	1
Zedekiah	1
was	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
reign,	1
and	1
reigned	1
eleven	1
years	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:12	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
humbled	1
not	1
himself	1
before	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet	1
speaking	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
36:13	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
rebelled	1
against	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
swear	1
by	1
God:	1
but	1
he	1
stiffened	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
hardened	1
his	1
heart	1
from	1
turning	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
36:14	1
Moreover	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
transgressed	1
very	1
much	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
abominations	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
polluted	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hallowed	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
36:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
their	1
fathers	1
sent	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
his	1
messengers,	1
rising	1
up	1
betimes,	1
and	1
sending;	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
dwelling	1
place:	1
36:16	1
But	1
they	1
mocked	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
despised	1
his	1
words,	1
and	1
misused	1
his	1
prophets,	1
until	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
arose	1
against	1
his	1
people,	1
till	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
remedy.	1
	1
36:17	1
Therefore	1
he	1
brought	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
who	1
slew	1
their	1
young	1
men	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
compassion	1
upon	1
young	1
man	1
or	1
maiden,	1
old	1
man,	1
or	1
him	1
that	1
stooped	1
for	1
age:	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
36:18	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
princes;	1
all	1
these	1
he	1
brought	1
to	1
Babylon.	1
	1
36:19	1
And	1
they	1
burnt	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
brake	1
down	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
burnt	1
all	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
all	1
the	1
goodly	1
vessels	1
thereof.	1
	1
36:20	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
sword	1
carried	1
he	1
away	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
servants	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
sons	1
until	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Persia:	1
36:21	1
To	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah,	1
until	1
the	1
land	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
her	1
sabbaths:	1
for	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
desolate	1
she	1
kept	1
sabbath,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
years.	1
	1
36:22	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Jeremiah	1
might	1
be	1
accomplished,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
all	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
also	1
in	1
writing,	1
saying,	1
36:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
All	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
given	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
charged	1
me	1
to	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Judah.	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
people?	1
	1
The	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
up.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Ezra	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1

of	1
Jeremiah	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1

that	1

throughout	1
all	1
his	1

and	1
put	1
it	1
also	1
in	1
writing,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
charged	1
me	1
to	1
build	1
him	1
an	1
house	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:3	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
among	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
people?	1
his	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
(he	1
is	1
the	1
God,)	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
whosoever	1
remaineth	1
in	1
any	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
sojourneth,	1
let	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
place	1
help	1
him	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
with	1
goods,	1
and	1
with	1
beasts,	1
beside	1
the	1
freewill	1
offering	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:5	1
Then	1
rose	1
up	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
whose	1
spirit	1
God	1
had	1
raised,	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
them	1
strengthened	1
their	1
hands	1
with	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver,	1
with	1

and	1
there	1
were	1

two	1

some	1

when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
offered	1
freely	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
place:	1
2:69	1
They	1
gave	1
after	1
their	1
ability	1
unto	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
threescore	1
and	1
one	1

five	1
thousand	1
pound	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
one	1
hundred	1

garments.	1
	1
2:70	1
So	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1

and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
the	1

dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
cities,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
in	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seventh	1
month	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cities,	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:2	1
Then	1
stood	1
up	1
Jeshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jozadak,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
builded	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
thereon,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
altar	1
upon	1
his	1
bases;	1
for	1
fear	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
those	1
countries:	1
and	1
they	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
thereon	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
morning	1
and	1
evening.	1
	1
3:4	1
They	1
kept	1
also	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
and	1
offered	1
the	1
daily	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
by	1
number,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
custom,	1
as	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
required;	1
3:5	1
And	1
afterward	1
offered	1
the	1
continual	1
burnt	1
offering,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
set	1
feasts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
were	1
consecrated,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
willingly	1
offered	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:6	1
From	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month	1
began	1
they	1
to	1
offer	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
But	1

of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
laid.	1
	1
3:7	1
They	1
gave	1
money	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
masons,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
carpenters;	1
and	1
meat,	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
oil,	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
Tyre,	1
to	1
bring	1
cedar	1
trees	1
from	1
Lebanon	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Joppa,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grant	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
their	1
coming	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
month,	1
began	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
Jeshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jozadak,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
appointed	1
the	1
Levites,	1
from	1
twenty	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
upward,	1
to	1
set	1
forward	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:9	1
Then	1
stood	1
Jeshua	1
with	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
Kadmiel	1
and	1
his	1
sons,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Judah,	1
together,	1
to	1
set	1
forward	1
the	1
workmen	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Henadad,	1
with	1
their	1
sons	1
and	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
builders	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
their	1
apparel	1
with	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Asaph	1
with	1
cymbals,	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
LORD,	1
after	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
David	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
they	1
sang	1
together	1
by	1
course	1
in	1
praising	1
and	1
giving	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
good,	1
for	1
his	1
mercy	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever	1
toward	1
Israel.	1
	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
shout,	1
when	1
they	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
3:12	1
But	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
who	1
were	1
ancient	1
men,	1
that	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
first	1
house,	1
when	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
was	1
laid	1
before	1
their	1
eyes,	1
wept	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice;	1
and	1
many	1
shouted	1
aloud	1
for	1
joy:	1
3:13	1
So	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
could	1
not	1
discern	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
shout	1
of	1
joy	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
weeping	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
shouted	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
shout,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
was	1
heard	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
builded	1
the	1
temple	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
4:2	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Zerubbabel,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
build	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
seek	1
your	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
do;	1
and	1
we	1
do	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
him	1
since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Esarhaddon	1
king	1
of	1
Assur,	1
which	1
brought	1
us	1
up	1
hither.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
Zerubbabel,	1
and	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Israel,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
us	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
house	1
unto	1
our	1
God;	1
but	1
we	1
ourselves	1
together	1
will	1
build	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
as	1
king	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Persia	1
hath	1
commanded	1
us.	1
	1
4:4	1
Then	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
weakened	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
troubled	1
them	1
in	1
building,	1
4:5	1
And	1
hired	1
counsellors	1
against	1
them,	1
to	1
frustrate	1
their	1
purpose,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius	1
king	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
wrote	1
they	1
unto	1
him	1
an	1
accusation	1
against	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
wrote	1
Bishlam,	1
Mithredath,	1
Tabeel,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
companions,	1
unto	1
Artaxerxes	1
king	1
of	1
Persia;	1
and	1
the	1
writing	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
Syrian	1
tongue,	1
and	1
interpreted	1
in	1
the	1
Syrian	1
tongue.	1
	1
4:8	1
Rehum	1
the	1
chancellor	1
and	1
Shimshai	1
the	1
scribe	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
this	1
sort:	1
4:9	1
Then	1
wrote	1
Rehum	1
the	1
chancellor,	1
and	1
Shimshai	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
companions;	1
the	1
Dinaites,	1
the	1
Apharsathchites,	1
the	1
Tarpelites,	1
the	1
Apharsites,	1
the	1
Archevites,	1
the	1
Babylonians,	1
the	1
Susanchites,	1
the	1
Dehavites,	1
and	1
the	1
Elamites,	1
4:10	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
noble	1
Asnapper	1
brought	1
over,	1
and	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
4:11	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
even	1
unto	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king;	1
Thy	1
servants	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
4:12	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
thee	1
to	1
us	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
building	1
the	1
rebellious	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
city,	1
and	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof,	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
foundations.	1
	1
4:13	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
that,	1
if	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
builded,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
set	1
up	1
again,	1
then	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
pay	1
toll,	1
tribute,	1
and	1
custom,	1
and	1
so	1
thou	1
shalt	1
endamage	1
the	1
revenue	1
of	1
the	1
kings.	1
	1
4:14	1
Now	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
maintenance	1
from	1
the	1
king's	1
palace,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
meet	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
king's	1
dishonour,	1
therefore	1
have	1
we	1
sent	1
and	1
certified	1
the	1
king;	1
4:15	1
That	1
search	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
records	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers:	1
so	1
shalt	1
thou	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
records,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
city	1
is	1
a	1
rebellious	1
city,	1
and	1
hurtful	1
unto	1
kings	1
and	1
provinces,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
moved	1
sedition	1
within	1
the	1
same	1
of	1
old	1
time:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
was	1
this	1
city	1
destroyed.	1
	1
4:16	1
We	1
certify	1
the	1
king	1
that,	1
if	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
builded	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
walls	1
thereof	1
set	1
up,	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
portion	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
4:17	1
Then	1
sent	1
the	1
king	1
an	1
answer	1
unto	1
Rehum	1
the	1
chancellor,	1
and	1
to	1
Shimshai	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
companions	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
rest	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
Peace,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
4:18	1
The	1
letter	1
which	1
ye	1
sent	1
unto	1
us	1
hath	1
been	1
plainly	1
read	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
I	1
commanded,	1
and	1
search	1
hath	1
been	1
made,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
city	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
hath	1
made	1
insurrection	1
against	1
kings,	1
and	1
that	1
rebellion	1
and	1
sedition	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
therein.	1
	1
4:20	1
There	1
have	1
been	1
mighty	1
kings	1
also	1
over	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
have	1
ruled	1
over	1
all	1
countries	1
beyond	1
the	1
river;	1
and	1
toll,	1
tribute,	1
and	1
custom,	1
was	1
paid	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:21	1
Give	1
ye	1
now	1
commandment	1
to	1
cause	1
these	1
men	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
city	1
be	1
not	1
builded,	1
until	1
another	1
commandment	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
4:22	1
Take	1
heed	1
now	1
that	1
ye	1
fail	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
this:	1
why	1
should	1
damage	1
grow	1
to	1
the	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
kings?	1
	1
4:23	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
king	1
Artaxerxes'	1
letter	1
was	1
read	1
before	1
Rehum,	1
and	1
Shimshai	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
their	1
companions,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
to	1
cease	1
by	1
force	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
4:24	1
Then	1
ceased	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
So	1
it	1
ceased	1
unto	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius	1
king	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo,	1
prophesied	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:2	1
Then	1
rose	1
up	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
Jeshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jozadak,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
prophets	1
of	1
God	1
helping	1
them.	1
	1
5:3	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
Tatnai,	1
governor	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
Shetharboznai	1
and	1
their	1
companions,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Who	1
hath	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
build	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
this	1
wall?	1
	1
5:4	1
Then	1
said	1
we	1
unto	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
make	1
this	1
building?	1
	1
5:5	1
But	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
cease,	1
till	1
the	1
matter	1
came	1
to	1
Darius:	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
returned	1
answer	1
by	1
letter	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
5:6	1
The	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
Tatnai,	1
governor	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
Shetharboznai	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
the	1
Apharsachites,	1
which	1
were	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
sent	1
unto	1
Darius	1
the	1
king:	1
5:7	1
They	1
sent	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
him,	1
wherein	1
was	1
written	1
thus;	1
Unto	1
Darius	1
the	1
king,	1
all	1
peace.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Judea,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
builded	1
with	1
great	1
stones,	1
and	1
timber	1
is	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
this	1
work	1
goeth	1
fast	1
on,	1
and	1
prospereth	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
asked	1
we	1
those	1
elders,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
thus,	1
Who	1
commanded	1
you	1
to	1
build	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
these	1
walls?	1
	1
5:10	1
We	1
asked	1
their	1
names	1
also,	1
to	1
certify	1
thee,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
write	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
thus	1
they	1
returned	1
us	1
answer,	1
saying,	1
We	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
builded	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
ago,	1
which	1
a	1
great	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
builded	1
and	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
5:12	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
our	1
fathers	1
had	1
provoked	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
unto	1
wrath,	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
the	1
Chaldean,	1
who	1
destroyed	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
carried	1
the	1
people	1
away	1
into	1
Babylon.	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
the	1
same	1
king	1
Cyrus	1
made	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
build	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
vessels	1
also	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
those	1
did	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
delivered	1
unto	1
one,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Sheshbazzar,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
governor;	1
5:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
these	1
vessels,	1
go,	1
carry	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
builded	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
5:16	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
same	1
Sheshbazzar,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
even	1
until	1
now	1
hath	1
it	1
been	1
in	1
building,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
finished.	1
	1
5:17	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
if	1
it	1
seem	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
search	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
treasure	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
there	1
at	1
Babylon,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
that	1
a	1
decree	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
build	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
send	1
his	1
pleasure	1
to	1
us	1
concerning	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
6:1	1
Then	1
Darius	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
decree,	1
and	1
search	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
rolls,	1
where	1
the	1
treasures	1
were	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
Babylon.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
at	1
Achmetha,	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
a	1
roll,	1
and	1
therein	1
was	1
a	1
record	1
thus	1
written:	1
6:3	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
same	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
decree	1
concerning	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
Let	1
the	1
house	1
be	1
builded,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
offered	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof	1
be	1
strongly	1
laid;	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
threescore	1
cubits;	1
6:4	1
With	1
three	1
rows	1
of	1
great	1
stones,	1
and	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
new	1
timber:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
expenses	1
be	1
given	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
6:5	1
And	1
also	1
let	1
the	1
golden	1
and	1
silver	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
took	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
brought	1
unto	1
Babylon,	1
be	1
restored,	1
and	1
brought	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:6	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
Tatnai,	1
governor	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
Shetharboznai,	1
and	1
your	1
companions	1
the	1
Apharsachites,	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
be	1
ye	1
far	1
from	1
thence:	1
6:7	1
Let	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
alone;	1
let	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
build	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
place.	1
	1
6:8	1
Moreover	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
to	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
these	1
Jews	1
for	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
goods,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
tribute	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
forthwith	1
expenses	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
these	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
hindered.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
need	1
of,	1
both	1
young	1
bullocks,	1
and	1
rams,	1
and	1
lambs,	1
for	1
the	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
wheat,	1
salt,	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
given	1
them	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
without	1
fail:	1
6:10	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
offer	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
sweet	1
savours	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
sons.	1
	1
6:11	1
Also	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
alter	1
this	1
word,	1
let	1
timber	1
be	1
pulled	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
being	1
set	1
up,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
hanged	1
thereon;	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
house	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill	1
for	1
this.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
hath	1
caused	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
dwell	1
there	1
destroy	1
all	1
kings	1
and	1
people,	1
that	1
shall	1
put	1
to	1
their	1
hand	1
to	1
alter	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
I	1
Darius	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
decree;	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
speed.	1
	1
6:13	1
Then	1
Tatnai,	1
governor	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river,	1
Shetharboznai,	1
and	1
their	1
companions,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
Darius	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
sent,	1
so	1
they	1
did	1
speedily.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
builded,	1
and	1
they	1
prospered	1
through	1
the	1
prophesying	1
of	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet	1
and	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo.	1
And	1
they	1
builded,	1
and	1
finished	1
it,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Cyrus,	1
and	1
Darius,	1
and	1
Artaxerxes	1
king	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
this	1
house	1
was	1
finished	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Adar,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
kept	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
joy.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
offered	1
at	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
an	1
hundred	1
bullocks,	1
two	1
hundred	1
rams,	1
four	1
hundred	1
lambs;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering	1
for	1
all	1
Israel,	1
twelve	1
he	1
goats,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
they	1
set	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
their	1
divisions,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
in	1
their	1
courses,	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
kept	1
the	1
passover	1
upon	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
purified	1
together,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
pure,	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
passover	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
captivity,	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
separated	1
themselves	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
did	1
eat,	1
6:22	1
And	1
kept	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
seven	1
days	1
with	1
joy:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
joyful,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria	1
unto	1
them,	1
to	1
strengthen	1
their	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
after	1
these	1
things,	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
king	1
of	1
Persia,	1
Ezra	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Seraiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hilkiah,	1
7:2	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Shallum,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zadok,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahitub,	1
7:3	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Amariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Azariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Meraioth,	1
7:4	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Zerahiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uzzi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bukki,	1
7:5	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Abishua,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Phinehas,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eleazar,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Aaron	1
the	1
chief	1
priest:	1
7:6	1
This	1
Ezra	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Babylon;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
ready	1
scribe	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel	1
had	1
given:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
granted	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
request,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
up	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
the	1
porters,	1
and	1
the	1
Nethinims,	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
fifth	1
month	1
came	1
he	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
God	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
Ezra	1
had	1
prepared	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
Israel	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments.	1
	1
7:11	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
Artaxerxes	1
gave	1
unto	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest,	1
the	1
scribe,	1
even	1
a	1
scribe	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
statutes	1
to	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:12	1
Artaxerxes,	1
king	1
of	1
kings,	1
unto	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest,	1
a	1
scribe	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
perfect	1
peace,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
7:13	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites,	1
in	1
my	1
realm,	1
which	1
are	1
minded	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
freewill	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
go	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
7:14	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
sent	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
seven	1
counsellors,	1
to	1
enquire	1
concerning	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand;	1
7:15	1
And	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
counsellors	1
have	1
freely	1
offered	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
whose	1
habitation	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
7:16	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
gold	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
find	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
with	1
the	1
freewill	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
offering	1
willingly	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
7:17	1
That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
buy	1
speedily	1
with	1
this	1
money	1
bullocks,	1
rams,	1
lambs,	1
with	1
their	1

offerings	1
and	1
their	1

offerings,	1
and	1
offer	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
shall	1
seem	1
good	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
that	1
do	1
after	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
7:19	1
The	1
vessels	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
given	1
thee	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
those	1
deliver	1
thou	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
more	1
shall	1
be	1
needful	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
occasion	1
to	1
bestow,	1
bestow	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
treasure	1
house.	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king,	1
do	1
make	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
treasurers	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest,	1
the	1
scribe	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
require	1
of	1
you,	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
speedily,	1
7:22	1
Unto	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
hundred	1
baths	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
hundred	1
baths	1
of	1
oil,	1
and	1
salt	1
without	1
prescribing	1
how	1
much.	1
	1
7:23	1
Whatsoever	1
is	1
commanded	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
diligently	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
sons?	1
	1
7:24	1
Also	1
we	1
certify	1
you,	1
that	1
touching	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites,	1
singers,	1
porters,	1
Nethinims,	1
or	1
ministers	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lawful	1
to	1
impose	1
toll,	1
tribute,	1
or	1
custom,	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
thou,	1
Ezra,	1
after	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
hand,	1
set	1
magistrates	1
and	1
judges,	1
which	1
may	1
judge	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
know	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
thy	1
God;	1
and	1
teach	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
judgment	1
be	1
executed	1
speedily	1
upon	1
him,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
unto	1
death,	1
or	1
to	1
banishment,	1
or	1
to	1
confiscation	1
of	1
goods,	1
or	1
to	1
imprisonment.	1
	1
7:27	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
which	1
hath	1
put	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
heart,	1
to	1
beautify	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
7:28	1
And	1
hath	1
extended	1
mercy	1
unto	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
counsellors,	1
and	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
mighty	1
princes.	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
strengthened	1
as	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
gathered	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
Israel	1
chief	1
men	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
8:1	1
These	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
genealogy	1

went	1
up	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
Babylon,	1

And	1

Zabbud,	1
and	1
with	1

males.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
I	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
that	1
runneth	1
to	1
Ahava;	1
and	1
there	1
abode	1
we	1
in	1
tents	1
three	1
days:	1
and	1
I	1
viewed	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
found	1
there	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi.	1
	1
8:16	1
Then	1
sent	1
I	1
for	1
Eliezer,	1
for	1
Ariel,	1
for	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
for	1
Elnathan,	1
and	1
for	1
Jarib,	1
and	1
for	1
Elnathan,	1
and	1
for	1
Nathan,	1
and	1
for	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
for	1
Meshullam,	1
chief	1
men;	1
also	1
for	1
Joiarib,	1
and	1
for	1
Elnathan,	1
men	1
of	1
understanding.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
I	1
sent	1
them	1
with	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Iddo	1
the	1
chief	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
Casiphia,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
say	1
unto	1
Iddo,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
Nethinims,	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
Casiphia,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
unto	1
us	1
ministers	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
good	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
upon	1
us	1
they	1
brought	1
us	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
understanding,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Mahli,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Levi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
Sherebiah,	1
with	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
eighteen;	1
8:19	1
And	1
Hashabiah,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Jeshaiah	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Merari,	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
their	1
sons,	1
twenty;	1
8:20	1
Also	1
of	1
the	1
Nethinims,	1
whom	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
had	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
Nethinims:	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
expressed	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
I	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast	1
there,	1
at	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Ahava,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
afflict	1
ourselves	1
before	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
seek	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
right	1
way	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
little	1
ones,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
substance.	1
	1
8:22	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
require	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
soldiers	1
and	1
horsemen	1
to	1
help	1
us	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
because	1
we	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
for	1
good	1
that	1
seek	1
him;	1
but	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
against	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
forsake	1
him.	1
	1
8:23	1
So	1
we	1
fasted	1
and	1
besought	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
this:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
intreated	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
8:24	1
Then	1
I	1
separated	1
twelve	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
Sherebiah,	1
Hashabiah,	1
and	1
ten	1
of	1
their	1
brethren	1
with	1
them,	1
8:25	1
And	1
weighed	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels,	1
even	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
which	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
counsellors,	1
and	1
his	1
lords,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel	1
there	1
present,	1
had	1
offered:	1
8:26	1
I	1
even	1
weighed	1
unto	1
their	1
hand	1
six	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
talents	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
silver	1
vessels	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents,	1
and	1
of	1
gold	1
an	1
hundred	1
talents;	1
8:27	1
Also	1
twenty	1
basons	1
of	1
gold,	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
drams;	1
and	1
two	1
vessels	1
of	1
fine	1
copper,	1
precious	1
as	1
gold.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
vessels	1
are	1
holy	1
also;	1
and	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
are	1
a	1
freewill	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
8:29	1
Watch	1
ye,	1
and	1
keep	1
them,	1
until	1
ye	1
weigh	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
Israel,	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
in	1
the	1
chambers	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:30	1
So	1
took	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
8:31	1
Then	1
we	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Ahava	1
on	1
the	1
twelfth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
he	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
lay	1
in	1
wait	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
abode	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
8:33	1
Now	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
the	1
vessels	1
weighed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Meremoth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Uriah	1
the	1
priest;	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
Eleazar	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Phinehas;	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
was	1
Jozabad	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
Noadiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Binnui,	1
Levites;	1
8:34	1
By	1
number	1
and	1
by	1
weight	1
of	1
every	1
one:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
weight	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
8:35	1
Also	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
offered	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
unto	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
twelve	1
bullocks	1
for	1
all	1
Israel,	1
ninety	1
and	1
six	1
rams,	1
seventy	1
and	1
seven	1
lambs,	1
twelve	1
he	1
goats	1
for	1
a	1
sin	1
offering:	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
burnt	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:36	1
And	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
king's	1
commissions	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
lieutenants,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
governors	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river:	1
and	1
they	1
furthered	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:1	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done,	1
the	1
princes	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
have	1
not	1
separated	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
lands,	1
doing	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
abominations,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
the	1
Moabites,	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
the	1
Amorites.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
of	1
their	1
daughters	1
for	1
themselves,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sons:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
holy	1
seed	1
have	1
mingled	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
those	1
lands:	1
yea,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
rulers	1
hath	1
been	1
chief	1
in	1
this	1
trespass.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
this	1
thing,	1
I	1
rent	1
my	1
garment	1
and	1
my	1
mantle,	1
and	1
plucked	1
off	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
beard,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
astonied.	1
	1
9:4	1
Then	1
were	1
assembled	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
trembled	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away;	1
and	1
I	1
sat	1
astonied	1
until	1
the	1
evening	1
sacrifice.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
evening	1
sacrifice	1
I	1
arose	1
up	1
from	1
my	1
heaviness;	1
and	1
having	1
rent	1
my	1
garment	1
and	1
my	1
mantle,	1
I	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
knees,	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
9:6	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
and	1
blush	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
my	1
face	1
to	1
thee,	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities	1
are	1
increased	1
over	1
our	1
head,	1
and	1
our	1
trespass	1
is	1
grown	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
9:7	1
Since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
have	1
we	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
trespass	1
unto	1
this	1
day;	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
iniquities	1
have	1
we,	1
our	1
kings,	1
and	1
our	1
priests,	1
been	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
lands,	1
to	1
the	1
sword,	1
to	1
captivity,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
spoil,	1
and	1
to	1
confusion	1
of	1
face,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
space	1
grace	1
hath	1
been	1
shewed	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
leave	1
us	1
a	1
remnant	1
to	1
escape,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
nail	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
place,	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
may	1
lighten	1
our	1
eyes,	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
reviving	1
in	1
our	1
bondage.	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
we	1
were	1
bondmen;	1
yet	1
our	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
forsaken	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
bondage,	1
but	1
hath	1
extended	1
mercy	1
unto	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Persia,	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
reviving,	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
desolations	1
thereof,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
wall	1
in	1
Judah	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
our	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
after	1
this?	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
9:11	1
Which	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded	1
by	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
The	1
land,	1
unto	1
which	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
possess	1
it,	1
is	1
an	1
unclean	1
land	1
with	1
the	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
lands,	1
with	1
their	1
abominations,	1
which	1
have	1
filled	1
it	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
their	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
9:12	1
Now	1
therefore	1
give	1
not	1
your	1
daughters	1
unto	1
their	1
sons,	1
neither	1
take	1
their	1
daughters	1
unto	1
your	1
sons,	1
nor	1
seek	1
their	1
peace	1
or	1
their	1
wealth	1
for	1
ever:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance	1
to	1
your	1
children	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us	1
for	1
our	1
evil	1
deeds,	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
great	1
trespass,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
our	1
God	1
hast	1
punished	1
us	1
less	1
than	1
our	1
iniquities	1
deserve,	1
and	1
hast	1
given	1
us	1
such	1
deliverance	1
as	1
this;	1
9:14	1
Should	1
we	1
again	1
break	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
and	1
join	1
in	1
affinity	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
these	1
abominations?	1
wouldest	1
not	1
thou	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
us	1
till	1
thou	1
hadst	1
consumed	1
us,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
remnant	1
nor	1
escaping?	1
	1
9:15	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
art	1
righteous:	1
for	1
we	1
remain	1
yet	1
escaped,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day:	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
before	1
thee	1
in	1
our	1
trespasses:	1
for	1
we	1
cannot	1
stand	1
before	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
this.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Ezra	1
had	1
prayed,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
confessed,	1
weeping	1
and	1
casting	1
himself	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
there	1
assembled	1
unto	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
Israel	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
congregation	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
and	1
children:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
wept	1
very	1
sore.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
Shechaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jehiel,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Elam,	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Ezra,	1
We	1
have	1
trespassed	1
against	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
strange	1
wives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
yet	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
in	1
Israel	1
concerning	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
10:3	1
Now	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
wives,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
them,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
my	1
lord,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
tremble	1
at	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
done	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
10:4	1
Arise;	1
for	1
this	1
matter	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
thee:	1
we	1
also	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
thee:	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
courage,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
10:5	1
Then	1
arose	1
Ezra,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel,	1
to	1
swear	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
word.	1
And	1
they	1
sware.	1
	1
10:6	1
Then	1
Ezra	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
Johanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eliashib:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
thither,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
no	1
bread,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water:	1
for	1
he	1
mourned	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
proclamation	1
throughout	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
gather	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Jerusalem;	1
10:8	1
And	1
that	1
whosoever	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
within	1
three	1
days,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
all	1
his	1
substance	1
should	1
be	1
forfeited,	1
and	1
himself	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away.	1
	1
10:9	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
within	1
three	1
days.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
trembling	1
because	1
of	1
this	1
matter,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
rain.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
transgressed,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
strange	1
wives,	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
trespass	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
make	1
confession	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
your	1
fathers,	1
and	1
do	1
his	1
pleasure:	1
and	1
separate	1
yourselves	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
strange	1
wives.	1
	1
10:12	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
so	1
must	1
we	1
do.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
much	1
rain,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
without,	1
neither	1
is	1
this	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
one	1
day	1
or	1
two:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
many	1
that	1
have	1
transgressed	1
in	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
10:14	1
Let	1
now	1
our	1
rulers	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
stand,	1
and	1
let	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
taken	1
strange	1
wives	1
in	1
our	1
cities	1
come	1
at	1
appointed	1
times,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
judges	1
thereof,	1
until	1
the	1
fierce	1
wrath	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
this	1
matter	1
be	1
turned	1
from	1
us.	1
	1
10:15	1
Only	1
Jonathan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Asahel	1
and	1
Jahaziah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Tikvah	1
were	1
employed	1
about	1
this	1
matter:	1
and	1
Meshullam	1
and	1
Shabbethai	1
the	1
Levite	1
helped	1
them.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
did	1
so.	1
And	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest,	1
with	1
certain	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
after	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
fathers,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
names,	1
were	1
separated,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
tenth	1
month	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
strange	1
wives	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
among	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
there	1
were	1
found	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
strange	1
wives:	1
namely,	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Jeshua	1

and	1
his	1

Maaseiah,	1
and	1
Eliezer,	1
and	1
Jarib,	1
and	1
Gedaliah.	1
	1
10:19	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
their	1
hands	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
put	1
away	1
their	1
wives;	1
and	1
being	1
guilty,	1
they	1
offered	1
a	1
ram	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
for	1
their	1
trespass.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1

The	1

1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Nehemiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hachaliah.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Chisleu,	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
1:2	1
That	1
Hanani,	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
brethren,	1
came,	1
he	1
and	1
certain	1
men	1
of	1
Judah;	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
them	1
concerning	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
had	1
escaped,	1
which	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
and	1
concerning	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
remnant	1
that	1
are	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
are	1
in	1
great	1
affliction	1
and	1
reproach:	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
also	1
is	1
broken	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
are	1
burned	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
that	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
wept,	1
and	1
mourned	1
certain	1
days,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
and	1
prayed	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
1:5	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
God,	1
that	1
keepeth	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
observe	1
his	1
commandments:	1
1:6	1
Let	1
thine	1
ear	1
now	1
be	1
attentive,	1
and	1
thine	1
eyes	1
open,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
hear	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
which	1
I	1
pray	1
before	1
thee	1
now,	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
thy	1
servants,	1
and	1
confess	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee:	1
both	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
father's	1
house	1
have	1
sinned.	1
	1
1:7	1
We	1
have	1
dealt	1
very	1
corruptly	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
the	1
commandments,	1
nor	1
the	1
statutes,	1
nor	1
the	1
judgments,	1
which	1
thou	1
commandedst	1
thy	1
servant	1
Moses.	1
	1
1:8	1
Remember,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
thou	1
commandedst	1
thy	1
servant	1
Moses,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
transgress,	1
I	1
will	1
scatter	1
you	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
nations:	1
1:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
turn	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
them;	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
of	1
you	1
cast	1
out	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
them	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
to	1
set	1
my	1
name	1
there.	1
	1
1:10	1
Now	1
these	1
are	1
thy	1
servants	1
and	1
thy	1
people,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
by	1
thy	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
strong	1
hand.	1
	1
1:11	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
now	1
thine	1
ear	1
be	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servants,	1
who	1
desire	1
to	1
fear	1
thy	1
name:	1
and	1
prosper,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
thy	1
servant	1
this	1
day,	1
and	1
grant	1
him	1
mercy	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
man.	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
king's	1
cupbearer.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
Nisan,	1
in	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
wine	1
was	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
king.	1
Now	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
beforetime	1
sad	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
2:2	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Why	1
is	1
thy	1
countenance	1
sad,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
sick?	1
this	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart.	1
Then	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
sore	1
afraid,	1
2:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
the	1
king	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
my	1
countenance	1
be	1
sad,	1
when	1
the	1
city,	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
fathers'	1
sepulchres,	1
lieth	1
waste,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
are	1
consumed	1
with	1
fire?	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
For	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
make	1
request?	1
So	1
I	1
prayed	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
if	1
thy	1
servant	1
have	1
found	1
favour	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
send	1
me	1
unto	1
Judah,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
my	1
fathers'	1
sepulchres,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
build	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
(the	1
queen	1
also	1
sitting	1
by	1
him,)	1
For	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
thy	1
journey	1
be?	1
and	1
when	1
wilt	1
thou	1
return?	1
So	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
send	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
set	1
him	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
Moreover	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
letters	1
be	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
governors	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
convey	1
me	1
over	1
till	1
I	1
come	1
into	1
Judah;	1
2:8	1
And	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
Asaph	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
forest,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
timber	1
to	1
make	1
beams	1
for	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
palace	1
which	1
appertained	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
enter	1
into.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
granted	1
me,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
2:9	1
Then	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
governors	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
king's	1
letters.	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
sent	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
horsemen	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
When	1
Sanballat	1
the	1
Horonite,	1
and	1
Tobiah	1
the	1
servant,	1
the	1
Ammonite,	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
grieved	1
them	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
come	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:11	1
So	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
was	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
I	1
arose	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
I	1
and	1
some	1
few	1
men	1
with	1
me;	1
neither	1
told	1
I	1
any	1
man	1
what	1
my	1
God	1
had	1
put	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
beast	1
with	1
me,	1
save	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
I	1
rode	1
upon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
dragon	1
well,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
dung	1
port,	1
and	1
viewed	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
were	1
broken	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
were	1
consumed	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
fountain,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
king's	1
pool:	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was	1
under	1
me	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
2:15	1
Then	1
went	1
I	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
viewed	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
entered	1
by	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
so	1
returned.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
the	1
rulers	1
knew	1
not	1
whither	1
I	1
went,	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
did;	1
neither	1
had	1
I	1
as	1
yet	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
nobles,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
rulers,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
see	1
the	1
distress	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in,	1
how	1
Jerusalem	1
lieth	1
waste,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof	1
are	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
build	1
up	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
we	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
reproach.	1
	1
2:18	1
Then	1
I	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
my	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
good	1
upon	1
me;	1
as	1
also	1
the	1
king's	1
words	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
build.	1
So	1
they	1
strengthened	1
their	1
hands	1
for	1
this	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
when	1
Sanballat	1
the	1
Horonite,	1
and	1
Tobiah	1
the	1
servant,	1
the	1
Ammonite,	1
and	1
Geshem	1
the	1
Arabian,	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
laughed	1
us	1
to	1
scorn,	1
and	1
despised	1
us,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
thing	1
that	1
ye	1
do?	1
will	1
ye	1
rebel	1
against	1
the	1
king?	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
answered	1
I	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
he	1
will	1
prosper	1
us;	1
therefore	1
we	1
his	1
servants	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
build:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
portion,	1
nor	1
right,	1
nor	1
memorial,	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
Eliashib	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rose	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
they	1
builded	1
the	1
sheep	1
gate;	1
they	1
sanctified	1
it,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
it;	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Meah	1
they	1
sanctified	1
it,	1
unto	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
him	1
builded	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Jericho.	1
And	1
next	1
to	1
them	1
builded	1
Zaccur	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Imri.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
the	1
fish	1
gate	1
did	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Hassenaah	1
build,	1
who	1
also	1
laid	1
the	1
beams	1
thereof,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
thereof,	1
the	1
locks	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
bars	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
them	1
repaired	1
Meremoth	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Urijah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Koz.	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
them	1
repaired	1
Meshullam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Meshezabeel.	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
them	1
repaired	1
Zadok	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Baana.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
Tekoites	1
repaired;	1
but	1
their	1
nobles	1
put	1
not	1
their	1
necks	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:6	1
Moreover	1
the	1
old	1
gate	1
repaired	1
Jehoiada	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Paseah,	1
and	1
Meshullam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Besodeiah;	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
beams	1
thereof,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
locks	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
bars	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
next	1
unto	1
them	1
repaired	1
Melatiah	1
the	1
Gibeonite,	1
and	1
Jadon	1
the	1
Meronothite,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Gibeon,	1
and	1
of	1
Mizpah,	1
unto	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
3:8	1
Next	1

And	1
between	1

up	1
of	1
the	1
corner	1
unto	1
the	1
sheep	1
gate	1
repaired	1
the	1
goldsmiths	1
and	1
the	1
merchants.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Sanballat	1
heard	1
that	1
we	1
builded	1
the	1
wall,	1
he	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
took	1
great	1
indignation,	1
and	1
mocked	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
before	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
do	1
these	1
feeble	1
Jews?	1
will	1
they	1
fortify	1
themselves?	1
will	1
they	1
sacrifice?	1
	1
will	1
they	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
a	1
day?	1
will	1
they	1
revive	1
the	1
stones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heaps	1
of	1
the	1
rubbish	1
which	1
are	1
burned?	1
	1
4:3	1
Now	1
Tobiah	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
was	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Even	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
build,	1
if	1
a	1
fox	1
go	1
up,	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
stone	1
wall.	1
	1
4:4	1
Hear,	1
O	1
our	1
God;	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
despised:	1
and	1
turn	1
their	1
reproach	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
head,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
prey	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
captivity:	1
4:5	1
And	1
cover	1
not	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
their	1
sin	1
be	1
blotted	1
out	1
from	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
provoked	1
thee	1
to	1
anger	1
before	1
the	1
builders.	1
	1
4:6	1
So	1
built	1
we	1
the	1
wall;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
wall	1
was	1
joined	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
thereof:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
work.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Sanballat,	1
and	1
Tobiah,	1
and	1
the	1
Arabians,	1
and	1
the	1
Ammonites,	1
and	1
the	1
Ashdodites,	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
were	1
made	1
up,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
breaches	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
stopped,	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
wroth,	1
4:8	1
And	1
conspired	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
hinder	1
it.	1
	1
4:9	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
made	1
our	1
prayer	1
unto	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
watch	1
against	1
them	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
because	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
Judah	1
said,	1
The	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
of	1
burdens	1
is	1
decayed,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
rubbish;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
our	1
adversaries	1
said,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
know,	1
neither	1
see,	1
till	1
we	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
cause	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
cease.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
by	1
them	1
came,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
us	1
ten	1
times,	1
From	1
all	1
places	1
whence	1
ye	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
us	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
4:13	1
Therefore	1
set	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
places	1
behind	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
higher	1
places,	1
I	1
even	1
set	1
the	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
families	1
with	1
their	1
swords,	1
their	1
spears,	1
and	1
their	1
bows.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
nobles,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rulers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
afraid	1
of	1
them:	1
remember	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
terrible,	1
and	1
fight	1
for	1
your	1
brethren,	1
your	1
sons,	1
and	1
your	1
daughters,	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
your	1
houses.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
our	1
enemies	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
God	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
counsel	1
to	1
nought,	1
that	1
we	1
returned	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
wall,	1
every	1
one	1
unto	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth,	1
that	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
servants	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
both	1
the	1
spears,	1
the	1
shields,	1
and	1
the	1
bows,	1
and	1
the	1
habergeons;	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
were	1
behind	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
4:17	1
They	1
which	1
builded	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
burdens,	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
laded,	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
held	1
a	1
weapon.	1
	1
4:18	1
For	1
the	1
builders,	1
every	1
one	1
had	1
his	1
sword	1
girded	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
so	1
builded.	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sounded	1
the	1
trumpet	1
was	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
nobles,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rulers,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
The	1
work	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
large,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
separated	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
one	1
far	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
4:20	1
In	1
what	1
place	1
therefore	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
resort	1
ye	1
thither	1
unto	1
us:	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
fight	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
4:21	1
So	1
we	1
laboured	1
in	1
the	1
work:	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
the	1
spears	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
till	1
the	1
stars	1
appeared.	1
	1
4:22	1
Likewise	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
servant	1
lodge	1
within	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
guard	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
labour	1
on	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
4:23	1
So	1
neither	1
I,	1
nor	1
my	1
brethren,	1
nor	1
my	1
servants,	1
nor	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
guard	1
which	1
followed	1
me,	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
put	1
off	1
our	1
clothes,	1
saving	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
put	1
them	1
off	1
for	1
washing.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
cry	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
wives	1
against	1
their	1
brethren	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
there	1
were	1
that	1
said,	1
We,	1
our	1
sons,	1
and	1
our	1
daughters,	1
are	1
many:	1
therefore	1
we	1
take	1
up	1
corn	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat,	1
and	1
live.	1
	1
5:3	1
Some	1
also	1
there	1
were	1
that	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
mortgaged	1
our	1
lands,	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
houses,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
buy	1
corn,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dearth.	1
	1
5:4	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
that	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
borrowed	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
tribute,	1
and	1
that	1
upon	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
vineyards.	1
	1
5:5	1
Yet	1
now	1
our	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
our	1
brethren,	1
our	1
children	1
as	1
their	1
children:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
we	1
bring	1
into	1
bondage	1
our	1
sons	1
and	1
our	1
daughters	1
to	1
be	1
servants,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
daughters	1
are	1
brought	1
unto	1
bondage	1
already:	1
neither	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
power	1
to	1
redeem	1
them;	1
for	1
other	1
men	1
have	1
our	1
lands	1
and	1
vineyards.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
angry	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
their	1
cry	1
and	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
5:7	1
Then	1
I	1
consulted	1
with	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
rebuked	1
the	1
nobles,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
exact	1
usury,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
a	1
great	1
assembly	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
We	1
after	1
our	1
ability	1
have	1
redeemed	1
our	1
brethren	1
the	1
Jews,	1
which	1
were	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
will	1
ye	1
even	1
sell	1
your	1
brethren?	1
or	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
sold	1
unto	1
us?	1
Then	1
held	1
they	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
answer.	1
	1
5:9	1
Also	1
I	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
that	1
ye	1
do:	1
ought	1
ye	1
not	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
the	1
heathen	1
our	1
enemies?	1
	1
5:10	1
I	1
likewise,	1
and	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
my	1
servants,	1
might	1
exact	1
of	1
them	1
money	1
and	1
corn:	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
off	1
this	1
usury.	1
	1
5:11	1
Restore,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
this	1
day,	1
their	1
lands,	1
their	1
vineyards,	1
their	1
oliveyards,	1
and	1
their	1
houses,	1
also	1
the	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
corn,	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil,	1
that	1
ye	1
exact	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
We	1
will	1
restore	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
require	1
nothing	1
of	1
them;	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
Then	1
I	1
called	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
promise.	1
	1
5:13	1
Also	1
I	1
shook	1
my	1
lap,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
God	1
shake	1
out	1
every	1
man	1
from	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
labour,	1
that	1
performeth	1
not	1
this	1
promise,	1
even	1
thus	1
be	1
he	1
shaken	1
out,	1
and	1
emptied.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
said,	1
Amen,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
LORD.	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
promise.	1
	1
5:14	1
Moreover	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
governor	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
from	1
the	1
twentieth	1
year	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
two	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
the	1
king,	1
that	1
is,	1
twelve	1
years,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
have	1
not	1
eaten	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
the	1
former	1
governors	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
me	1
were	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
them	1
bread	1
and	1
wine,	1
beside	1
forty	1
shekels	1
of	1
silver;	1
yea,	1
even	1
their	1
servants	1
bare	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
people:	1
but	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
I,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:16	1
Yea,	1
also	1
I	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
this	1
wall,	1
neither	1
bought	1
we	1
any	1
land:	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
servants	1
were	1
gathered	1
thither	1
unto	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
5:17	1
Moreover	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
rulers,	1
beside	1
those	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
us	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
5:18	1
Now	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
me	1
daily	1
was	1
one	1
ox	1
and	1
six	1
choice	1
sheep;	1
also	1
fowls	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
once	1
in	1
ten	1
days	1
store	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
wine:	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
required	1
not	1
I	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
the	1
governor,	1
because	1
the	1
bondage	1
was	1
heavy	1
upon	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
5:19	1
Think	1
upon	1
me,	1
my	1
God,	1
for	1
good,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
6:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
when	1
Sanballat,	1
and	1
Tobiah,	1
and	1
Geshem	1
the	1
Arabian,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
our	1
enemies,	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
builded	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
breach	1
left	1
therein;	1
(though	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
doors	1
upon	1
the	1
gates;)	1
6:2	1
That	1
Sanballat	1
and	1
Geshem	1
sent	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
meet	1
together	1
in	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
villages	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Ono.	1
But	1
they	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
mischief.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
I	1
sent	1
messengers	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
a	1
great	1
work,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
come	1
down:	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
work	1
cease,	1
whilst	1
I	1
leave	1
it,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
6:4	1
Yet	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
me	1
four	1
times	1
after	1
this	1
sort;	1
and	1
I	1
answered	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
manner.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
sent	1
Sanballat	1
his	1
servant	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
the	1
fifth	1
time	1
with	1
an	1
open	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
6:6	1
Wherein	1
was	1
written,	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
Gashmu	1
saith	1
it,	1
that	1
thou	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
think	1
to	1
rebel:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
thou	1
buildest	1
the	1
wall,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
their	1
king,	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
thou	1
hast	1
also	1
appointed	1
prophets	1
to	1
preach	1
of	1
thee	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
Judah:	1
and	1
now	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
words.	1
Come	1
now	1
therefore,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
counsel	1
together.	1
	1
6:8	1
Then	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
such	1
things	1
done	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
but	1
thou	1
feignest	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
heart.	1
	1
6:9	1
For	1
they	1
all	1
made	1
us	1
afraid,	1
saying,	1
Their	1
hands	1
shall	1
be	1
weakened	1
from	1
the	1
work,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
done.	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
God,	1
strengthen	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
6:10	1
Afterward	1
I	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Shemaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Delaiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mehetabeel,	1
who	1
was	1
shut	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Let	1
us	1
meet	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
within	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
slay	1
thee;	1
yea,	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
will	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
slay	1
thee.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Should	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
I	1
flee?	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
there,	1
that,	1
being	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
would	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life?	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
6:12	1
And,	1
lo,	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
him;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
pronounced	1
this	1
prophecy	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
Tobiah	1
and	1
Sanballat	1
had	1
hired	1
him.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
was	1
he	1
hired,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
afraid,	1
and	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
sin,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
matter	1
for	1
an	1
evil	1
report,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
reproach	1
me.	1
	1
6:14	1
My	1
God,	1
think	1
thou	1
upon	1
Tobiah	1
and	1
Sanballat	1
according	1
to	1
these	1
their	1
works,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
prophetess	1
Noadiah,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
fear.	1
	1
6:15	1
So	1
the	1
wall	1
was	1
finished	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fifth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
Elul,	1
in	1
fifty	1
and	1
two	1
days.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
all	1
our	1
enemies	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
us	1
saw	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
cast	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
eyes:	1
for	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
this	1
work	1
was	1
wrought	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
6:17	1
Moreover	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
Judah	1
sent	1
many	1
letters	1
unto	1
Tobiah,	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
Tobiah	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
6:18	1
For	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
in	1
Judah	1
sworn	1
unto	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
of	1
Shechaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Arah;	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
Johanan	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Meshullam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah.	1
	1
6:19	1
Also	1
they	1
reported	1
his	1
good	1
deeds	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
uttered	1
my	1
words	1
to	1
him.	1
And	1
Tobiah	1
sent	1
letters	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
fear.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
wall	1
was	1
built,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
set	1
up	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
the	1
porters	1
and	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
were	1
appointed,	1
7:2	1
That	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
brother	1
Hanani,	1
and	1
Hananiah	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
palace,	1
charge	1
over	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
faithful	1
man,	1
and	1
feared	1
God	1
above	1
many.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
opened	1
until	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
hot;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
stand	1
by,	1
let	1
them	1
shut	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
bar	1
them:	1
and	1
appoint	1
watches	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
watch,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
over	1
against	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:4	1
Now	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
great:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
few	1
therein,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
were	1
not	1
builded.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
my	1
God	1
put	1
into	1
mine	1
heart	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
nobles,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers,	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
reckoned	1
by	1
genealogy.	1
And	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
register	1
of	1
the	1
genealogy	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
found	1
written	1
therein,	1
7:6	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
province,	1
that	1
went	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away,	1
whom	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
carried	1
away,	1
and	1
came	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
to	1
Judah,	1
every	1
one	1
unto	1
his	1
city;	1
7:7	1
Who	1
came	1
with	1
Zerubbabel,	1
Jeshua,	1
Nehemiah,	1
Azariah,	1
Raamiah,	1
Nahamani,	1
Mordecai,	1
Bilshan,	1
Mispereth,	1
Bigvai,	1
Nehum,	1
Baanah.	1
The	1
number,	1
I	1
say,	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
was	1
this;	1
7:8	1
The	1
children	1
of	1

	1
7:65	1
And	1

said	1
unto	1

that	1
they	1

not	1

and	1
they	1

	1
7:68	1

	1
7:70	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
work.	1
The	1
Tirshatha	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
treasure	1
a	1
thousand	1
drams	1
of	1
gold,	1
fifty	1
basons,	1
five	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1

	1
7:71	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1

gave	1

and	1
two	1

	1
7:72	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
gave	1
was	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
drams	1
of	1

	1
7:73	1
So	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1

and	1
the	1

and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
Nethinims,	1
and	1
all	1
Israel,	1
dwelt	1
in	1
their	1
cities;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
seventh	1
month	1
came,	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
as	1
one	1
man	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
water	1
gate;	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ezra	1
the	1
scribe	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
to	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest	1
brought	1
the	1
law	1
before	1
the	1
congregation	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
hear	1
with	1
understanding,	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
he	1
read	1
therein	1
before	1
the	1
street	1
that	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
water	1
gate	1
from	1
the	1
morning	1
until	1
midday,	1
before	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
could	1
understand;	1
and	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
attentive	1
unto	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Ezra	1
the	1
scribe	1
stood	1
upon	1
a	1
pulpit	1
of	1
wood,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
purpose;	1
and	1
beside	1
him	1
stood	1
Mattithiah,	1
and	1
Shema,	1
and	1
Anaiah,	1
and	1
Urijah,	1
and	1
Hilkiah,	1
and	1
Maaseiah,	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand;	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
Pedaiah,	1
and	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Malchiah,	1
and	1
Hashum,	1
and	1
Hashbadana,	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Meshullam.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
Ezra	1
opened	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people;	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
people;)	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
opened	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
up:	1
8:6	1
And	1
Ezra	1
blessed	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
great	1
God.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
answered,	1
Amen,	1
Amen,	1
with	1
lifting	1
up	1
their	1
hands:	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
8:7	1
Also	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
Bani,	1
and	1
Sherebiah,	1
Jamin,	1
Akkub,	1
Shabbethai,	1
Hodijah,	1
Maaseiah,	1
Kelita,	1
Azariah,	1
Jozabad,	1
Hanan,	1
Pelaiah,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
caused	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
law:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
in	1
their	1
place.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
they	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
distinctly,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
sense,	1
and	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
reading.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
Nehemiah,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Tirshatha,	1
and	1
Ezra	1
the	1
priest	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
taught	1
the	1
people,	1
said	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God;	1
mourn	1
not,	1
nor	1
weep.	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
wept,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
8:10	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way,	1
eat	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
sweet,	1
and	1
send	1
portions	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
nothing	1
is	1
prepared:	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
our	1
LORD:	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
sorry;	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
your	1
strength.	1
	1
8:11	1
So	1
the	1
Levites	1
stilled	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
your	1
peace,	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
holy;	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
grieved.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
to	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
portions,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
great	1
mirth,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
understood	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
were	1
declared	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
unto	1
Ezra	1
the	1
scribe,	1
even	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
commanded	1
by	1
Moses,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
should	1
dwell	1
in	1
booths	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
month:	1
8:15	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
publish	1
and	1
proclaim	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
cities,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
mount,	1
and	1
fetch	1
olive	1
branches,	1
and	1
pine	1
branches,	1
and	1
myrtle	1
branches,	1
and	1
palm	1
branches,	1
and	1
branches	1
of	1
thick	1
trees,	1
to	1
make	1
booths,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written.	1
	1
8:16	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
brought	1
them,	1
and	1
made	1
themselves	1
booths,	1
every	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
courts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
gate,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Ephraim.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
made	1
booths,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
the	1
booths:	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Nun	1
unto	1
that	1
day	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
done	1
so.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
very	1
great	1
gladness.	1
	1
8:18	1
Also	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
unto	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
he	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
feast	1
seven	1
days;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
was	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
according	1
unto	1
the	1
manner.	1
	1
9:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
twenty	1
and	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
this	1
month	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
assembled	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
with	1
sackclothes,	1
and	1
earth	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Israel	1
separated	1
themselves	1
from	1
all	1
strangers,	1
and	1
stood	1
and	1
confessed	1
their	1
sins,	1
and	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
they	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
place,	1
and	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
one	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
another	1
fourth	1
part	1
they	1
confessed,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
9:4	1
Then	1
stood	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
Bani,	1
Kadmiel,	1
Shebaniah,	1
Bunni,	1
Sherebiah,	1
Bani,	1
and	1
Chenani,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
9:5	1
Then	1
the	1
Levites,	1
Jeshua,	1
and	1
Kadmiel,	1
Bani,	1
Hashabniah,	1
Sherebiah,	1
Hodijah,	1
Shebaniah,	1
and	1
Pethahiah,	1
said,	1
Stand	1
up	1
and	1
bless	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
and	1
blessed	1
be	1
thy	1
glorious	1
name,	1
which	1
is	1
exalted	1
above	1
all	1
blessing	1
and	1
praise.	1
	1
9:6	1
Thou,	1
even	1
thou,	1
art	1
LORD	1
alone;	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven,	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
heavens,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
host,	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
therein,	1
the	1
seas,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein,	1
and	1
thou	1
preservest	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
worshippeth	1
thee.	1
	1
9:7	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God,	1
who	1
didst	1
choose	1
Abram,	1
and	1
broughtest	1
him	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
Ur	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldees,	1
and	1
gavest	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Abraham;	1
9:8	1
And	1
foundest	1
his	1
heart	1
faithful	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
madest	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
the	1
Hittites,	1
the	1
Amorites,	1
and	1
the	1
Perizzites,	1
and	1
the	1
Jebusites,	1
and	1
the	1
Girgashites,	1
to	1
give	1
it,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
his	1
seed,	1
and	1
hast	1
performed	1
thy	1
words;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
righteous:	1
9:9	1
And	1
didst	1
see	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
heardest	1
their	1
cry	1
by	1
the	1
Red	1
sea;	1
9:10	1
And	1
shewedst	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
upon	1
Pharaoh,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
land:	1
for	1
thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
they	1
dealt	1
proudly	1
against	1
them.	1
So	1
didst	1
thou	1
get	1
thee	1
a	1
name,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
thou	1
didst	1
divide	1
the	1
sea	1
before	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
dry	1
land;	1
and	1
their	1
persecutors	1
thou	1
threwest	1
into	1
the	1
deeps,	1
as	1
a	1
stone	1
into	1
the	1
mighty	1
waters.	1
	1
9:12	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
leddest	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
by	1
a	1
cloudy	1
pillar;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
they	1
should	1
go.	1
	1
9:13	1
Thou	1
camest	1
down	1
also	1
upon	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
and	1
spakest	1
with	1
them	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
gavest	1
them	1
right	1
judgments,	1
and	1
true	1
laws,	1
good	1
statutes	1
and	1
commandments:	1
9:14	1
And	1
madest	1
known	1
unto	1
them	1
thy	1
holy	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
commandedst	1
them	1
precepts,	1
statutes,	1
and	1
laws,	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Moses	1
thy	1
servant:	1
9:15	1
And	1
gavest	1
them	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
for	1
their	1
hunger,	1
and	1
broughtest	1
forth	1
water	1
for	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
for	1
their	1
thirst,	1
and	1
promisedst	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
thou	1
hadst	1
sworn	1
to	1
give	1
them.	1
	1
9:16	1
But	1
they	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
dealt	1
proudly,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
necks,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
to	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
9:17	1
And	1
refused	1
to	1
obey,	1
neither	1
were	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
wonders	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
among	1
them;	1
but	1
hardened	1
their	1
necks,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
rebellion	1
appointed	1
a	1
captain	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
bondage:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
God	1
ready	1
to	1
pardon,	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
forsookest	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
9:18	1
Yea,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
molten	1
calf,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
thy	1
God	1
that	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
had	1
wrought	1
great	1
provocations;	1
9:19	1
Yet	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
manifold	1
mercies	1
forsookest	1
them	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
cloud	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
them	1
by	1
day,	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
neither	1
the	1
pillar	1
of	1
fire	1
by	1
night,	1
to	1
shew	1
them	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
wherein	1
they	1
should	1
go.	1
	1
9:20	1
Thou	1
gavest	1
also	1
thy	1
good	1
spirit	1
to	1
instruct	1
them,	1
and	1
withheldest	1
not	1
thy	1
manna	1
from	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
gavest	1
them	1
water	1
for	1
their	1
thirst.	1
	1
9:21	1
Yea,	1
forty	1
years	1
didst	1
thou	1
sustain	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
lacked	1
nothing;	1
their	1
clothes	1
waxed	1
not	1
old,	1
and	1
their	1
feet	1
swelled	1
not.	1
	1
9:22	1
Moreover	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
didst	1
divide	1
them	1
into	1
corners:	1
so	1
they	1
possessed	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sihon,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Heshbon,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Og	1
king	1
of	1
Bashan.	1
	1
9:23	1
Their	1
children	1
also	1
multipliedst	1
thou	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
broughtest	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land,	1
concerning	1
which	1
thou	1
hadst	1
promised	1
to	1
their	1
fathers,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
possess	1
it.	1
	1
9:24	1
So	1
the	1
children	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
possessed	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
thou	1
subduedst	1
before	1
them	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
and	1
gavest	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
hands,	1
with	1
their	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
strong	1
cities,	1
and	1
a	1
fat	1
land,	1
and	1
possessed	1
houses	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
goods,	1
wells	1
digged,	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
oliveyards,	1
and	1
fruit	1
trees	1
in	1
abundance:	1
so	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled,	1
and	1
became	1
fat,	1
and	1
delighted	1
themselves	1
in	1
thy	1
great	1
goodness.	1
	1
9:26	1
Nevertheless	1
they	1
were	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
rebelled	1
against	1
thee,	1
and	1
cast	1
thy	1
law	1
behind	1
their	1
backs,	1
and	1
slew	1
thy	1
prophets	1
which	1
testified	1
against	1
them	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
wrought	1
great	1
provocations.	1
	1
9:27	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
who	1
vexed	1
them:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
trouble,	1
when	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
thou	1
heardest	1
them	1
from	1
heaven;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
manifold	1
mercies	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
saviours,	1
who	1
saved	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
their	1
enemies.	1
	1
9:28	1
But	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
rest,	1
they	1
did	1
evil	1
again	1
before	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
leftest	1
thou	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
their	1
enemies,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
dominion	1
over	1
them:	1
yet	1
when	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
thee,	1
thou	1
heardest	1
them	1
from	1
heaven;	1
and	1
many	1
times	1
didst	1
thou	1
deliver	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
mercies;	1
9:29	1
And	1
testifiedst	1
against	1
them,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
thy	1
law:	1
yet	1
they	1
dealt	1
proudly,	1
and	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
thy	1
commandments,	1
but	1
sinned	1
against	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
(which	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
do,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them;)	1
and	1
withdrew	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
neck,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
9:30	1
Yet	1
many	1
years	1
didst	1
thou	1
forbear	1
them,	1
and	1
testifiedst	1
against	1
them	1
by	1
thy	1
spirit	1
in	1
thy	1
prophets:	1
yet	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
give	1
ear:	1
therefore	1
gavest	1
thou	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
lands.	1
	1
9:31	1
Nevertheless	1
for	1
thy	1
great	1
mercies'	1
sake	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
utterly	1
consume	1
them,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
them;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful	1
God.	1
	1
9:32	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
our	1
God,	1
the	1
great,	1
the	1
mighty,	1
and	1
the	1
terrible	1
God,	1
who	1
keepest	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy,	1
let	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
seem	1
little	1
before	1
thee,	1
that	1
hath	1
come	1
upon	1
us,	1
on	1
our	1
kings,	1
on	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
priests,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
prophets,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
thy	1
people,	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Assyria	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
9:33	1
Howbeit	1
thou	1
art	1
just	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
upon	1
us;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
right,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly:	1
9:34	1
Neither	1
have	1
our	1
kings,	1
our	1
princes,	1
our	1
priests,	1
nor	1
our	1
fathers,	1

	1

For	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
served	1
thee	1
in	1

in	1
thy	1

them,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1

land	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
before	1
them,	1
neither	1
turned	1
they	1
from	1
their	1
wicked	1
works.	1
	1
9:36	1
Behold,	1
we	1
are	1

and	1
for	1
the	1

that	1
thou	1
gavest	1
unto	1
our	1

to	1
eat	1
the	1

thereof	1
and	1
the	1

thereof,	1
behold,	1
we	1
are	1
servants	1
in	1
it:	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
yieldeth	1
much	1
increase	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
over	1
us	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
sins:	1
also	1
they	1

dominion	1
over	1
our	1

and	1
over	1

at	1

we	1
are	1
in	1
great	1
distress.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
because	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
we	1
make	1
a	1

	1
12:27	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
they	1
sought	1
the	1
Levites	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
places,	1
to	1
bring	1

with	1
singing,	1
with	1

	1
12:28	1
And	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
singers	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together,	1
both	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
country	1
round	1
about	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
Netophathi;	1
12:29	1
Also	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1

and	1

for	1
the	1
singers	1
had	1
builded	1
them	1
villages	1
round	1
about	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:30	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1

purified	1
themselves,	1
and	1
purified	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
12:31	1
Then	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
appointed	1
two	1
great	1
companies	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
whereof	1
one	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
wall	1
toward	1
the	1
dung	1
gate:	1
12:32	1
And	1
after	1
them	1
went	1
Hoshaiah,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah,	1
12:33	1
And	1
Azariah,	1

certain	1
of	1
the	1
priests'	1
sons	1
with	1
trumpets;	1
namely,	1
Zechariah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jonathan,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shemaiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mattaniah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Michaiah,	1
the	1
son	1

Zaccur,	1
the	1

12:36	1
And	1
his	1
brethren,	1

with	1
the	1

instruments	1
of	1
David	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Ezra	1
the	1
scribe	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
12:37	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
fountain	1
gate,	1
which	1
was	1
over	1
against	1
them,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
stairs	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
at	1
the	1
going	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
above	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
water	1
gate	1
eastward.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
company	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
gave	1
thanks	1
went	1
over	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
after	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
from	1
beyond	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
furnaces	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
broad	1
wall;	1
12:39	1
And	1
from	1
above	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
old	1
gate,	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
fish	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel,	1
and	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Meah,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
sheep	1
gate:	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
gate.	1
	1
12:40	1
So	1
stood	1
the	1
two	1
companies	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
gave	1
thanks	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
I,	1
and	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
with	1
me:	1
12:41	1
And	1
the	1
priests;	1
Eliakim,	1
Maaseiah,	1
Miniamin,	1
Michaiah,	1
Elioenai,	1
Zechariah,	1
and	1
Hananiah,	1
with	1
trumpets;	1
12:42	1
And	1
Maaseiah,	1
and	1
Shemaiah,	1
and	1
Eleazar,	1
and	1
Uzzi,	1
and	1
Jehohanan,	1
and	1
Malchijah,	1
and	1
Elam,	1
and	1
Ezer.	1
And	1
the	1
singers	1
sang	1
loud,	1
with	1
Jezrahiah	1
their	1
overseer.	1
	1
12:43	1
Also	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
offered	1
great	1
sacrifices,	1
and	1
rejoiced:	1
for	1
God	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
rejoice	1
with	1
great	1
joy:	1
the	1
wives	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
rejoiced:	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
heard	1
even	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
12:44	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
were	1
some	1
appointed	1
over	1
the	1
chambers	1
for	1
the	1
treasures,	1
for	1
the	1
offerings,	1
for	1
the	1
firstfruits,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
tithes,	1
to	1
gather	1
into	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
the	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites:	1
for	1
Judah	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
waited.	1
	1
12:45	1
And	1
both	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
the	1
porters	1
kept	1
the	1
ward	1
of	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
ward	1
of	1
the	1
purification,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
of	1
Solomon	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
12:46	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
Asaph	1
of	1
old	1
there	1
were	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
songs	1
of	1
praise	1
and	1
thanksgiving	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
all	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Zerubbabel,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Nehemiah,	1
gave	1
the	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
the	1
porters,	1
every	1
day	1
his	1
portion:	1
and	1
they	1
sanctified	1
holy	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
Levites;	1
and	1
the	1
Levites	1
sanctified	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Aaron.	1
	1
13:1	1
On	1
that	1
day	1
they	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
therein	1
was	1
found	1
written,	1
that	1
the	1
Ammonite	1
and	1
the	1
Moabite	1
should	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
ever;	1
13:2	1
Because	1
they	1
met	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
with	1
water,	1
but	1
hired	1
Balaam	1
against	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
curse	1
them:	1
howbeit	1
our	1
God	1
turned	1
the	1
curse	1
into	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
13:3	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
they	1
separated	1
from	1
Israel	1
all	1
the	1
mixed	1
multitude.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
before	1
this,	1
Eliashib	1
the	1
priest,	1
having	1
the	1
oversight	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
was	1
allied	1
unto	1
Tobiah:	1
13:5	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
chamber,	1
where	1
aforetime	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
the	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
the	1
vessels,	1
and	1
the	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
corn,	1
the	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil,	1
which	1
was	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Levites,	1
and	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
the	1
porters;	1
and	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
the	1
priests.	1
	1
13:6	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
was	1
not	1
I	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
and	1
thirtieth	1
year	1
of	1
Artaxerxes	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
after	1
certain	1
days	1
obtained	1
I	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
13:7	1
And	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
understood	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
that	1
Eliashib	1
did	1
for	1
Tobiah,	1
in	1
preparing	1
him	1
a	1
chamber	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
it	1
grieved	1
me	1
sore:	1
therefore	1
I	1
cast	1
forth	1
all	1
the	1
household	1
stuff	1
to	1
Tobiah	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chamber.	1
	1
13:9	1
Then	1
I	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
cleansed	1
the	1
chambers:	1
and	1
thither	1
brought	1
I	1
again	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
with	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
frankincense.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
Levites	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
given	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
Levites	1
and	1
the	1
singers,	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
work,	1
were	1
fled	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
field.	1
	1
13:11	1
Then	1
contended	1
I	1
with	1
the	1
rulers,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
forsaken?	1
And	1
I	1
gathered	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
place.	1
	1
13:12	1
Then	1
brought	1
all	1
Judah	1
the	1
tithe	1
of	1
the	1
corn	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
and	1
the	1
oil	1
unto	1
the	1
treasuries.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
I	1
made	1
treasurers	1
over	1
the	1
treasuries,	1
Shelemiah	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
Zadok	1
the	1
scribe,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Levites,	1
Pedaiah:	1
and	1
next	1
to	1
them	1
was	1
Hanan	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zaccur,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mattaniah:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
faithful,	1
and	1
their	1
office	1
was	1
to	1
distribute	1
unto	1
their	1
brethren.	1
	1
13:14	1
Remember	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
concerning	1
this,	1
and	1
wipe	1
not	1
out	1
my	1
good	1
deeds	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
offices	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:15	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
saw	1
I	1
in	1
Judah	1
some	1
treading	1
wine	1
presses	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
bringing	1
in	1
sheaves,	1
and	1
lading	1
asses;	1
as	1
also	1
wine,	1
grapes,	1
and	1
figs,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
burdens,	1
which	1
they	1
brought	1
into	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
and	1
I	1
testified	1
against	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
wherein	1
they	1
sold	1
victuals.	1
	1
13:16	1
There	1
dwelt	1
men	1
of	1
Tyre	1
also	1
therein,	1
which	1
brought	1
fish,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
ware,	1
and	1
sold	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:17	1
Then	1
I	1
contended	1
with	1
the	1
nobles	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
evil	1
thing	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
ye	1
do,	1
and	1
profane	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
13:18	1
Did	1
not	1
your	1
fathers	1
thus,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
our	1
God	1
bring	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
city?	1
yet	1
ye	1
bring	1
more	1
wrath	1
upon	1
Israel	1
by	1
profaning	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
dark	1
before	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
I	1
commanded	1
that	1
the	1
gates	1
should	1
be	1
shut,	1
and	1
charged	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
opened	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
sabbath:	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
servants	1
set	1
I	1
at	1
the	1
gates,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
no	1
burden	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
13:20	1
So	1
the	1
merchants	1
and	1
sellers	1
of	1
all	1
kind	1
of	1
ware	1
lodged	1
without	1
Jerusalem	1
once	1
or	1
twice.	1
	1
13:21	1
Then	1
I	1
testified	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
lodge	1
ye	1
about	1
the	1
wall?	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
so	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
you.	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
came	1
they	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
I	1
commanded	1
the	1
Levites	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cleanse	1
themselves,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
gates,	1
to	1
sanctify	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
Remember	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
concerning	1
this	1
also,	1
and	1
spare	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
thy	1
mercy.	1
	1
13:23	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
also	1
saw	1
I	1
Jews	1
that	1
had	1
married	1
wives	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
of	1
Moab:	1
13:24	1
And	1
their	1
children	1
spake	1
half	1
in	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
language,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
each	1
people.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
I	1
contended	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
cursed	1
them,	1
and	1
smote	1
certain	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
plucked	1
off	1
their	1
hair,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
swear	1
by	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
your	1
daughters	1
unto	1
their	1
sons,	1
nor	1
take	1
their	1
daughters	1
unto	1
your	1
sons,	1
or	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
13:26	1
Did	1
not	1
Solomon	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
sin	1
by	1
these	1
things?	1
yet	1
among	1
many	1
nations	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
king	1
like	1
him,	1
who	1
was	1
beloved	1
of	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
made	1
him	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
Israel:	1
nevertheless	1
even	1
him	1
did	1
outlandish	1
women	1
cause	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
13:27	1
Shall	1
we	1
then	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
evil,	1
to	1
transgress	1
against	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
marrying	1
strange	1
wives?	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joiada,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Eliashib	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
was	1
son	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
Sanballat	1
the	1
Horonite:	1
therefore	1
I	1
chased	1
him	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
13:29	1
Remember	1
them,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
defiled	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
and	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Levites.	1
	1
13:30	1
Thus	1
cleansed	1
I	1
them	1
from	1
all	1
strangers,	1
and	1
appointed	1
the	1
wards	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Levites,	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
business;	1
13:31	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
wood	1
offering,	1
at	1
times	1
appointed,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
firstfruits.	1
Remember	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Esther	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
(this	1
is	1
Ahasuerus	1
which	1
reigned,	1
from	1
India	1
even	1
unto	1
Ethiopia,	1
over	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
seven	1
and	1
twenty	1
provinces:)	1
1:2	1
That	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
1:3	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
princes	1
and	1
his	1
servants;	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Persia	1
and	1
Media,	1
the	1
nobles	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
being	1
before	1
him:	1
1:4	1
When	1
he	1
shewed	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glorious	1
kingdom	1
and	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
excellent	1
majesty	1
many	1
days,	1
even	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fourscore	1
days.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
days	1
were	1
expired,	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
present	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
both	1
unto	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
seven	1
days,	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
palace;	1
1:6	1
Where	1
were	1
white,	1
green,	1
and	1
blue,	1
hangings,	1
fastened	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
fine	1
linen	1
and	1
purple	1
to	1
silver	1
rings	1
and	1
pillars	1
of	1
marble:	1
the	1
beds	1
were	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
upon	1
a	1
pavement	1
of	1
red,	1
and	1
blue,	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
black,	1
marble.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
drink	1
in	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold,	1
(the	1
vessels	1
being	1
diverse	1
one	1
from	1
another,)	1
and	1
royal	1
wine	1
in	1
abundance,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
the	1
drinking	1
was	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law;	1
none	1
did	1
compel:	1
for	1
so	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
pleasure.	1
	1
1:9	1
Also	1
Vashti	1
the	1
queen	1
made	1
a	1
feast	1
for	1
the	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
royal	1
house	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
king	1
Ahasuerus.	1
	1
1:10	1
On	1
the	1
seventh	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
merry	1
with	1
wine,	1
he	1
commanded	1
Mehuman,	1
Biztha,	1
Harbona,	1
Bigtha,	1
and	1
Abagtha,	1
Zethar,	1
and	1
Carcas,	1
the	1
seven	1
chamberlains	1
that	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Ahasuerus	1
the	1
king,	1
1:11	1
To	1
bring	1
Vashti	1
the	1
queen	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
the	1
crown	1
royal,	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
her	1
beauty:	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
on.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
the	1
queen	1
Vashti	1
refused	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
by	1
his	1
chamberlains:	1
therefore	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
burned	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
which	1
knew	1
the	1
times,	1
(for	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
king's	1
manner	1
toward	1
all	1
that	1
knew	1
law	1
and	1
judgment:	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
unto	1
him	1
was	1
Carshena,	1
Shethar,	1
Admatha,	1
Tarshish,	1
Meres,	1
Marsena,	1
and	1
Memucan,	1
the	1
seven	1
princes	1
of	1
Persia	1
and	1
Media,	1
which	1
saw	1
the	1
king's	1
face,	1
and	1
which	1
sat	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom;)	1
1:15	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
the	1
queen	1
Vashti	1
according	1
to	1
law,	1
because	1
she	1
hath	1
not	1
performed	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
by	1
the	1
chamberlains?	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
Memucan	1
answered	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
Vashti	1
the	1
queen	1
hath	1
not	1
done	1
wrong	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
this	1
deed	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
shall	1
come	1
abroad	1
unto	1
all	1
women,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
despise	1
their	1
husbands	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
reported,	1
The	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
commanded	1
Vashti	1
the	1
queen	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
she	1
came	1
not.	1
	1
1:18	1
Likewise	1
shall	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
Persia	1
and	1
Media	1
say	1
this	1
day	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
princes,	1
which	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
deed	1
of	1
the	1
queen.	1
Thus	1
shall	1
there	1
arise	1
too	1
much	1
contempt	1
and	1
wrath.	1
	1
1:19	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
there	1
go	1
a	1
royal	1
commandment	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
written	1
among	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Persians	1
and	1
the	1
Medes,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
altered,	1
That	1
Vashti	1
come	1
no	1
more	1
before	1
king	1
Ahasuerus;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
give	1
her	1
royal	1
estate	1
unto	1
another	1
that	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
she.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king's	1
decree	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
shall	1
be	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
his	1
empire,	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
great,)	1
all	1
the	1
wives	1
shall	1
give	1
to	1
their	1
husbands	1
honour,	1
both	1
to	1
great	1
and	1
small.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
princes;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Memucan:	1
1:22	1
For	1
he	1
sent	1
letters	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
provinces,	1
into	1
every	1
province	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
writing	1
thereof,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
people	1
after	1
their	1
language,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
bear	1
rule	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
published	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
every	1
people.	1
	1
2:1	1
After	1
these	1
things,	1
when	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
was	1
appeased,	1
he	1
remembered	1
Vashti,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
decreed	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king's	1
servants	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
there	1
be	1
fair	1
young	1
virgins	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
king:	1
2:3	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
king	1
appoint	1
officers	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
gather	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
fair	1
young	1
virgins	1
unto	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
women,	1
unto	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
Hege	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain,	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
women;	1
and	1
let	1
their	1
things	1
for	1
purification	1
be	1
given	1
them:	1
2:4	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
maiden	1
which	1
pleaseth	1
the	1
king	1
be	1
queen	1
instead	1
of	1
Vashti.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
pleased	1
the	1
king;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
2:5	1
Now	1
in	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Mordecai,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jair,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shimei,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Kish,	1
a	1
Benjamite;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
the	1
captivity	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
Jeconiah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
had	1
carried	1
away.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
up	1
Hadassah,	1
that	1
is,	1
Esther,	1
his	1
uncle's	1
daughter:	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
father	1
nor	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
was	1
fair	1
and	1
beautiful;	1
whom	1
Mordecai,	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
were	1
dead,	1
took	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
daughter.	1
	1
2:8	1
So	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
and	1
his	1
decree	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
when	1
many	1
maidens	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
Shushan	1
the	1
palace,	1
to	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
Hegai,	1
that	1
Esther	1
was	1
brought	1
also	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
house,	1
to	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
Hegai,	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
women.	1
	1
2:9	1
And	1
the	1
maiden	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
she	1
obtained	1
kindness	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
speedily	1
gave	1
her	1
her	1
things	1
for	1
purification,	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
belonged	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
seven	1
maidens,	1
which	1
were	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
her,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
house:	1
and	1
he	1
preferred	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
unto	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
women.	1
	1
2:10	1
Esther	1
had	1
not	1
shewed	1
her	1
people	1
nor	1
her	1
kindred:	1
for	1
Mordecai	1
had	1
charged	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
shew	1
it.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
Mordecai	1
walked	1
every	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
women's	1
house,	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
Esther	1
did,	1
and	1
what	1
should	1
become	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
when	1
every	1
maid's	1
turn	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
after	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
twelve	1
months,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
women,	1
(for	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
purifications	1
accomplished,	1
to	1
wit,	1
six	1
months	1
with	1
oil	1
of	1
myrrh,	1
and	1
six	1
months	1
with	1
sweet	1
odours,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
women;)	1
2:13	1
Then	1
thus	1
came	1
every	1
maiden	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
desired	1
was	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
women	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
house.	1
	1
2:14	1
In	1
the	1
evening	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
she	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
women,	1
to	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
Shaashgaz,	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain,	1
which	1
kept	1
the	1
concubines:	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
no	1
more,	1
except	1
the	1
king	1
delighted	1
in	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
2:15	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
Esther,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abihail	1
the	1
uncle	1
of	1
Mordecai,	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
her	1
for	1
his	1
daughter,	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
she	1
required	1
nothing	1
but	1
what	1
Hegai	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain,	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
women,	1
appointed.	1
And	1
Esther	1
obtained	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
looked	1
upon	1
her.	1
	1
2:16	1
So	1
Esther	1
was	1
taken	1
unto	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
into	1
his	1
house	1
royal	1
in	1
the	1
tenth	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Tebeth,	1
in	1
the	1
seventh	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
loved	1
Esther	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
she	1
obtained	1
grace	1
and	1
favour	1
in	1
his	1
sight	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
virgins;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
set	1
the	1
royal	1
crown	1
upon	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
queen	1
instead	1
of	1
Vashti.	1
	1
2:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
unto	1
all	1
his	1
princes	1
and	1
his	1
servants,	1
even	1
Esther's	1
feast;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
release	1
to	1
the	1
provinces,	1
and	1
gave	1
gifts,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
virgins	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
then	1
Mordecai	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
gate.	1
	1
2:20	1
Esther	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
shewed	1
her	1
kindred	1
nor	1
her	1
people;	1
as	1
Mordecai	1
had	1
charged	1
her:	1
for	1
Esther	1
did	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
Mordecai,	1
like	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:21	1
In	1
those	1
days,	1
while	1
Mordecai	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
gate,	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlains,	1
Bigthan	1
and	1
Teresh,	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
kept	1
the	1
door,	1
were	1
wroth,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
king	1
Ahasuerus.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
Mordecai,	1
who	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
Esther	1
the	1
queen;	1
and	1
Esther	1
certified	1
the	1
king	1
thereof	1
in	1
Mordecai's	1
name.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
when	1
inquisition	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
out;	1
therefore	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
chronicles	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
did	1
king	1
Ahasuerus	1
promote	1
Haman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammedatha	1
the	1
Agagite,	1
and	1
advanced	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
seat	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
servants,	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
gate,	1
bowed,	1
and	1
reverenced	1
Haman:	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
so	1
commanded	1
concerning	1
him.	1
But	1
Mordecai	1
bowed	1
not,	1
nor	1
did	1
him	1
reverence.	1
	1
3:3	1
Then	1
the	1
king's	1
servants,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
gate,	1
said	1
unto	1
Mordecai,	1
Why	1
transgressest	1
thou	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment?	1
	1
3:4	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
they	1
spake	1
daily	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hearkened	1
not	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
told	1
Haman,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
Mordecai's	1
matters	1
would	1
stand:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
when	1
Haman	1
saw	1
that	1
Mordecai	1
bowed	1
not,	1
nor	1
did	1
him	1
reverence,	1
then	1
was	1
Haman	1
full	1
of	1
wrath.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
he	1
thought	1
scorn	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
Mordecai	1
alone;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
shewed	1
him	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mordecai:	1
wherefore	1
Haman	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
were	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
even	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Mordecai.	1
	1
3:7	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
month	1
Nisan,	1
in	1
the	1
twelfth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
they	1
cast	1
Pur,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
lot,	1
before	1
Haman	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
from	1
month	1
to	1
month,	1
to	1
the	1
twelfth	1
month,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
month	1
Adar.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
Haman	1
said	1
unto	1
king	1
Ahasuerus,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
people	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
and	1
dispersed	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom;	1
and	1
their	1
laws	1
are	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
people;	1
neither	1
keep	1
they	1
the	1
king's	1
laws:	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
profit	1
to	1
suffer	1
them.	1
	1
3:9	1
If	1
it	1
please	1
the	1
king,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
written	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
ten	1
thousand	1
talents	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
king's	1
treasuries.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
his	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
unto	1
Haman	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hammedatha	1
the	1
Agagite,	1
the	1
Jews'	1
enemy.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
Haman,	1
The	1
silver	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
thee,	1
the	1
people	1
also,	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
it	1
seemeth	1
good	1
to	1
thee.	1
	1
