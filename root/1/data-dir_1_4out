And	1
at	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
four	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
measures:	1
and	1
three	1
gates;	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Simeon,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Issachar,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
48:34	1
At	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
four	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred,	1
with	1
their	1
three	1
gates;	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Gad,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Asher,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
48:35	1
It	1
was	1
round	1
about	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
measures:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1

The	1
LORD	1

	1
	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Daniel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
with	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
into	1
the	1
treasure	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ashpenaz	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
eunuchs,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
seed,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princes;	1
1:4	1
Children	1
in	1
whom	1
was	1
no	1
blemish,	1
but	1
well	1
favoured,	1
and	1
skilful	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
cunning	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding	1
science,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
ability	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
palace,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
might	1
teach	1
the	1
learning	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
appointed	1
them	1
a	1
daily	1
provision	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
so	1
nourishing	1
them	1
three	1
years,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
they	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:6	1
Now	1
among	1
these	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
1:7	1
Unto	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
gave	1
names:	1
for	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
of	1
Shadrach;	1
and	1
to	1
Mishael,	1
of	1
Meshach;	1
and	1
to	1
Azariah,	1
of	1
Abednego.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
Daniel	1
purposed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
defile	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
therefore	1
he	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
defile	1
himself.	1
	1
1:9	1
Now	1
God	1
had	1
brought	1
Daniel	1
into	1
favour	1
and	1
tender	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
your	1
meat	1
and	1
your	1
drink:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
see	1
your	1
faces	1
worse	1
liking	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
sort?	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
me	1
endanger	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
to	1
Melzar,	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
1:12	1
Prove	1
thy	1
servants,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
ten	1
days;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
us	1
pulse	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
water	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
let	1
our	1
countenances	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat:	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
seest,	1
deal	1
with	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
and	1
proved	1
them	1
ten	1
days.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
ten	1
days	1
their	1
countenances	1
appeared	1
fairer	1
and	1
fatter	1
in	1
flesh	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat.	1
	1
1:16	1
Thus	1
Melzar	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
drink;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
pulse.	1
	1
1:17	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
four	1
children,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
knowledge	1
and	1
skill	1
in	1
all	1
learning	1
and	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
Daniel	1
had	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
visions	1
and	1
dreams.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
in,	1
then	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
brought	1
them	1
in	1
before	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
communed	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
all	1
was	1
found	1
none	1
like	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
therefore	1
stood	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
enquired	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
ten	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
and	1
astrologers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
realm.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
Daniel	1
continued	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Cyrus.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
dreamed	1
dreams,	1
wherewith	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
brake	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
magicians,	1
and	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
and	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
dreams.	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
Syriack,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
tell	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me:	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
with	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
your	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shew	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
me	1
gifts	1
and	1
rewards	1
and	1
great	1
honour:	1
therefore	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
answered	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
king	1
tell	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
certainty	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
gain	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
decree	1
for	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
prepared	1
lying	1
and	1
corrupt	1
words	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
me,	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
be	1
changed:	1
therefore	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
Chaldeans	1
answered	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
the	1
king's	1
matter:	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
king,	1
lord,	1
nor	1
ruler,	1
that	1
asked	1
such	1
things	1
at	1
any	1
magician,	1
or	1
astrologer,	1
or	1
Chaldean.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
rare	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
requireth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
except	1
the	1
gods,	1
whose	1
dwelling	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
flesh.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
very	1
furious,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
decree	1
went	1
forth	1
that	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
slain;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
to	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
with	1
counsel	1
and	1
wisdom	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
guard,	1
which	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
2:15	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
king's	1
captain,	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
so	1
hasty	1
from	1
the	1
king?	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Daniel.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
his	1
companions:	1
2:18	1
That	1
they	1
would	1
desire	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
concerning	1
this	1
secret;	1
that	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
should	1
not	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:19	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
secret	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
in	1
a	1
night	1
vision.	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
blessed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:20	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
for	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might	1
are	1
his:	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
changeth	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons:	1
he	1
removeth	1
kings,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
kings:	1
he	1
giveth	1
wisdom	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
understanding:	1
2:22	1
He	1
revealeth	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
secret	1
things:	1
he	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:23	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
and	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
who	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
what	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
now	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
king's	1
matter.	1
	1
2:24	1
Therefore	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Arioch,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
ordained	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him;	1
Destroy	1
not	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
bring	1
me	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:25	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
brought	1
in	1
Daniel	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:26	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
Art	1
thou	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof?	1
	1
2:27	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
secret	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
demanded	1
cannot	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
soothsayers,	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
2:28	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets,	1
and	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
Thy	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
thy	1
head	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
are	1
these;	1
2:29	1
As	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
came	1
into	1
thy	1
mind	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
what	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
thee	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
2:30	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
this	1
secret	1
is	1
not	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
any	1
wisdom	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
living,	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
that	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
thy	1
heart.	1
	1
2:31	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
sawest,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
image.	1
This	1
great	1
image,	1
whose	1
brightness	1
was	1
excellent,	1
stood	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
thereof	1
was	1
terrible.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
image's	1
head	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
gold,	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
of	1
silver,	1
his	1
belly	1
and	1
his	1
thighs	1
of	1
brass,	1
2:33	1
His	1
legs	1
of	1
iron,	1
his	1
feet	1
part	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay.	1
	1
2:34	1
Thou	1
sawest	1
till	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
without	1
hands,	1
which	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
clay,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
to	1
pieces.	1
	1
2:35	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces	1
together,	1
and	1
became	1
like	1
the	1
chaff	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
threshingfloors;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
no	1
place	1
was	1
found	1
for	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
mountain,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
2:36	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
dream;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:37	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
art	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
kings:	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
power,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
dwell,	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
them	1
all.	1
Thou	1
art	1
this	1
head	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
after	1
thee	1
shall	1
arise	1
another	1
kingdom	1
inferior	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
another	1
third	1
kingdom	1
of	1
brass,	1
which	1
shall	1
bear	1
rule	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
as	1
iron:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
iron	1
breaketh	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
subdueth	1
all	1
things:	1
and	1
as	1
iron	1
that	1
breaketh	1
all	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
bruise.	1
	1
2:41	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
toes,	1
part	1
of	1
potters'	1
clay,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
divided;	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
iron,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
toes	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
were	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay,	1
so	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
partly	1
strong,	1
and	1
partly	1
broken.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay,	1
they	1
shall	1
mingle	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
cleave	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
iron	1
is	1
not	1
mixed	1
with	1
clay.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
these	1
kings	1
shall	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
which	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
other	1
people,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
consume	1
all	1
these	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:45	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
without	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold;	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
the	1
dream	1
is	1
certain,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
sure.	1
	1
2:46	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
offer	1
an	1
oblation	1
and	1
sweet	1
odours	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
2:47	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
a	1
Lord	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
a	1
revealer	1
of	1
secrets,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
couldest	1
reveal	1
this	1
secret.	1
	1
2:48	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
Daniel	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
many	1
great	1
gifts,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
governors	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:49	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
but	1
Daniel	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
an	1
image	1
of	1
gold,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
six	1
cubits:	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Dura,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
3:2	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:3	1
Then	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
an	1
herald	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
To	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
commanded,	1
O	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
3:5	1
That	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
set	1
up:	1
3:6	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
shall	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:7	1
Therefore	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
languages,	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:8	1
Wherefore	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
certain	1
Chaldeans	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
accused	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
3:9	1
They	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:10	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
hast	1
made	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image:	1
3:11	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:12	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
Jews	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego;	1
these	1
men,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
not	1
regarded	1
thee:	1
they	1
serve	1
not	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
in	1
his	1
rage	1
and	1
fury	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
these	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:14	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
true,	1
O	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
serve	1
my	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
up?	1
	1
3:15	1
Now	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
ready	1
that	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made;	1
well:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
worship	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace;	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
God	1
that	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hands?	1
	1
3:16	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
careful	1
to	1
answer	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
our	1
God	1
whom	1
we	1
serve	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:19	1
Then	1
was	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
full	1
of	1
fury,	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
visage	1
was	1
changed	1
against	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego:	1
therefore	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
heat	1
the	1
furnace	1
one	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
heated.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
most	1
mighty	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
bind	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:21	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
their	1
coats,	1
their	1
hosen,	1
and	1
their	1
hats,	1
and	1
their	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:22	1
Therefore	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was	1
urgent,	1
and	1
the	1
furnace	1
exceeding	1
hot,	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
slew	1
those	1
men	1
that	1
took	1
up	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
these	1
three	1
men,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
fell	1
down	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
astonied,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
counsellors,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
three	1
men	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
True,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
see	1
four	1
men	1
loose,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
hurt;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:26	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
Then	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
the	1
princes,	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
counsellors,	1
being	1
gathered	1
together,	1
saw	1
these	1
men,	1
upon	1
whose	1
bodies	1
the	1
fire	1
had	1
no	1
power,	1
nor	1
was	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
their	1
head	1
singed,	1
neither	1
were	1
their	1
coats	1
changed,	1
nor	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
fire	1
had	1
passed	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
3:28	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
who	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
trusted	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
changed	1
the	1
king's	1
word,	1
and	1
yielded	1
their	1
bodies,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
serve	1
nor	1
worship	1
any	1
god,	1
except	1
their	1
own	1
God.	1
	1
3:29	1
Therefore	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
every	1
people,	1
nation,	1
and	1
language,	1
which	1
speak	1
any	1
thing	1
amiss	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill:	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
God	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
after	1
this	1
sort.	1
	1
3:30	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
promoted	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king,	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
that	1
the	1
high	1
God	1
hath	1
wrought	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
4:3	1
How	1
great	1
are	1
his	1
signs!	1
and	1
how	1
mighty	1
are	1
his	1
wonders!	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
4:4	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
was	1
at	1
rest	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
in	1
my	1
palace:	1
4:5	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
afraid,	1
and	1
the	1
thoughts	1
upon	1
my	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
4:6	1
Therefore	1
made	1
I	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers:	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream	1
before	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:8	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
Daniel	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods:	1
and	1
before	1
him	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
secret	1
troubleth	1
thee,	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
dream	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:10	1
Thus	1
were	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
mine	1
head	1
in	1
my	1
bed;	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
tree	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:12	1
The	1
leaves	1
thereof	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all:	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
had	1
shadow	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
was	1
fed	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
bed,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
4:14	1
He	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
and	1
said	1
thus,	1
Hew	1
down	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
branches,	1
shake	1
off	1
his	1
leaves,	1
and	1
scatter	1
his	1
fruit:	1
let	1
the	1
beasts	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
from	1
his	1
branches:	1
4:15	1
Nevertheless	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
his	1
roots	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:16	1
Let	1
his	1
heart	1
be	1
changed	1
from	1
man's,	1
and	1
let	1
a	1
beast's	1
heart	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
let	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
matter	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
watchers,	1
and	1
the	1
demand	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
ones:	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
basest	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:18	1
This	1
dream	1
I	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
have	1
seen.	1
Now	1
thou,	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
declare	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
able;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
4:19	1
Then	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
was	1
astonied	1
for	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him.	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Belteshazzar,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
dream,	1
or	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
trouble	1
thee.	1
Belteshazzar	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
the	1
dream	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
to	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:20	1
The	1
tree	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
which	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
whose	1
height	1
reached	1
unto	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
4:21	1
Whose	1
leaves	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all;	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
upon	1
whose	1
branches	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
had	1
their	1
habitation:	1
4:22	1
It	1
is	1
thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
art	1
grown	1
and	1
become	1
strong:	1
for	1
thy	1
greatness	1
is	1
grown,	1
and	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
thy	1
dominion	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
whereas	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hew	1
the	1
tree	1
down,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it;	1
yet	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
till	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him;	1
4:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation,	1
O	1
king,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
4:25	1
That	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wet	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
till	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
whereas	1
they	1
commanded	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
roots;	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
sure	1
unto	1
thee,	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
heavens	1
do	1
rule.	1
	1
4:27	1
Wherefore,	1
O	1
king,	1
let	1
my	1
counsel	1
be	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
break	1
off	1
thy	1
sins	1
by	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquities	1
by	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
lengthening	1
of	1
thy	1
tranquillity.	1
	1
4:28	1
All	1
this	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
4:29	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
twelve	1
months	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:30	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
great	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
power,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
majesty?	1
	1
4:31	1
While	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
mouth,	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
O	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
to	1
thee	1
it	1
is	1
spoken;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:33	1
The	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
fulfilled	1
upon	1
Nebuchadnezzar:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
till	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
grown	1
like	1
eagles'	1
feathers,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
like	1
birds'	1
claws.	1
	1
4:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
mine	1
understanding	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
blessed	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
I	1
praised	1
and	1
honoured	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever,	1
whose	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation:	1
4:35	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
reputed	1
as	1
nothing:	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
stay	1
his	1
hand,	1
or	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
4:36	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
my	1
reason	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
mine	1
honour	1
and	1
brightness	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
my	1
counsellors	1
and	1
my	1
lords	1
sought	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
excellent	1
majesty	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:37	1
Now	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
praise	1
and	1
extol	1
and	1
honour	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
heaven,	1
all	1
whose	1
works	1
are	1
truth,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
judgment:	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
walk	1
in	1
pride	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
abase.	1
	1
5:1	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
his	1
lords,	1
and	1
drank	1
wine	1
before	1
the	1
thousand.	1
	1
5:2	1
Belshazzar,	1
whiles	1
he	1
tasted	1
the	1
wine,	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
golden	1
and	1
silver	1
vessels	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
that	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
might	1
drink	1
therein.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
golden	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
drank	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
drank	1
wine,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
of	1
brass,	1
of	1
iron,	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
5:5	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
came	1
forth	1
fingers	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hand,	1
and	1
wrote	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
candlestick	1
upon	1
the	1
plaister	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
palace:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
wrote.	1
	1
5:6	1
Then	1
the	1
king's	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
were	1
loosed,	1
and	1
his	1
knees	1
smote	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
king	1
cried	1
aloud	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:8	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
wise	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
nor	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
was	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
greatly	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
were	1
astonied.	1
	1
5:10	1
Now	1
the	1
queen	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
banquet	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
trouble	1
thee,	1
nor	1
let	1
thy	1
countenance	1
be	1
changed:	1
5:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
like	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
gods,	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
him;	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father,	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
say,	1
thy	1
father,	1
made	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
astrologers,	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
soothsayers;	1
5:12	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding,	1
interpreting	1
of	1
dreams,	1
and	1
shewing	1
of	1
hard	1
sentences,	1
and	1
dissolving	1
of	1
doubts,	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
Daniel,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
named	1
Belteshazzar:	1
now	1
let	1
Daniel	1
be	1
called,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Then	1
was	1
Daniel	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
my	1
father	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jewry?	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
excellent	1
wisdom	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
5:16	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
interpretations,	1
and	1
dissolve	1
doubts:	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
thy	1
gifts	1
be	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
give	1
thy	1
rewards	1
to	1
another;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
the	1
writing	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:18	1
O	1
thou	1
king,	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
gave	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
majesty,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour:	1
5:19	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
majesty	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him,	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
trembled	1
and	1
feared	1
before	1
him:	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
slew;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
kept	1
alive;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
put	1
down.	1
	1
5:20	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
hardened	1
in	1
pride,	1
he	1
was	1
deposed	1
from	1
his	1
kingly	1
throne,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
glory	1
from	1
him:	1
5:21	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
made	1
like	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
his	1
dwelling	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
asses:	1
they	1
fed	1
him	1
with	1
grass	1
like	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven;	1
till	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
ruled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
appointeth	1
over	1
it	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
thou	1
his	1
son,	1
O	1
Belshazzar,	1
hast	1
not	1
humbled	1
thine	1
heart,	1
though	1
thou	1
knewest	1
all	1
this;	1
5:23	1
But	1
hast	1
lifted	1
up	1
thyself	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
lords,	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
thy	1
concubines,	1
have	1
drunk	1
wine	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
of	1
brass,	1
iron,	1
wood,	1
and	1
stone,	1
which	1
see	1
not,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
know:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
thy	1
breath	1
is,	1
and	1
whose	1
are	1
all	1
thy	1
ways,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
glorified:	1
5:24	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
sent	1
from	1
him;	1
and	1
this	1
writing	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
writing	1
that	1
was	1
written,	1
MENE,	1
MENE,	1
TEKEL,	1
UPHARSIN.	1
	1
5:26	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
MENE;	1
God	1
hath	1
numbered	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
finished	1
it.	1
	1
5:27	1
TEKEL;	1
Thou	1
art	1
weighed	1
in	1
the	1
balances,	1
and	1
art	1
found	1
wanting.	1
	1
5:28	1
PERES;	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
is	1
divided,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
commanded	1
Belshazzar,	1
and	1
they	1
clothed	1
Daniel	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:30	1
In	1
that	1
night	1
was	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
slain.	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Darius	1
the	1
Median	1
took	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
being	1
about	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
6:1	1
It	1
pleased	1
Darius	1
to	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
kingdom	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
princes,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom;	1
6:2	1
And	1
over	1
these	1
three	1
presidents;	1
of	1
whom	1
Daniel	1
was	1
first:	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
might	1
give	1
accounts	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
damage.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
this	1
Daniel	1
was	1
preferred	1
above	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes,	1
because	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit	1
was	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thought	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
realm.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
sought	1
to	1
find	1
occasion	1
against	1
Daniel	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
none	1
occasion	1
nor	1
fault;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
faithful,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
error	1
or	1
fault	1
found	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
said	1
these	1
men,	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
any	1
occasion	1
against	1
this	1
Daniel,	1
except	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
against	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:6	1
Then	1
these	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
assembled	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
King	1
Darius,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:7	1
All	1
the	1
presidents	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
have	1
consulted	1
together	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
royal	1
statute,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
decree,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
for	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now,	1
O	1
king,	1
establish	1
the	1
decree,	1
and	1
sign	1
the	1
writing,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
changed,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:9	1
Wherefore	1
king	1
Darius	1
signed	1
the	1
writing	1
and	1
the	1
decree.	1
	1
6:10	1
Now	1
when	1
Daniel	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
signed,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
his	1
windows	1
being	1
open	1
in	1
his	1
chamber	1
toward	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
before	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
aforetime.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled,	1
and	1
found	1
Daniel	1
praying	1
and	1
making	1
supplication	1
before	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
concerning	1
the	1
king's	1
decree;	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
signed	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
within	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions?	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
true,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:13	1
Then	1
answered	1
they	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
That	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
regardeth	1
not	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
nor	1
the	1
decree	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
signed,	1
but	1
maketh	1
his	1
petition	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
the	1
king,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
was	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
on	1
Daniel	1
to	1
deliver	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
laboured	1
till	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
deliver	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Know,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians	1
is,	1
That	1
no	1
decree	1
nor	1
statute	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
establisheth	1
may	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
6:16	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Thy	1
God	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
brought,	1
and	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
den;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sealed	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
signet,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
signet	1
of	1
his	1
lords;	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
concerning	1
Daniel.	1
	1
6:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
palace,	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
fasting:	1
neither	1
were	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick	1
brought	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
went	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
6:19	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
den,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
lamentable	1
voice	1
unto	1
Daniel:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
is	1
thy	1
God,	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
lions?	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:22	1
My	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
the	1
lions'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hurt	1
me:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
before	1
him	1
innocency	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
me;	1
and	1
also	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
hurt.	1
	1
6:23	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
Daniel	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
So	1
Daniel	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den,	1
and	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
hurt	1
was	1
found	1
upon	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
accused	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions,	1
them,	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
wives;	1
and	1
the	1
lions	1
had	1
the	1
mastery	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
brake	1
all	1
their	1
bones	1
in	1
pieces	1
or	1
ever	1
they	1
came	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
	1
6:25	1
Then	1
king	1
Darius	1
wrote	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:26	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
dominion	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
men	1
tremble	1
and	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
stedfast	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
6:27	1
He	1
delivereth	1
and	1
rescueth,	1
and	1
he	1
worketh	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Daniel	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
lions.	1
	1
6:28	1
So	1
this	1
Daniel	1
prospered	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
Persian.	1
	1
7:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Belshazzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
Daniel	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
visions	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
upon	1
his	1
bed:	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
matters.	1
	1
7:2	1
Daniel	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
vision	1
by	1
night,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
strove	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
sea.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
four	1
great	1
beasts	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
diverse	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
had	1
eagle's	1
wings:	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
wings	1
thereof	1
were	1
plucked,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
made	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
feet	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
heart	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
behold	1
another	1
beast,	1
a	1
second,	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
it	1
raised	1
up	1
itself	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
three	1
ribs	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
it,	1
Arise,	1
devour	1
much	1
flesh.	1
	1
7:6	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
another,	1
like	1
a	1
leopard,	1
which	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
four	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
fowl;	1
the	1
beast	1
had	1
also	1
four	1
heads;	1
and	1
dominion	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:7	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
dreadful	1
and	1
terrible,	1
and	1
strong	1
exceedingly;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
great	1
iron	1
teeth:	1
it	1
devoured	1
and	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
horns,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
among	1
them	1
another	1
little	1
horn,	1
before	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
horns	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
in	1
this	1
horn	1
were	1
eyes	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
thrones	1
were	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
did	1
sit,	1
whose	1
garment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
snow,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
pure	1
wool:	1
his	1
throne	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
fiery	1
flame,	1
and	1
his	1
wheels	1
as	1
burning	1
fire.	1
	1
7:10	1
A	1
fiery	1
stream	1
issued	1
and	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
thousand	1
thousands	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
set,	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened.	1
	1
7:11	1
I	1
beheld	1
then	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
horn	1
spake:	1
I	1
beheld	1
even	1
till	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
slain,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
burning	1
flame.	1
	1
7:12	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
dominion	1
taken	1
away:	1
yet	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
prolonged	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
and	1
time.	1
	1
7:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
near	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
dominion,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
should	1
serve	1
him:	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
7:15	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
grieved	1
in	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
So	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
know	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
things.	1
	1
7:17	1
These	1
great	1
beasts,	1
which	1
are	1
four,	1
are	1
four	1
kings,	1
which	1
shall	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:18	1
But	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
7:19	1
Then	1
I	1
would	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
which	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
others,	1
exceeding	1
dreadful,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
were	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
of	1
brass;	1
which	1
devoured,	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
his	1
feet;	1
7:20	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
before	1
whom	1
three	1
fell;	1
even	1
of	1
that	1
horn	1
that	1
had	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
that	1
spake	1
very	1
great	1
things,	1
whose	1
look	1
was	1
more	1
stout	1
than	1
his	1
fellows.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
horn	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them;	1
7:22	1
Until	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
came,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
possessed	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:23	1
Thus	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
fourth	1
beast	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
earth,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
shall	1
tread	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
break	1
it	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
kingdom	1
are	1
ten	1
kings	1
that	1
shall	1
arise:	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
rise	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
subdue	1
three	1
kings.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
great	1
words	1
against	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
shall	1
wear	1
out	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
change	1
times	1
and	1
laws:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
until	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
dividing	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
the	1
judgment	1
shall	1
sit,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
dominion,	1
to	1
consume	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
whose	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
all	1
dominions	1
shall	1
serve	1
and	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
7:28	1
Hitherto	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
As	1
for	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
my	1
cogitations	1
much	1
troubled	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
countenance	1
changed	1
in	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
kept	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
unto	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
saw,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Shushan	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Elam;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Ulai.	1
	1
8:3	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
river	1
a	1
ram	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
horns	1
were	1
high;	1
but	1
one	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
higher	1
came	1
up	1
last.	1
	1
8:4	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
ram	1
pushing	1
westward,	1
and	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward;	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
beasts	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
became	1
great.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
considering,	1
behold,	1
an	1
he	1
goat	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
touched	1
not	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
goat	1
had	1
a	1
notable	1
horn	1
between	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
that	1
had	1
two	1
horns,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
close	1
unto	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
choler	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
brake	1
his	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
ram	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
the	1
ram	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
8:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
he	1
goat	1
waxed	1
very	1
great:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
strong,	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
was	1
broken;	1
and	1
for	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
four	1
notable	1
ones	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
horn,	1
which	1
waxed	1
exceeding	1
great,	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
it	1
waxed	1
great,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
8:11	1
Yea,	1
he	1
magnified	1
himself	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
was	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
was	1
cast	1
down.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
an	1
host	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
transgression,	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
it	1
practised,	1
and	1
prospered.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
I	1
heard	1
one	1
saint	1
speaking,	1
and	1
another	1
saint	1
said	1
unto	1
that	1
certain	1
saint	1
which	1
spake,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision	1
concerning	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
desolation,	1
to	1
give	1
both	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot?	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Unto	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
days;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
be	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
Daniel,	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
meaning,	1
then,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
man's	1
voice	1
between	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
Ulai,	1
which	1
called,	1
and	1
said,	1
Gabriel,	1
make	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:17	1
So	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
where	1
I	1
stood:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face:	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Understand,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground:	1
but	1
he	1
touched	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upright.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
know	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
indignation:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
8:20	1
The	1
ram	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
having	1
two	1
horns	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Media	1
and	1
Persia.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
rough	1
goat	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Grecia:	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
that	1
is	1
between	1
his	1
eyes	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
king.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
that	1
being	1
broken,	1
whereas	1
four	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
it,	1
four	1
kingdoms	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
kingdom,	1
when	1
the	1
transgressors	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
fierce	1
countenance,	1
and	1
understanding	1
dark	1
sentences,	1
shall	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
his	1
power	1
shall	1
be	1
mighty,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
wonderfully,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
and	1
practise,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
mighty	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
people.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
through	1
his	1
policy	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
craft	1
to	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
by	1
peace	1
shall	1
destroy	1
many:	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
princes;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
without	1
hand.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
is	1
true:	1
wherefore	1
shut	1
thou	1
up	1
the	1
vision;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
fainted,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
certain	1
days;	1
afterward	1
I	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
king's	1
business;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
vision,	1
but	1
none	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
9:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
9:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
I	1
Daniel	1
understood	1
by	1
books	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
whereof	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
accomplish	1
seventy	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
desolations	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
God,	1
to	1
seek	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplications,	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
ashes:	1
9:4	1
And	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
confession,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
God,	1
keeping	1
the	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments;	1
9:5	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
have	1
committed	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly,	1
and	1
have	1
rebelled,	1
even	1
by	1
departing	1
from	1
thy	1
precepts	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
9:6	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
spake	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
righteousness	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
confusion	1
of	1
faces,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
that	1
are	1
near,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
countries	1
whither	1
thou	1
hast	1
driven	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
trespass	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
trespassed	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:8	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
us	1
belongeth	1
confusion	1
of	1
face,	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
to	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:9	1
To	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
belong	1
mercies	1
and	1
forgivenesses,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
him;	1
9:10	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
laws,	1
which	1
he	1
set	1
before	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
9:11	1
Yea,	1
all	1
Israel	1
have	1
transgressed	1
thy	1
law,	1
even	1
by	1
departing,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
obey	1
thy	1
voice;	1
therefore	1
the	1
curse	1
is	1
poured	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
confirmed	1
his	1
words,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
against	1
our	1
judges	1
that	1
judged	1
us,	1
by	1
bringing	1
upon	1
us	1
a	1
great	1
evil:	1
for	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
as	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us:	1
yet	1
made	1
we	1
not	1
our	1
prayer	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
turn	1
from	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
understand	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
9:14	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
watched	1
upon	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
righteous	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
which	1
he	1
doeth:	1
for	1
we	1
obeyed	1
not	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Lord	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
hast	1
brought	1
thy	1
people	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
hast	1
gotten	1
thee	1
renown,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
we	1
have	1
sinned,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly.	1
	1
9:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
thine	1
anger	1
and	1
thy	1
fury	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
city	1
Jerusalem,	1
thy	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
because	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
become	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
9:17	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
our	1
God,	1
hear	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
his	1
supplications,	1
and	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
sanctuary	1
that	1
is	1
desolate,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:18	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold	1
our	1
desolations,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name:	1
for	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
our	1
supplications	1
before	1
thee	1
for	1
our	1
righteousnesses,	1
but	1
for	1
thy	1
great	1
mercies.	1
	1
9:19	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hear;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
forgive;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hearken	1
and	1
do;	1
defer	1
not,	1
for	1
thine	1
own	1
sake,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
thy	1
city	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking,	1
and	1
praying,	1
and	1
confessing	1
my	1
sin	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
presenting	1
my	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain	1
of	1
my	1
God;	1
9:21	1
Yea,	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
prayer,	1
even	1
the	1
man	1
Gabriel,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
vision	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
being	1
caused	1
to	1
fly	1
swiftly,	1
touched	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
oblation.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
he	1
informed	1
me,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
skill	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
9:23	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
thy	1
supplications	1
the	1
commandment	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
shew	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
beloved:	1
therefore	1
understand	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
9:24	1
Seventy	1
weeks	1
are	1
determined	1
upon	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
holy	1
city,	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
everlasting	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
to	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
vision	1
and	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
to	1
anoint	1
the	1
most	1
Holy.	1
	1
9:25	1
Know	1
therefore	1
and	1
understand,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
going	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
to	1
restore	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Messiah	1
the	1
Prince	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
weeks,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks:	1
the	1
street	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
wall,	1
even	1
in	1
troublous	1
times.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
after	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks	1
shall	1
Messiah	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
himself:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuary;	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
flood,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
desolations	1
are	1
determined.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
confirm	1
the	1
covenant	1
with	1
many	1
for	1
one	1
week:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
the	1
oblation	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
overspreading	1
of	1
abominations	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
desolate,	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
consummation,	1
and	1
that	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
desolate.	1
	1
10:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia	1
a	1
thing	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
true,	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
was	1
long:	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
thing,	1
and	1
had	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
10:2	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
mourning	1
three	1
full	1
weeks.	1
	1
10:3	1
I	1
ate	1
no	1
pleasant	1
bread,	1
neither	1
came	1
flesh	1
nor	1
wine	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
anoint	1
myself	1
at	1
all,	1
till	1
three	1
whole	1
weeks	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
which	1
is	1
Hiddekel;	1
10:5	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
whose	1
loins	1
were	1
girded	1
with	1
fine	1
gold	1
of	1
Uphaz:	1
10:6	1
His	1
body	1
also	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
beryl,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
in	1
colour	1
to	1
polished	1
brass,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
like	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
multitude.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
alone	1
saw	1
the	1
vision:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
quaking	1
fell	1
upon	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
to	1
hide	1
themselves.	1
	1
10:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
saw	1
this	1
great	1
vision,	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me:	1
for	1
my	1
comeliness	1
was	1
turned	1
in	1
me	1
into	1
corruption,	1
and	1
I	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:9	1
Yet	1
heard	1
I	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
then	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
10:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
an	1
hand	1
touched	1
me,	1
which	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
a	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
stand	1
upright:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
sent.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
stood	1
trembling.	1
	1
10:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
understand,	1
and	1
to	1
chasten	1
thyself	1
before	1
thy	1
God,	1
thy	1
words	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
for	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Persia	1
withstood	1
me	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
days:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
Michael,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
princes,	1
came	1
to	1
help	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
10:14	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
understand	1
what	1
shall	1
befall	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
words	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
dumb.	1
	1
10:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
touched	1
my	1
lips:	1
then	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
by	1
the	1
vision	1
my	1
sorrows	1
are	1
turned	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
this	1
my	1
lord	1
talk	1
with	1
this	1
my	1
lord?	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
straightway	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
breath	1
left	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
10:18	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
touched	1
me	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
strengthened	1
me,	1
10:19	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
fear	1
not:	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee,	1
be	1
strong,	1
yea,	1
be	1
strong.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
strengthened,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
speak;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
strengthened	1
me.	1
	1
10:20	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
wherefore	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Persia:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
forth,	1
lo,	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Grecia	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
noted	1
in	1
the	1
scripture	1
of	1
truth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
holdeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
Michael	1
your	1
prince.	1
	1
11:1	1
Also	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
Mede,	1
even	1
I,	1
stood	1
to	1
confirm	1
and	1
to	1
strengthen	1
him.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
truth.	1
Behold,	1
there	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
yet	1
three	1
kings	1
in	1
Persia;	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
richer	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
through	1
his	1
riches	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
all	1
against	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
Grecia.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
king	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
with	1
great	1
dominion,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
posterity,	1
nor	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
dominion	1
which	1
he	1
ruled:	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
plucked	1
up,	1
even	1
for	1
others	1
beside	1
those.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
princes;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
above	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
dominion;	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
dominion.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
years	1
they	1
shall	1
join	1
themselves	1
together;	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
agreement:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
retain	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
arm;	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand,	1
nor	1
his	1
arm:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
brought	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
begat	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
strengthened	1
her	1
in	1
these	1
times.	1
	1
11:7	1
But	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
her	1
roots	1
shall	1
one	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
shall	1
deal	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
prevail:	1
11:8	1
And	1
shall	1
also	1
carry	1
captives	1
into	1
Egypt	1
their	1
gods,	1
with	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
precious	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
gold;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
continue	1
more	1
years	1
than	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
11:9	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
assemble	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
great	1
forces:	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come,	1
and	1
overflow,	1
and	1
pass	1
through:	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
fortress.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
with	1
choler,	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
great	1
multitude;	1
but	1
the	1
multitude	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cast	1
down	1
many	1
ten	1
thousands:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
multitude	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
after	1
certain	1
years	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
riches.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
times	1
there	1
shall	1
many	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
also	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
exalt	1
themselves	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
11:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
cast	1
up	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
most	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
not	1
withstand,	1
neither	1
his	1
chosen	1
people,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
strength	1
to	1
withstand.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
which	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
11:17	1
He	1
shall	1
also	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
enter	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
upright	1
ones	1
with	1
him;	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
women,	1
corrupting	1
her:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
neither	1
be	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
11:18	1
After	1
this	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
isles,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
many:	1
but	1
a	1
prince	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
behalf	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
reproach	1
offered	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
cease;	1
without	1
his	1
own	1
reproach	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:19	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
fort	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
land:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
stumble	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
a	1
raiser	1
of	1
taxes	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
within	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
neither	1
in	1
anger,	1
nor	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
a	1
vile	1
person,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
peaceably,	1
and	1
obtain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
a	1
flood	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
overflown	1
from	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
yea,	1
also	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
league	1
made	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
shall	1
work	1
deceitfully:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
become	1
strong	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
people.	1
	1
11:24	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
peaceably	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
fattest	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
province;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
fathers	1
have	1
not	1
done,	1
nor	1
his	1
fathers'	1
fathers;	1
he	1
shall	1
scatter	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
spoil,	1
and	1
riches:	1
yea,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
forecast	1
his	1
devices	1
against	1
the	1
strong	1
holds,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
courage	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
army;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
forecast	1
devices	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
11:26	1
Yea,	1
they	1
that	1
feed	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
meat	1
shall	1
destroy	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
shall	1
overflow:	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
slain.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
kings'	1
hearts	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
do	1
mischief,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
lies	1
at	1
one	1
table;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:28	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
land	1
with	1
great	1
riches;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
exploits,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:29	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
he	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
toward	1
the	1
south;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
former,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Chittim	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
grieved,	1
and	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant:	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
intelligence	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
arms	1
shall	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pollute	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
strength,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
place	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
such	1
as	1
do	1
wickedly	1
against	1
the	1
covenant	1
shall	1
he	1
corrupt	1
by	1
flatteries:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
do	1
know	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
do	1
exploits.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
understand	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
instruct	1
many:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
flame,	1
by	1
captivity,	1
and	1
by	1
spoil,	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
11:34	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
holpen	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
help:	1
but	1
many	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
fall,	1
to	1
try	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
purge,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
white,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
and	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
every	1
god,	1
and	1
shall	1
speak	1
marvellous	1
things	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper	1
till	1
the	1
indignation	1
be	1
accomplished:	1
for	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
11:37	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
regard	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
women,	1
nor	1
regard	1
any	1
god:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
11:38	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
forces:	1
and	1
a	1
god	1
whom	1
his	1
fathers	1
knew	1
not	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
with	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
things.	1
	1
11:39	1
Thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
strong	1
holds	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
god,	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
and	1
increase	1
with	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
many,	1
and	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
gain.	1
	1
11:40	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
push	1
at	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
with	1
chariots,	1
and	1
with	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
ships;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
countries,	1
and	1
shall	1
overflow	1
and	1
pass	1
over.	1
	1
11:41	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
and	1
many	1
countries	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown:	1
but	1
these	1
shall	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
even	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:42	1
He	1
shall	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
countries:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
11:43	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
Libyans	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
11:44	1
But	1
tidings	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
trouble	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
great	1
fury	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
utterly	1
to	1
make	1
away	1
many.	1
	1
11:45	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
plant	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
his	1
palace	1
between	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
holy	1
mountain;	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
end,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
Michael	1
stand	1
up,	1
the	1
great	1
prince	1
which	1
standeth	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
was	1
since	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nation	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
same	1
time:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
awake,	1
some	1
to	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
everlasting	1
contempt.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
wise	1
shall	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
firmament;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
turn	1
many	1
to	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
12:4	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
words,	1
and	1
seal	1
the	1
book,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
many	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
be	1
increased.	1
	1
12:5	1
Then	1
I	1
Daniel	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
other	1
two,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
wonders?	1
12:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
when	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
times,	1
and	1
an	1
half;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
accomplished	1
to	1
scatter	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
people,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
finished.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
I	1
heard,	1
but	1
I	1
understood	1
not:	1
then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
closed	1
up	1
and	1
sealed	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
12:10	1
Many	1
shall	1
be	1
purified,	1
and	1
made	1
white,	1
and	1
tried;	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
do	1
wickedly:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
understand;	1
but	1
the	1
wise	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate	1
set	1
up,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
days.	1
	1
12:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
waiteth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
and	1
thirty	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
But	1
go	1
thou	1
thy	1
way	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
be:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest,	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
thy	1
lot	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Hosea	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
Hosea,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beeri,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Hosea.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Hosea,	1
Go,	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
hath	1
committed	1
great	1
whoredom,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
Gomer	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Diblaim;	1
which	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Jezreel;	1
for	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jezreel	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
daughter.	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
her	1
name	1
Loruhamah:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
take	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
bow,	1
nor	1
by	1
sword,	1
nor	1
by	1
battle,	1
by	1
horses,	1
nor	1
by	1
horsemen.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
weaned	1
Loruhamah,	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
God,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Loammi:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:10	1
Yet	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
measured	1
nor	1
numbered;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
appoint	1
themselves	1
one	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:1	1
Say	1
ye	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren,	1
Ammi;	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
sisters,	1
Ruhamah.	1
	1
2:2	1
Plead	1
with	1
your	1
mother,	1
plead:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
wife,	1
neither	1
am	1
I	1
her	1
husband:	1
let	1
her	1
therefore	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
sight,	1
and	1
her	1
adulteries	1
from	1
between	1
her	1
breasts;	1
2:3	1
Lest	1
I	1
strip	1
her	1
naked,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
slay	1
her	1
with	1
thirst.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
children;	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
their	1
mother	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot:	1
she	1
that	1
conceived	1
them	1
hath	1
done	1
shamefully:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
after	1
my	1
lovers,	1
that	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
bread	1
and	1
my	1
water,	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax,	1
mine	1
oil	1
and	1
my	1
drink.	1
	1
2:6	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
hedge	1
up	1
thy	1
way	1
with	1
thorns,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
wall,	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
paths.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
follow	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
seek	1
them,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
them:	1
then	1
shall	1
she	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
husband;	1
for	1
then	1
was	1
it	1
better	1
with	1
me	1
than	1
now.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
her	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
which	1
they	1
prepared	1
for	1
Baal.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
return,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
thereof,	1
and	1
my	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
recover	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax	1
given	1
to	1
cover	1
her	1
nakedness.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
discover	1
her	1
lewdness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
deliver	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
2:11	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cause	1
all	1
her	1
mirth	1
to	1
cease,	1
her	1
feast	1
days,	1
her	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
solemn	1
feasts.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
her	1
vines	1
and	1
her	1
fig	1
trees,	1
whereof	1
she	1
hath	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
my	1
rewards	1
that	1
my	1
lovers	1
have	1
given	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
eat	1
them.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Baalim,	1
wherein	1
she	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
decked	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
earrings	1
and	1
her	1
jewels,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
forgat	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
allure	1
her,	1
and	1
bring	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
speak	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
her	1
vineyards	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor	1
for	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
hope:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
sing	1
there,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
youth,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
Ishi;	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
no	1
more	1
Baali.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Baalim	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered	1
by	1
their	1
name.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
creeping	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
safely.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
ever;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
lovingkindness,	1
and	1
in	1
mercies.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
faithfulness:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
I	1
will	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
her	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
yet,	1
love	1
a	1
woman	1
beloved	1
of	1
her	1
friend,	1
yet	1
an	1
adulteress,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
toward	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
look	1
to	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
love	1
flagons	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
3:2	1
So	1
I	1
bought	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
fifteen	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
homer	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
homer	1
of	1
barley:	1
3:3	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
abide	1
for	1
me	1
many	1
days;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
another	1
man:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
be	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
abide	1
many	1
days	1
without	1
a	1
king,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
prince,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
image,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
without	1
teraphim:	1
3:5	1
Afterward	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
return,	1
and	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
David	1
their	1
king;	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
his	1
goodness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth,	1
nor	1
mercy,	1
nor	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
By	1
swearing,	1
and	1
lying,	1
and	1
killing,	1
and	1
stealing,	1
and	1
committing	1
adultery,	1
they	1
break	1
out,	1
and	1
blood	1
toucheth	1
blood.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
mourn,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein	1
shall	1
languish,	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven;	1
yea,	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
4:4	1
Yet	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
strive,	1
nor	1
reprove	1
another:	1
for	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
4:6	1
My	1
people	1
are	1
destroyed	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
knowledge,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
reject	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
no	1
priest	1
to	1
me:	1
seeing	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
forget	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
4:7	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
increased,	1
so	1
they	1
sinned	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
change	1
their	1
glory	1
into	1
shame.	1
	1
4:8	1
They	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
their	1
heart	1
on	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be,	1
like	1
people,	1
like	1
priest:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
ways,	1
and	1
reward	1
them	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
enough:	1
they	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
increase:	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
Whoredom	1
and	1
wine	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:12	1
My	1
people	1
ask	1
counsel	1
at	1
their	1
stocks,	1
and	1
their	1
staff	1
declareth	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
hath	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
hills,	1
under	1
oaks	1
and	1
poplars	1
and	1
elms,	1
because	1
the	1
shadow	1
thereof	1
is	1
good:	1
therefore	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
your	1
spouses	1
shall	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
punish	1
your	1
daughters	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
nor	1
your	1
spouses	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
for	1
themselves	1
are	1
separated	1
with	1
whores,	1
and	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
harlots:	1
therefore	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
doth	1
not	1
understand	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
4:15	1
Though	1
thou,	1
Israel,	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
yet	1
let	1
not	1
Judah	1
offend;	1
and	1
come	1
not	1
ye	1
unto	1
Gilgal,	1
neither	1
go	1
ye	1
up	1
to	1
Bethaven,	1
nor	1
swear,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
Israel	1
slideth	1
back	1
as	1
a	1
backsliding	1
heifer:	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
place.	1
	1
4:17	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
idols:	1
let	1
him	1
alone.	1
	1
4:18	1
Their	1
drink	1
is	1
sour:	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
whoredom	1
continually:	1
her	1
rulers	1
with	1
shame	1
do	1
love,	1
Give	1
ye.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
wind	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this,	1
O	1
priests;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
give	1
ye	1
ear,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
judgment	1
is	1
toward	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
snare	1
on	1
Mizpah,	1
and	1
a	1
net	1
spread	1
upon	1
Tabor.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
the	1
revolters	1
are	1
profound	1
to	1
make	1
slaughter,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
rebuker	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
5:3	1
I	1
know	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
me:	1
for	1
now,	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
thou	1
committest	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
will	1
not	1
frame	1
their	1
doings	1
to	1
turn	1
unto	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
doth	1
testify	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
Israel	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
fall	1
in	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:6	1
They	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
herds	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him;	1
he	1
hath	1
withdrawn	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
5:7	1
They	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
begotten	1
strange	1
children:	1
now	1
shall	1
a	1
month	1
devour	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
portions.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Ramah:	1
cry	1
aloud	1
at	1
Bethaven,	1
after	1
thee,	1
O	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
5:9	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
rebuke:	1
among	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
known	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
surely	1
be.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
like	1
them	1
that	1
remove	1
the	1
bound:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
wrath	1
upon	1
them	1
like	1
water.	1
	1
5:11	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
oppressed	1
and	1
broken	1
in	1
judgment,	1
because	1
he	1
willingly	1
walked	1
after	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
5:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
moth,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
as	1
rottenness.	1
	1
5:13	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
saw	1
his	1
sickness,	1
and	1
Judah	1
saw	1
his	1
wound,	1
then	1
went	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
yet	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
heal	1
you,	1
nor	1
cure	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
wound.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
tear	1
and	1
go	1
away;	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
rescue	1
him.	1
	1
5:15	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
place,	1
till	1
they	1
acknowledge	1
their	1
offence,	1
and	1
seek	1
my	1
face:	1
in	1
their	1
affliction	1
they	1
will	1
seek	1
me	1
early.	1
	1
6:1	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
torn,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
heal	1
us;	1
he	1
hath	1
smitten,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
bind	1
us	1
up.	1
	1
6:2	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
will	1
he	1
revive	1
us:	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
will	1
raise	1
us	1
up,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
we	1
know,	1
if	1
we	1
follow	1
on	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
LORD:	1
his	1
going	1
forth	1
is	1
prepared	1
as	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
the	1
rain,	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
former	1
rain	1
unto	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
O	1
Judah,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
for	1
your	1
goodness	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
morning	1
cloud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
it	1
goeth	1
away.	1
	1
6:5	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hewed	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
prophets;	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth:	1
and	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
6:6	1
For	1
I	1
desired	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice;	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
than	1
burnt	1
offerings.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
they	1
like	1
men	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
covenant:	1
there	1
have	1
they	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:8	1
Gilead	1
is	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
is	1
polluted	1
with	1
blood.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
as	1
troops	1
of	1
robbers	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
priests	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
consent:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
lewdness.	1
	1
6:10	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
horrible	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
whoredom	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
6:11	1
Also,	1
O	1
Judah,	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
an	1
harvest	1
for	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
When	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
healed	1
Israel,	1
then	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
falsehood;	1
and	1
the	1
thief	1
cometh	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
troop	1
of	1
robbers	1
spoileth	1
without.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
they	1
consider	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
I	1
remember	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness:	1
now	1
their	1
own	1
doings	1
have	1
beset	1
them	1
about;	1
they	1
are	1
before	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
7:3	1
They	1
make	1
the	1
king	1
glad	1
with	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
with	1
their	1
lies.	1
	1
7:4	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
adulterers,	1
as	1
an	1
oven	1
heated	1
by	1
the	1
baker,	1
who	1
ceaseth	1
from	1
raising	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
kneaded	1
the	1
dough,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
leavened.	1
	1
7:5	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
king	1
the	1
princes	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
sick	1
with	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine;	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
scorners.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
ready	1
their	1
heart	1
like	1
an	1
oven,	1
whiles	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait:	1
their	1
baker	1
sleepeth	1
all	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
burneth	1
as	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire.	1
	1
7:7	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
hot	1
as	1
an	1
oven,	1
and	1
have	1
devoured	1
their	1
judges;	1
all	1
their	1
kings	1
are	1
fallen:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
calleth	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Ephraim,	1
he	1
hath	1
mixed	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
a	1
cake	1
not	1
turned.	1
	1
7:9	1
Strangers	1
have	1
devoured	1
his	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not:	1
yea,	1
gray	1
hairs	1
are	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
upon	1
him,	1
yet	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
testifieth	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
nor	1
seek	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
7:11	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
silly	1
dove	1
without	1
heart:	1
they	1
call	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:12	1
When	1
they	1
shall	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
my	1
net	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven;	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
them,	1
as	1
their	1
congregation	1
hath	1
heard.	1
	1
7:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
me:	1
destruction	1
unto	1
them!	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
cried	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
when	1
they	1
howled	1
upon	1
their	1
beds:	1
they	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
for	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
they	1
rebel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:15	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
bound	1
and	1
strengthened	1
their	1
arms,	1
yet	1
do	1
they	1
imagine	1
mischief	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
return,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High:	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
deceitful	1
bow:	1
their	1
princes	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
for	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
their	1
tongue:	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
derision	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:1	1
Set	1
the	1
trumpet	1
to	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
as	1
an	1
eagle	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
trespassed	1
against	1
my	1
law.	1
	1
8:2	1
Israel	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
God,	1
we	1
know	1
thee.	1
	1
8:3	1
Israel	1
hath	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
good:	1
the	1
enemy	1
shall	1
pursue	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
They	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
kings,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
princes,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not:	1
of	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
have	1
they	1
made	1
them	1
idols,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
8:5	1
Thy	1
calf,	1
O	1
Samaria,	1
hath	1
cast	1
thee	1
off;	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
kindled	1
against	1
them:	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
they	1
attain	1
to	1
innocency?	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
from	1
Israel	1
was	1
it	1
also:	1
the	1
workman	1
made	1
it;	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
sown	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1
stalk;	1
the	1
bud	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meal:	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
yield,	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
swallow	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
Israel	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up:	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Assyria,	1
a	1
wild	1
ass	1
alone	1
by	1
himself:	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
hired	1
lovers.	1
	1
8:10	1
Yea,	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
hired	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sorrow	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
princes.	1
	1
8:11	1
Because	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
made	1
many	1
altars	1
to	1
sin,	1
altars	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
8:12	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
law,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
as	1
a	1
strange	1
thing.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
mine	1
offerings,	1
and	1
eat	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
accepteth	1
them	1
not;	1
now	1
will	1
he	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
visit	1
their	1
sins:	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
Israel	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
his	1
Maker,	1
and	1
buildeth	1
temples;	1
and	1
Judah	1
hath	1
multiplied	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
9:1	1
Rejoice	1
not,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
for	1
joy,	1
as	1
other	1
people:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
a	1
reward	1
upon	1
every	1
cornfloor.	1
	1
9:2	1
The	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
winepress	1
shall	1
not	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
shall	1
fail	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
9:3	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
land;	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
unclean	1
things	1
in	1
Assyria.	1
	1
9:4	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
wine	1
offerings	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
him:	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
mourners;	1
all	1
that	1
eat	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
polluted:	1
for	1
their	1
bread	1
for	1
their	1
soul	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:5	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
day,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
9:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
because	1
of	1
destruction:	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
up,	1
Memphis	1
shall	1
bury	1
them:	1
the	1
pleasant	1
places	1
for	1
their	1
silver,	1
nettles	1
shall	1
possess	1
them:	1
thorns	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
9:7	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
visitation	1
are	1
come,	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
recompence	1
are	1
come;	1
Israel	1
shall	1
know	1
it:	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
fool,	1
the	1
spiritual	1
man	1
is	1
mad,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
hatred.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
watchman	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
snare	1
of	1
a	1
fowler	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
9:9	1
They	1
have	1
deeply	1
corrupted	1
themselves,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
9:10	1
I	1
found	1
Israel	1
like	1
grapes	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
I	1
saw	1
your	1
fathers	1
as	1
the	1
firstripe	1
in	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
time:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Baalpeor,	1
and	1
separated	1
themselves	1
unto	1
that	1
shame;	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
were	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
loved.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
Ephraim,	1
their	1
glory	1
shall	1
fly	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
bird,	1
from	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
conception.	1
	1
9:12	1
Though	1
they	1
bring	1
up	1
their	1
children,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
bereave	1
them,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
left:	1
yea,	1
woe	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
I	1
depart	1
from	1
them!	1
	1
9:13	1
Ephraim,	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
Tyrus,	1
is	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
place:	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
his	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
murderer.	1
	1
9:14	1
Give	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give?	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
miscarrying	1
womb	1
and	1
dry	1
breasts.	1
	1
9:15	1
All	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
in	1
Gilgal:	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
hated	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
doings	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
no	1
more:	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
are	1
revolters.	1
	1
9:16	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
smitten,	1
their	1
root	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit:	1
yea,	1
though	1
they	1
bring	1
forth,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
slay	1
even	1
the	1
beloved	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
womb.	1
	1
9:17	1
My	1
God	1
will	1
cast	1
them	1
away,	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
wanderers	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
10:1	1
Israel	1
is	1
an	1
empty	1
vine,	1
he	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
himself:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
fruit	1
he	1
hath	1
increased	1
the	1
altars;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
goodly	1
images.	1
	1
10:2	1
Their	1
heart	1
is	1
divided;	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
found	1
faulty:	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
altars,	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
their	1
images.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
now	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king,	1
because	1
we	1
feared	1
not	1
the	1
LORD;	1
what	1
then	1
should	1
a	1
king	1
do	1
to	1
us?	1
	1
10:4	1
They	1
have	1
spoken	1
words,	1
swearing	1
falsely	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
covenant:	1
thus	1
judgment	1
springeth	1
up	1
as	1
hemlock	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:5	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
Bethaven:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
thereof	1
shall	1
mourn	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
that	1
rejoiced	1
on	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
thereof,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
10:6	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
carried	1
unto	1
Assyria	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
receive	1
shame,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
counsel.	1
	1
10:7	1
As	1
for	1
Samaria,	1
her	1
king	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
the	1
foam	1
upon	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
10:8	1
The	1
high	1
places	1
also	1
of	1
Aven,	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
the	1
thorn	1
and	1
the	1
thistle	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
their	1
altars;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Cover	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
10:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
sinned	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
there	1
they	1
stood:	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
iniquity	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
them.	1
	1
10:10	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
chastise	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
against	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
bind	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
two	1
furrows.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
heifer	1
that	1
is	1
taught,	1
and	1
loveth	1
to	1
tread	1
out	1
the	1
corn;	1
but	1
I	1
passed	1
over	1
upon	1
her	1
fair	1
neck:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
ride;	1
Judah	1
shall	1
plow,	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
break	1
his	1
clods.	1
	1
10:12	1
Sow	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
reap	1
in	1
mercy;	1
break	1
up	1
your	1
fallow	1
ground:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
till	1
he	1
come	1
and	1
rain	1
righteousness	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
10:13	1
Ye	1
have	1
plowed	1
wickedness,	1
ye	1
have	1
reaped	1
iniquity;	1
ye	1
have	1
eaten	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
lies:	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
trust	1
in	1
thy	1
way,	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
10:14	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
a	1
tumult	1
arise	1
among	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
fortresses	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled,	1
as	1
Shalman	1
spoiled	1
Betharbel	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle:	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
upon	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
10:15	1
So	1
shall	1
Bethel	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
wickedness:	1
in	1
a	1
morning	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
utterly	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:1	1
When	1
Israel	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
then	1
I	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
my	1
son	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
11:2	1
As	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
from	1
them:	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
11:3	1
I	1
taught	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
to	1
go,	1
taking	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
arms;	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
I	1
drew	1
them	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
with	1
bands	1
of	1
love:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
yoke	1
on	1
their	1
jaws,	1
and	1
I	1
laid	1
meat	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
11:5	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
king,	1
because	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
abide	1
on	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
his	1
branches,	1
and	1
devour	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
counsels.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
bent	1
to	1
backsliding	1
from	1
me:	1
though	1
they	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
none	1
at	1
all	1
would	1
exalt	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
up,	1
Ephraim?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
Israel?	1
	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
Admah?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
Zeboim?	1
mine	1
heart	1
is	1
turned	1
within	1
me,	1
my	1
repentings	1
are	1
kindled	1
together.	1
	1
11:9	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
execute	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
mine	1
anger,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
destroy	1
Ephraim:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
man;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:10	1
They	1
shall	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
roar,	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
tremble	1
from	1
the	1
west.	1
	1
11:11	1
They	1
shall	1
tremble	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
dove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
houses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
Ephraim	1
compasseth	1
me	1
about	1
with	1
lies,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
deceit:	1
but	1
Judah	1
yet	1
ruleth	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
faithful	1
with	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
12:1	1
Ephraim	1
feedeth	1
on	1
wind,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
the	1
east	1
wind:	1
he	1
daily	1
increaseth	1
lies	1
and	1
desolation;	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
and	1
oil	1
is	1
carried	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
also	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
punish	1
Jacob	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways;	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
doings	1
will	1
he	1
recompense	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
brother	1
by	1
the	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
with	1
God:	1
12:4	1
Yea,	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
prevailed:	1
he	1
wept,	1
and	1
made	1
supplication	1
unto	1
him:	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
us;	1
12:5	1
Even	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
memorial.	1
	1
12:6	1
Therefore	1
turn	1
thou	1
to	1
thy	1
God:	1
keep	1
mercy	1
and	1
judgment	1
and	1
wait	1
on	1
thy	1
God	1
continually.	1
	1
12:7	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
merchant,	1
the	1
balances	1
of	1
deceit	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
he	1
loveth	1
to	1
oppress.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
said,	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
rich,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
me	1
out	1
substance:	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
labours	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
none	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
were	1
sin.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
yet	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
tabernacles,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
solemn	1
feast.	1
	1
12:10	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
multiplied	1
visions,	1
and	1
used	1
similitudes,	1
by	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
12:11	1
Is	1
there	1
iniquity	1
in	1
Gilead?	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
vanity:	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
bullocks	1
in	1
Gilgal;	1
yea,	1
their	1
altars	1
are	1
as	1
heaps	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
fields.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
Jacob	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Israel	1
served	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
kept	1
sheep.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
was	1
he	1
preserved.	1
	1
12:14	1
Ephraim	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
most	1
bitterly:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
leave	1
his	1
blood	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
reproach	1
shall	1
his	1
LORD	1
return	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:1	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
spake	1
trembling,	1
he	1
exalted	1
himself	1
in	1
Israel;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
offended	1
in	1
Baal,	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
sin	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
molten	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
silver,	1
and	1
idols	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
understanding,	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
craftsmen:	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
them,	1
Let	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
kiss	1
the	1
calves.	1
	1
13:3	1
Therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
cloud	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
that	1
passeth	1
away,	1
as	1
the	1
chaff	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney.	1
	1
13:4	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
no	1
god	1
but	1
me:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saviour	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
did	1
know	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
great	1
drought.	1
	1
13:6	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
pasture,	1
so	1
were	1
they	1
filled;	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
exalted;	1
therefore	1
have	1
they	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lion:	1
as	1
a	1
leopard	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
will	1
I	1
observe	1
them:	1
13:8	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
that	1
is	1
bereaved	1
of	1
her	1
whelps,	1
and	1
will	1
rend	1
the	1
caul	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
devour	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
shall	1
tear	1
them.	1
	1
13:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thyself;	1
but	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
thine	1
help.	1
	1
13:10	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
king:	1
where	1
is	1
any	1
other	1
that	1
may	1
save	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
cities?	1
and	1
thy	1
judges	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
princes?	1
	1
13:11	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
in	1
my	1
wrath.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
bound	1
up;	1
his	1
sin	1
is	1
hid.	1
	1
13:13	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
a	1
travailing	1
woman	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him:	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
unwise	1
son;	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
breaking	1
forth	1
of	1
children.	1
	1
13:14	1
I	1
will	1
ransom	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
grave;	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
death:	1
O	1
death,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
plagues;	1
O	1
grave,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
destruction:	1
repentance	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
13:15	1
Though	1
he	1
be	1
fruitful	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
shall	1
come,	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
his	1
spring	1
shall	1
become	1
dry,	1
and	1
his	1
fountain	1
shall	1
be	1
dried	1
up:	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
all	1
pleasant	1
vessels.	1
	1
13:16	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
become	1
desolate;	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
her	1
God:	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
their	1
infants	1
shall	1
be	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
ripped	1
up.	1
	1
14:1	1
O	1
israel,	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
fallen	1
by	1
thine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
14:2	1
Take	1
with	1
you	1
words,	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
away	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
receive	1
us	1
graciously:	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
render	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
our	1
lips.	1
	1
14:3	1
Asshur	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
us;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses:	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
gods:	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
the	1
fatherless	1
findeth	1
mercy.	1
	1
14:4	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
their	1
backsliding,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
freely:	1
for	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
unto	1
Israel:	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
lily,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
his	1
roots	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:6	1
His	1
branches	1
shall	1
spread,	1
and	1
his	1
beauty	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
and	1
his	1
smell	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:7	1
They	1
that	1
dwell	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
shall	1
return;	1
they	1
shall	1
revive	1
as	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
vine:	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:8	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
idols?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
observed	1
him:	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
fir	1
tree.	1
From	1
me	1
is	1
thy	1
fruit	1
found.	1
	1
14:9	1
Who	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
understand	1
these	1
things?	1
prudent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
right,	1
and	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
fall	1
therein.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Joel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Joel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pethuel.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear	1
this,	1
ye	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
Hath	1
this	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
	1
1:3	1
Tell	1
ye	1
your	1
children	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
children	1
tell	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
another	1
generation.	1
	1
1:4	1
That	1
which	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
locust	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
caterpiller	1
eaten.	1
	1
1:5	1
Awake,	1
ye	1
drunkards,	1
and	1
weep;	1
and	1
howl,	1
all	1
ye	1
drinkers	1
of	1
wine,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
wine;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:6	1
For	1
a	1
nation	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
my	1
land,	1
strong,	1
and	1
without	1
number,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
are	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
the	1
cheek	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
lion.	1
	1
1:7	1
He	1
hath	1
laid	1
my	1
vine	1
waste,	1
and	1
barked	1
my	1
fig	1
tree:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
clean	1
bare,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
away;	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
are	1
made	1
white.	1
	1
1:8	1
Lament	1
like	1
a	1
virgin	1
girded	1
with	1
sackcloth	1
for	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
her	1
youth.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
ministers,	1
mourn.	1
	1
1:10	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
wasted,	1
the	1
land	1
mourneth;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
wasted:	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
the	1
oil	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:11	1
Be	1
ye	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
ye	1
husbandmen;	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
vinedressers,	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
barley;	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
is	1
perished.	1
	1
1:12	1
The	1
vine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
languisheth;	1
the	1
pomegranate	1
tree,	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
apple	1
tree,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
are	1
withered:	1
because	1
joy	1
is	1
withered	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:13	1
Gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
lament,	1
ye	1
priests:	1
howl,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
come,	1
lie	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
sackcloth,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
withholden	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
Sanctify	1
ye	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
gather	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
1:15	1
Alas	1
for	1
the	1
day!	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty	1
shall	1
it	1
come.	1
	1
1:16	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
meat	1
cut	1
off	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
yea,	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
1:17	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
rotten	1
under	1
their	1
clods,	1
the	1
garners	1
are	1
laid	1
desolate,	1
the	1
barns	1
are	1
broken	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
withered.	1
	1
1:18	1
How	1
do	1
the	1
beasts	1
groan!	1
the	1
herds	1
of	1
cattle	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
pasture;	1
yea,	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
are	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
1:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
cry:	1
for	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
hath	1
burned	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
1:20	1
The	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
cry	1
also	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:1	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
sound	1
an	1
alarm	1
in	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
tremble:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand;	1
2:2	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
of	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
of	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains:	1
a	1
great	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
strong;	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
ever	1
the	1
like,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
it,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
2:3	1
A	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
flame	1
burneth:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness;	1
yea,	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
escape	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
horses;	1
and	1
as	1
horsemen,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
run.	1
	1
2:5	1
Like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
chariots	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
mountains	1
shall	1
they	1
leap,	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
that	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble,	1
as	1
a	1
strong	1
people	1
set	1
in	1
battle	1
array.	1
	1
2:6	1
Before	1
their	1
face	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
pained:	1
all	1
faces	1
shall	1
gather	1
blackness.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
mighty	1
men;	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
men	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
march	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
their	1
ranks:	1
2:8	1
Neither	1
shall	1
one	1
thrust	1
another;	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
path:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
sword,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wounded.	1
	1
2:9	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
houses;	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
like	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
earth	1
shall	1
quake	1
before	1
them;	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
tremble:	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
dark,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining:	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
before	1
his	1
army:	1
for	1
his	1
camp	1
is	1
very	1
great:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
that	1
executeth	1
his	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
very	1
terrible;	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
it?	1
2:12	1
Therefore	1
also	1
now,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
turn	1
ye	1
even	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
mourning:	1
2:13	1
And	1
rend	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
not	1
your	1
garments,	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repenteth	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
2:14	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
leave	1
a	1
blessing	1
behind	1
him;	1
even	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God?	1
	1
2:15	1
Blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
sanctify	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly:	1
2:16	1
Gather	1
the	1
people,	1
sanctify	1
the	1
congregation,	1
assemble	1
the	1
elders,	1
gather	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
suck	1
the	1
breasts:	1
let	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
closet.	1
	1
2:17	1
Let	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
weep	1
between	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
say,	1
Spare	1
thy	1
people,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
give	1
not	1
thine	1
heritage	1
to	1
reproach,	1
that	1
the	1
heathen	1
should	1
rule	1
over	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
they	1
say	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
Where	1
is	1
their	1
God?	1
2:18	1
Then	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
jealous	1
for	1
his	1
land,	1
and	1
pity	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
2:19	1
Yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
you	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
therewith:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
2:20	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
you	1
the	1
northern	1
army,	1
and	1
will	1
drive	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
barren	1
and	1
desolate,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
hinder	1
part	1
toward	1
the	1
utmost	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
stink	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
ill	1
savour	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
Fear	1
not,	1
O	1
land;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:22	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
ye	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
for	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
do	1
spring,	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
beareth	1
her	1
fruit,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
vine	1
do	1
yield	1
their	1
strength.	1
	1
2:23	1
Be	1
glad	1
then,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
former	1
rain	1
moderately,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
you	1
the	1
rain,	1
the	1
former	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
floors	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
the	1
vats	1
shall	1
overflow	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
oil.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
eaten,	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
and	1
the	1
caterpiller,	1
and	1
the	1
palmerworm,	1
my	1
great	1
army	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
in	1
plenty,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
hath	1
dealt	1
wondrously	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
none	1
else:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh;	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams,	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions:	1
2:29	1
And	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
handmaids	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
will	1
I	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
pillars	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
2:31	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered:	1
for	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
remnant	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
3:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
3:2	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
gather	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
heritage	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
scattered	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
parted	1
my	1
land.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
boy	1
for	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
sold	1
a	1
girl	1
for	1
wine,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
drink.	1
	1
3:4	1
Yea,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me,	1
O	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Palestine?	1
will	1
ye	1
render	1
me	1
a	1
recompence?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
recompense	1
me,	1
swiftly	1
and	1
speedily	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head;	1
3:5	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
my	1
silver	1
and	1
my	1
gold,	1
and	1
have	1
carried	1
into	1
your	1
temples	1
my	1
goodly	1
pleasant	1
things:	1
3:6	1
The	1
children	1
also	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
ye	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
remove	1
them	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
3:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
ye	1
have	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head:	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sell	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sell	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Sabeans,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
far	1
off:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
3:9	1
Proclaim	1
ye	1
this	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
Prepare	1
war,	1
wake	1
up	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
draw	1
near;	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
up:	1
3:10	1
Beat	1
your	1
plowshares	1
into	1
swords	1
and	1
your	1
pruninghooks	1
into	1
spears:	1
let	1
the	1
weak	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
strong.	1
	1
3:11	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come,	1
all	1
ye	1
heathen,	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
round	1
about:	1
thither	1
cause	1
thy	1
mighty	1
ones	1
to	1
come	1
down,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
heathen	1
be	1
wakened,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat:	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
sit	1
to	1
judge	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
3:13	1
Put	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
ripe:	1
come,	1
get	1
you	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
press	1
is	1
full,	1
the	1
fats	1
overflow;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
3:14	1
Multitudes,	1
multitudes	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining.	1
	1
3:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
roar	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
shake:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:17	1
So	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
dwelling	1
in	1
Zion,	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
then	1
shall	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
holy,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
strangers	1
pass	1
through	1
her	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
down	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
waters,	1
and	1
a	1
fountain	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
water	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shittim.	1
	1
3:19	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness,	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
3:20	1
But	1
Judah	1
shall	1
dwell	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
3:21	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cleanse	1
their	1
blood	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
cleansed:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
Zion.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Amos	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Amos,	1
who	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Tekoa,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
roar	1
from	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel	1
shall	1
wither.	1
	1
1:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
threshed	1
Gilead	1
with	1
threshing	1
instruments	1
of	1
iron:	1
1:4	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Hazael,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Benhadad.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
also	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Aven,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eden:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Syria	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Kir,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity,	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
Edom:	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof:	1
1:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
Ekron:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
shall	1
perish,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity	1
to	1
Edom,	1
and	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
brotherly	1
covenant:	1
1:10	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
pursue	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
pity,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
did	1
tear	1
perpetually,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
wrath	1
for	1
ever:	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Teman,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Bozrah.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
ripped	1
up	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enlarge	1
their	1
border:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof,	1
with	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
with	1
a	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
1:15	1
And	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
burned	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
into	1
lime:	1
2:2	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Moab,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Kirioth:	1
and	1
Moab	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
tumult,	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet:	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
slay	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof	1
with	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
their	1
lies	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
after	1
the	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
walked:	1
2:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
sold	1
the	1
righteous	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
2:7	1
That	1
pant	1
after	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
meek:	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
same	1
maid,	1
to	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name:	1
2:8	1
And	1
they	1
lay	1
themselves	1
down	1
upon	1
clothes	1
laid	1
to	1
pledge	1
by	1
every	1
altar,	1
and	1
they	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
god.	1
	1
2:9	1
Yet	1
destroyed	1
I	1
the	1
Amorite	1
before	1
them,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
cedars,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
strong	1
as	1
the	1
oaks;	1
yet	1
I	1
destroyed	1
his	1
fruit	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
his	1
roots	1
from	1
beneath.	1
	1
2:10	1
Also	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
led	1
you	1
forty	1
years	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorite.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
I	1
raised	1
up	1
of	1
your	1
sons	1
for	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
for	1
Nazarites.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
even	1
thus,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
ye	1
gave	1
the	1
Nazarites	1
wine	1
to	1
drink;	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy	1
not.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
pressed	1
under	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
cart	1
is	1
pressed	1
that	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
sheaves.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
flight	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
swift,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
shall	1
not	1
strengthen	1
his	1
force,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
mighty	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
2:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand	1
that	1
handleth	1
the	1
bow;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
swift	1
of	1
foot	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
rideth	1
the	1
horse	1
deliver	1
himself.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
courageous	1
among	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
flee	1
away	1
naked	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
you,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
against	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
You	1
only	1
have	1
I	1
known	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
iniquities.	1
	1
3:3	1
Can	1
two	1
walk	1
together,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
agreed?	1
	1
3:4	1
Will	1
a	1
lion	1
roar	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
prey?	1
will	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
den,	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing?	1
	1
3:5	1
Can	1
a	1
bird	1
fall	1
in	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
where	1
no	1
gin	1
is	1
for	1
him?	1
	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
snare	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing	1
at	1
all?	1
	1
3:6	1
Shall	1
a	1
trumpet	1
be	1
blown	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
not	1
be	1
afraid?	1
	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
evil	1
in	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
done	1
it?	1
	1
3:7	1
Surely	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
do	1
nothing,	1
but	1
he	1
revealeth	1
his	1
secret	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
lion	1
hath	1
roared,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
fear?	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
who	1
can	1
but	1
prophesy?	1
	1
3:9	1
Publish	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
at	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
say,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
great	1
tumults	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
oppressed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
right,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
store	1
up	1
violence	1
and	1
robbery	1
in	1
their	1
palaces.	1
	1
3:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
An	1
adversary	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
thy	1
strength	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
palaces	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
As	1
the	1
shepherd	1
taketh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
two	1
legs,	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
an	1
ear;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Samaria	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
in	1
Damascus	1
in	1
a	1
couch.	1
	1
3:13	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
3:14	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
visit	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
upon	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
visit	1
the	1
altars	1
of	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
winter	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
summer	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
ivory	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
houses	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
end,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word,	1
ye	1
kine	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
oppress	1
the	1
poor,	1
which	1
crush	1
the	1
needy,	1
which	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
Bring,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
drink.	1
	1
4:2	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
his	1
holiness,	1
that,	1
lo,	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
hooks,	1
and	1
your	1
posterity	1
with	1
fishhooks.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
breaches,	1
every	1
cow	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
her;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
palace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:4	1
Come	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
transgress;	1
at	1
Gilgal	1
multiply	1
transgression;	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
your	1
tithes	1
after	1
three	1
years:	1
4:5	1
And	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
with	1
leaven,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
and	1
publish	1
the	1
free	1
offerings:	1
for	1
this	1
liketh	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
cleanness	1
of	1
teeth	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
cities,	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
places:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
withholden	1
the	1
rain	1
from	1
you,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
yet	1
three	1
months	1
to	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
one	1
city,	1
and	1
caused	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
another	1
city:	1
one	1
piece	1
was	1
rained	1
upon,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
whereupon	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
So	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
cities	1
wandered	1
unto	1
one	1
city,	1
to	1
drink	1
water;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
satisfied:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:9	1
I	1
have	1
smitten	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
mildew:	1
when	1
your	1
gardens	1
and	1
your	1
vineyards	1
and	1
your	1
fig	1
trees	1
and	1
your	1
olive	1
trees	1
increased,	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
devoured	1
them:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:10	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
among	1
you	1
the	1
pestilence	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
I	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
your	1
horses;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
stink	1
of	1
your	1
camps	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
your	1
nostrils:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
have	1
overthrown	1
some	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
firebrand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
burning:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:12	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
unto	1
thee,	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
thy	1
God,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:13	1
For,	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
formeth	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
createth	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
declareth	1
unto	1
man	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
thought,	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
morning	1
darkness,	1
and	1
treadeth	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
against	1
you,	1
even	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:2	1
The	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
fallen;	1
she	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
rise:	1
she	1
is	1
forsaken	1
upon	1
her	1
land;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
The	1
city	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
shall	1
leave	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
by	1
an	1
hundred	1
shall	1
leave	1
ten,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live:	1
5:5	1
But	1
seek	1
not	1
Bethel,	1
nor	1
enter	1
into	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
pass	1
not	1
to	1
Beersheba:	1
for	1
Gilgal	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
Bethel	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:6	1
Seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live;	1
lest	1
he	1
break	1
out	1
like	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
devour	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
quench	1
it	1
in	1
Bethel.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
who	1
turn	1
judgment	1
to	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
leave	1
off	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
5:8	1
Seek	1
him	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
and	1
Orion,	1
and	1
turneth	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
into	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
maketh	1
the	1
day	1
dark	1
with	1
night:	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
5:9	1
That	1
strengtheneth	1
the	1
spoiled	1
against	1
the	1
strong,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
spoiled	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
fortress.	1
	1
5:10	1
They	1
hate	1
him	1
that	1
rebuketh	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
they	1
abhor	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
uprightly.	1
	1
5:11	1
Forasmuch	1
therefore	1
as	1
your	1
treading	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
ye	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
burdens	1
of	1
wheat:	1
ye	1
have	1
built	1
houses	1
of	1
hewn	1
stone,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
ye	1
have	1
planted	1
pleasant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
manifold	1
transgressions	1
and	1
your	1
mighty	1
sins:	1
they	1
afflict	1
the	1
just,	1
they	1
take	1
a	1
bribe,	1
and	1
they	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
from	1
their	1
right.	1
	1
5:13	1
Therefore	1
the	1
prudent	1
shall	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
that	1
time;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
time.	1
	1
5:14	1
Seek	1
good,	1
and	1
not	1
evil,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
5:15	1
Hate	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
establish	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
5:16	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saith	1
thus;	1
Wailing	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
streets;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
highways,	1
Alas!	1
alas!	1
	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
husbandman	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
skilful	1
of	1
lamentation	1
to	1
wailing.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
vineyards	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
desire	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD!	1
to	1
what	1
end	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
you?	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light.	1
	1
5:19	1
As	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
did	1
flee	1
from	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear	1
met	1
him;	1
or	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
a	1
serpent	1
bit	1
him.	1
	1
5:20	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light?	1
even	1
very	1
dark,	1
and	1
no	1
brightness	1
in	1
it?	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
hate,	1
I	1
despise	1
your	1
feast	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smell	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
assemblies.	1
	1
5:22	1
Though	1
ye	1
offer	1
me	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
your	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
them:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
regard	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
your	1
fat	1
beasts.	1
	1
5:23	1
Take	1
thou	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
songs;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
melody	1
of	1
thy	1
viols.	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
let	1
judgment	1
run	1
down	1
as	1
waters,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
stream.	1
	1
5:25	1
Have	1
ye	1
offered	1
unto	1
me	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
offerings	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
5:26	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
your	1
Moloch	1
and	1
Chiun	1
your	1
images,	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god,	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:27	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
beyond	1
Damascus,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
are	1
named	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
came!	1
	1
6:2	1
Pass	1
ye	1
unto	1
Calneh,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
go	1
ye	1
to	1
Hamath	1
the	1
great:	1
then	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Gath	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
be	1
they	1
better	1
than	1
these	1
kingdoms?	1
or	1
their	1
border	1
greater	1
than	1
your	1
border?	1
6:3	1
Ye	1
that	1
put	1
far	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
cause	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
violence	1
to	1
come	1
near;	1
6:4	1
That	1
lie	1
upon	1
beds	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
stretch	1
themselves	1
upon	1
their	1
couches,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
lambs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
calves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
stall;	1
6:5	1
That	1
chant	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
viol,	1
and	1
invent	1
to	1
themselves	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
like	1
David;	1
6:6	1
That	1
drink	1
wine	1
in	1
bowls,	1
and	1
anoint	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
ointments:	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
6:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
captive	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
go	1
captive,	1
and	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
shall	1
be	1
removed.	1
	1
6:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
himself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
abhor	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
hate	1
his	1
palaces:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
there	1
remain	1
ten	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
house,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
uncle	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
him,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
with	1
thee?	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
No.	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
tongue:	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:11	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
commandeth,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
with	1
breaches,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
house	1
with	1
clefts.	1
	1
6:12	1
Shall	1
horses	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
rock?	1
will	1
one	1
plow	1
there	1
with	1
oxen?	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
turned	1
judgment	1
into	1
gall,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
into	1
hemlock:	1
6:13	1
Ye	1
which	1
rejoice	1
in	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought,	1
which	1
say,	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
taken	1
to	1
us	1
horns	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
strength?	1
	1
6:14	1
But,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
against	1
you	1
a	1
nation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
afflict	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hemath	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
7:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
formed	1
grasshoppers	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
shooting	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
growth;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
latter	1
growth	1
after	1
the	1
king's	1
mowings.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
eating	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
forgive,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:4	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
called	1
to	1
contend	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
devoured	1
the	1
great	1
deep,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
a	1
part.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
cease,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
This	1
also	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
7:7	1
Thus	1
he	1
shewed	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
upon	1
a	1
wall	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
plumbline,	1
with	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
plumbline.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuaries	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Bethel	1
sent	1
to	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Amos	1
hath	1
conspired	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
all	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
thus	1
Amos	1
saith,	1
Jeroboam	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
7:12	1
Also	1
Amaziah	1
said	1
unto	1
Amos,	1
O	1
thou	1
seer,	1
go,	1
flee	1
thee	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
there	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
there:	1
7:13	1
But	1
prophesy	1
not	1
again	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
Bethel:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
chapel,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
court.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Amos,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Amaziah,	1
I	1
was	1
no	1
prophet,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
a	1
prophet's	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
herdman,	1
and	1
a	1
gatherer	1
of	1
sycomore	1
fruit:	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
took	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hear	1
thou	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Thou	1
sayest,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
drop	1
not	1
thy	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Isaac.	1
	1
7:17	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
harlot	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
by	1
line;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
in	1
a	1
polluted	1
land:	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
8:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
end	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
shall	1
be	1
howlings	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
dead	1
bodies	1
in	1
every	1
place;	1
they	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
forth	1
with	1
silence.	1
	1
8:4	1
Hear	1
this,	1
O	1
ye	1
that	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
needy,	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
fail,	1
8:5	1
Saying,	1
When	1
will	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
be	1
gone,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sell	1
corn?	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
set	1
forth	1
wheat,	1
making	1
the	1
ephah	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
shekel	1
great,	1
and	1
falsifying	1
the	1
balances	1
by	1
deceit?	1
	1
8:6	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
buy	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
yea,	1
and	1
sell	1
the	1
refuse	1
of	1
the	1
wheat?	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
8:8	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
land	1
tremble	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
mourn	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
as	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
at	1
noon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
darken	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
day:	1
8:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
your	1
feasts	1
into	1
mourning,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
songs	1
into	1
lamentation;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
baldness	1
upon	1
every	1
head;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
as	1
a	1
bitter	1
day.	1
	1
8:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
not	1
a	1
famine	1
of	1
bread,	1
nor	1
a	1
thirst	1
for	1
water,	1
but	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
8:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
fair	1
virgins	1
and	1
young	1
men	1
faint	1
for	1
thirst.	1
	1
8:14	1
They	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thy	1
god,	1
O	1
Dan,	1
liveth;	1
and,	1
The	1
manner	1
of	1
Beersheba	1
liveth;	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
never	1
rise	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Smite	1
the	1
lintel	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
the	1
posts	1
may	1
shake:	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
all	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
he	1
that	1
fleeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
escapeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
9:2	1
Though	1
they	1
dig	1
into	1
hell,	1
thence	1
shall	1
mine	1
hand	1
take	1
them;	1
though	1
they	1
climb	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
down:	1
9:3	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel,	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
thence;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
serpent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bite	1
them:	1
9:4	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
slay	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
melt,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
mourn:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
like	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:6	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
buildeth	1
his	1
stories	1
in	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
hath	1
founded	1
his	1
troop	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
9:7	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Caphtor,	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
from	1
Kir?	1
9:8	1
Behold,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
sinful	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
it	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
saving	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
command,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sift	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
like	1
as	1
corn	1
is	1
sifted	1
in	1
a	1
sieve,	1
yet	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
grain	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:10	1
All	1
the	1
sinners	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
say,	1
The	1
evil	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
nor	1
prevent	1
us.	1
	1
9:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David	1
that	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
close	1
up	1
the	1
breaches	1
thereof;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
his	1
ruins,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old:	1
9:12	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
possess	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
doeth	1
this.	1
	1
9:13	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
plowman	1
shall	1
overtake	1
the	1
reaper,	1
and	1
the	1
treader	1
of	1
grapes	1
him	1
that	1
soweth	1
seed;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
melt.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
waste	1
cities,	1
and	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof;	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
make	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them	1
upon	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
pulled	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Obadiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
vision	1
of	1
Obadiah.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
concerning	1
Edom;	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
rumour	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
ambassador	1
is	1
sent	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
1:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
small	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
despised.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
pride	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
hath	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
whose	1
habitation	1
is	1
high;	1
that	1
saith	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
1:4	1
Though	1
thou	1
exalt	1
thyself	1
as	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
though	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
nest	1
among	1
the	1
stars,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
thieves	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
if	1
robbers	1
by	1
night,	1
(how	1
art	1
thou	1
cut	1
off!)	1
	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
stolen	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
enough?	1
if	1
the	1
grapegatherers	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
leave	1
some	1
grapes?	1
	1
1:6	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
Esau	1
searched	1
out!	1
how	1
are	1
his	1
hidden	1
things	1
sought	1
up!	1
	1
1:7	1
All	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
thy	1
confederacy	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
border:	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
thee	1
have	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
thee;	1
that	1
they	1
eat	1
thy	1
bread	1
have	1
laid	1
a	1
wound	1
under	1
thee:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
understanding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
understanding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men,	1
O	1
Teman,	1
shall	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
by	1
slaughter.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
thy	1
violence	1
against	1
thy	1
brother	1
Jacob	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
strangers	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
his	1
forces,	1
and	1
foreigners	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
gates,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
thou	1
wast	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
stranger;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
destruction;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
spoken	1
proudly	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
their	1
affliction	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity,	1
nor	1
have	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
their	1
substance	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
1:14	1
Neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
crossway,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
escape;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
heathen:	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
thee:	1
thy	1
reward	1
shall	1
return	1
upon	1
thine	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
drunk	1
upon	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
so	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
drink	1
continually,	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
swallow	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been.	1
	1
1:17	1
But	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
possess	1
their	1
possessions.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
a	1
flame,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau	1
for	1
stubble,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kindle	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
devour	1
them;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
remaining	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
shall	1
possess	1
Gilead.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
this	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
possess	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
even	1
unto	1
Zarephath;	1
and	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Sepharad,	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
saviours	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
mount	1
Zion	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Jonah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amittai,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
cry	1
against	1
it;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:3	1
But	1
Jonah	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
flee	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
going	1
to	1
Tarshish:	1
so	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
fare	1
thereof,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
it,	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
1:5	1
Then	1
the	1
mariners	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
cried	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
wares	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
to	1
lighten	1
it	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
Jonah	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
	1
1:6	1
So	1
the	1
shipmaster	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou,	1
O	1
sleeper?	1
arise,	1
call	1
upon	1
thy	1
God,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
think	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
fellow,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cast	1
lots,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us.	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
lots,	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Jonah.	1
	1
1:8	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us;	1
What	1
is	1
thine	1
occupation?	1
and	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
country?	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
people	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Hebrew;	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
1:10	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
men	1
exceedingly	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him.	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
this?	1
For	1
the	1
men	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
them.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
sea	1
may	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
us?	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
sea	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
1:13	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
men	1
rowed	1
hard	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
land;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
1:14	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
perish	1
for	1
this	1
man's	1
life,	1
and	1
lay	1
not	1
upon	1
us	1
innocent	1
blood:	1
for	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
done	1
as	1
it	1
pleased	1
thee.	1
	1
1:15	1
So	1
they	1
look	1
up	1
Jonah,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
ceased	1
from	1
her	1
raging.	1
	1
1:16	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
vows.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
prepared	1
a	1
great	1
fish	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
Jonah.	1
And	1
Jonah	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
Jonah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fish's	1
belly,	1
2:2	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
cried	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
mine	1
affliction	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me;	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
hell	1
cried	1
I,	1
and	1
thou	1
heardest	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
thou	1
hadst	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
all	1
thy	1
billows	1
and	1
thy	1
waves	1
passed	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sight;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
again	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
waters	1
compassed	1
me	1
about,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
soul:	1
the	1
depth	1
closed	1
me	1
round	1
about,	1
the	1
weeds	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
2:6	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottoms	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
bars	1
was	1
about	1
me	1
for	1
ever:	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
up	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
corruption,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
2:7	1
When	1
my	1
soul	1
fainted	1
within	1
me	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
my	1
prayer	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
thee,	1
into	1
thine	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:8	1
They	1
that	1
observe	1
lying	1
vanities	1
forsake	1
their	1
own	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thanksgiving;	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
vowed.	1
Salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
it	1
vomited	1
out	1
Jonah	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
it	1
the	1
preaching	1
that	1
I	1
bid	1
thee.	1
	1
3:3	1
So	1
Jonah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Now	1
Nineveh	1
was	1
an	1
exceeding	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
three	1
days'	1
journey.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Jonah	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
day's	1
journey,	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
said,	1
Yet	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown.	1
	1
3:5	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
sackcloth,	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
word	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Nineveh,	1
and	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
robe	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
ashes.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
and	1
published	1
through	1
Nineveh	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
nobles,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
beast,	1
herd	1
nor	1
flock,	1
taste	1
any	1
thing:	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
feed,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water:	1
3:8	1
But	1
let	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
unto	1
God:	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
turn	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
violence	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
3:9	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
if	1
God	1
will	1
turn	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
their	1
works,	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
from	1
their	1
evil	1
way;	1
and	1
God	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
it	1
displeased	1
Jonah	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
angry.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
my	1
saying,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
country?	1
Therefore	1
I	1
fled	1
before	1
unto	1
Tarshish:	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gracious	1
God,	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repentest	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
take,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry?	1
	1
4:5	1
So	1
Jonah	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
booth,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
shadow,	1
till	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
gourd,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
over	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
shadow	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
grief.	1
So	1
Jonah	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
gourd.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
worm	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
rose	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
it	1
smote	1
the	1
gourd	1
that	1
it	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
arise,	1
that	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
vehement	1
east	1
wind;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
beat	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
he	1
fainted,	1
and	1
wished	1
in	1
himself	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
to	1
Jonah,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
for	1
the	1
gourd?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry,	1
even	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
gourd,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
laboured,	1
neither	1
madest	1
it	1
grow;	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
night,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
a	1
night:	1
4:11	1
And	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
spare	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
are	1
more	1
then	1
sixscore	1
thousand	1
persons	1
that	1
cannot	1
discern	1
between	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
their	1
left	1
hand;	1
and	1
also	1
much	1
cattle?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Micah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Micah	1
the	1
Morasthite	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear,	1
all	1
ye	1
people;	1
hearken,	1
O	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
therein	1
is:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
be	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
1:3	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
tread	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
molten	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
valleys	1
shall	1
be	1
cleft,	1
as	1
wax	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
are	1
poured	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
Samaria?	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Judah?	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
1:6	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Samaria	1
as	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
plantings	1
of	1
a	1
vineyard:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
down	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof	1
into	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hires	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
thereof	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
desolate:	1
for	1
she	1
gathered	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot.	1
	1
1:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
wail	1
and	1
howl,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
stripped	1
and	1
naked:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
wailing	1
like	1
the	1
dragons,	1
and	1
mourning	1
as	1
the	1
owls.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
her	1
wound	1
is	1
incurable;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
Judah;	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
even	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:10	1
Declare	1
ye	1
it	1
not	1
at	1
Gath,	1
weep	1
ye	1
not	1
at	1
all:	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Aphrah	1
roll	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
1:11	1
Pass	1
ye	1
away,	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Saphir,	1
having	1
thy	1
shame	1
naked:	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zaanan	1
came	1
not	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Bethezel;	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
you	1
his	1
standing.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Maroth	1
waited	1
carefully	1
for	1
good:	1
but	1
evil	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:13	1
O	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
bind	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
the	1
swift	1
beast:	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
1:14	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
presents	1
to	1
Moreshethgath:	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Achzib	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:15	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
an	1
heir	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Mareshah:	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
Adullam	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Make	1
thee	1
bald,	1
and	1
poll	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
delicate	1
children;	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
baldness	1
as	1
the	1
eagle;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
2:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
devise	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
work	1
evil	1
upon	1
their	1
beds!	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
light,	1
they	1
practise	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
they	1
covet	1
fields,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
by	1
violence;	1
and	1
houses,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
away:	1
so	1
they	1
oppress	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
heritage.	1
	1
2:3	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
against	1
this	1
family	1
do	1
I	1
devise	1
an	1
evil,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
remove	1
your	1
necks;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
go	1
haughtily:	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
2:4	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
lament	1
with	1
a	1
doleful	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
say,	1
We	1
be	1
utterly	1
spoiled:	1
he	1
hath	1
changed	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
people:	1
how	1
hath	1
he	1
removed	1
it	1
from	1
me!	1
turning	1
away	1
he	1
hath	1
divided	1
our	1
fields.	1
	1
2:5	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
that	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
cord	1
by	1
lot	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:6	1
Prophesy	1
ye	1
not,	1
say	1
they	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prophesy	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
shame.	1
	1
2:7	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
named	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
straitened?	1
are	1
these	1
his	1
doings?	1
do	1
not	1
my	1
words	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
walketh	1
uprightly?	1
	1
2:8	1
Even	1
of	1
late	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
enemy:	1
ye	1
pull	1
off	1
the	1
robe	1
with	1
the	1
garment	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
pass	1
by	1
securely	1
as	1
men	1
averse	1
from	1
war.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
women	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
ye	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
pleasant	1
houses;	1
from	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
ye	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:10	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
depart;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
rest:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
polluted,	1
it	1
shall	1
destroy	1
you,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:11	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
falsehood	1
do	1
lie,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
of	1
strong	1
drink;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
assemble,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
all	1
of	1
thee;	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
gather	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
them	1
together	1
as	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
Bozrah,	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
fold:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
great	1
noise	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
2:13	1
The	1
breaker	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
by	1
it:	1
and	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
pass	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
O	1
heads	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ye	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:2	1
Who	1
hate	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
evil;	1
who	1
pluck	1
off	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
bones;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
also	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
flay	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
break	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
chop	1
them	1
in	1
pieces,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
pot,	1
and	1
as	1
flesh	1
within	1
the	1
caldron.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
them:	1
he	1
will	1
even	1
hide	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
behaved	1
themselves	1
ill	1
in	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
make	1
my	1
people	1
err,	1
that	1
bite	1
with	1
their	1
teeth,	1
and	1
cry,	1
Peace;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
not	1
into	1
their	1
mouths,	1
they	1
even	1
prepare	1
war	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
3:6	1
Therefore	1
night	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
divine;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
seers	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
confounded:	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
cover	1
their	1
lips;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:8	1
But	1
truly	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
power	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
of	1
might,	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
his	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
3:9	1
Hear	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
ye	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
abhor	1
judgment,	1
and	1
pervert	1
all	1
equity.	1
	1
3:10	1
They	1
build	1
up	1
Zion	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
iniquity.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
heads	1
thereof	1
judge	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
teach	1
for	1
hire,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
thereof	1
divine	1
for	1
money:	1
yet	1
will	1
they	1
lean	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
say,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
us?	1
none	1
evil	1
can	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
3:12	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
Zion	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
be	1
plowed	1
as	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
the	1
hills;	1
and	1
people	1
shall	1
flow	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
say,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
paths:	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
among	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
strong	1
nations	1
afar	1
off;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
beat	1
their	1
swords	1
into	1
plowshares,	1
and	1
their	1
spears	1
into	1
pruninghooks:	1
nation	1
shall	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
sword	1
against	1
nation,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
learn	1
war	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
sit	1
every	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
fig	1
tree;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
all	1
people	1
will	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
4:6	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
assemble	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted;	1
4:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
that	1
halted	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
far	1
off	1
a	1
strong	1
nation:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
from	1
henceforth,	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
it	1
come,	1
even	1
the	1
first	1
dominion;	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:9	1
Now	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
cry	1
out	1
aloud?	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
thee?	1
is	1
thy	1
counsellor	1
perished?	1
for	1
pangs	1
have	1
taken	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
4:10	1
Be	1
in	1
pain,	1
and	1
labour	1
to	1
bring	1
forth,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail:	1
for	1
now	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
even	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered;	1
there	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
redeem	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:11	1
Now	1
also	1
many	1
nations	1
are	1
gathered	1
against	1
thee,	1
that	1
say,	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
let	1
our	1
eye	1
look	1
upon	1
Zion.	1
	1
4:12	1
But	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
understand	1
they	1
his	1
counsel:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
sheaves	1
into	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
4:13	1
Arise	1
and	1
thresh,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thine	1
horn	1
iron,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
hoofs	1
brass:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
in	1
pieces	1
many	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consecrate	1
their	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
gather	1
thyself	1
in	1
troops,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
troops:	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
siege	1
against	1
us:	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
judge	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek.	1
	1
5:2	1
But	1
thou,	1
Bethlehem	1
Ephratah,	1
though	1
thou	1
be	1
little	1
among	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Judah,	1
yet	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
he	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
in	1
Israel;	1
whose	1
goings	1
forth	1
have	1
been	1
from	1
of	1
old,	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
5:3	1
Therefore	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
them	1
up,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
which	1
travaileth	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth:	1
then	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
abide:	1
for	1
now	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
great	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
peace,	1
when	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
land:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
tread	1
in	1
our	1
palaces,	1
then	1
shall	1
we	1
raise	1
against	1
him	1
seven	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
eight	1
principal	1
men.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
waste	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nimrod	1
in	1
the	1
entrances	1
thereof:	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
our	1
land,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
treadeth	1
within	1
our	1
borders.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
dew	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
showers	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
that	1
tarrieth	1
not	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep:	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
go	1
through,	1
both	1
treadeth	1
down,	1
and	1
teareth	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
deliver.	1
	1
5:9	1
Thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
horses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
chariots:	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
all	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
5:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
witchcrafts	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
soothsayers:	1
5:13	1
Thy	1
graven	1
images	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
thy	1
standing	1
images	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
worship	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
up	1
thy	1
groves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
thy	1
cities.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
vengeance	1
in	1
anger	1
and	1
fury	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen,	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard.	1
	1
6:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
now	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith;	1
Arise,	1
contend	1
thou	1
before	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
hills	1
hear	1
thy	1
voice.	1
	1
6:2	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
O	1
mountains,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
controversy,	1
and	1
ye	1
strong	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:3	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
wherein	1
have	1
I	1
wearied	1
thee?	1
testify	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
I	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
servants;	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
before	1
thee	1
Moses,	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
Miriam.	1
	1
6:5	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
remember	1
now	1
what	1
Balak	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
consulted,	1
and	1
what	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
answered	1
him	1
from	1
Shittim	1
unto	1
Gilgal;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
bow	1
myself	1
before	1
the	1
high	1
God?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
with	1
calves	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
old?	1
	1
6:7	1
Will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thousands	1
of	1
rams,	1
or	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
rivers	1
of	1
oil?	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
firstborn	1
for	1
my	1
transgression,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
soul?	1
	1
6:8	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
thee,	1
O	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
what	1
doth	1
the	1
LORD	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
justly,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
mercy,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
humbly	1
with	1
thy	1
God?	1
	1
6:9	1
The	1
LORD's	1
voice	1
crieth	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
wisdom	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
name:	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
Are	1
there	1
yet	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
the	1
scant	1
measure	1
that	1
is	1
abominable?	1
	1
6:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
count	1
them	1
pure	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
balances,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
bag	1
of	1
deceitful	1
weights?	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
thereof	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
is	1
deceitful	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
sick	1
in	1
smiting	1
thee,	1
in	1
making	1
thee	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
6:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat,	1
but	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
thy	1
casting	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
hold,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
deliver;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
deliverest	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
6:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sow,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
reap;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tread	1
the	1
olives,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
anoint	1
thee	1
with	1
oil;	1
and	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
drink	1
wine.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
Omri	1
are	1
kept,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
counsels;	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
an	1
hissing:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
the	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
as	1
the	1
grapegleanings	1
of	1
the	1
vintage:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
cluster	1
to	1
eat:	1
my	1
soul	1
desired	1
the	1
firstripe	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:2	1
The	1
good	1
man	1
is	1
perished	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
upright	1
among	1
men:	1
they	1
all	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
blood;	1
they	1
hunt	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
net.	1
	1
7:3	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
evil	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
earnestly,	1
the	1
prince	1
asketh,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
asketh	1
for	1
a	1
reward;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
man,	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
mischievous	1
desire:	1
so	1
they	1
wrap	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
brier:	1
the	1
most	1
upright	1
is	1
sharper	1
than	1
a	1
thorn	1
hedge:	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
watchmen	1
and	1
thy	1
visitation	1
cometh;	1
now	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
perplexity.	1
	1
7:5	1
Trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
friend,	1
put	1
ye	1
not	1
confidence	1
in	1
a	1
guide:	1
keep	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
lieth	1
in	1
thy	1
bosom.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
the	1
son	1
dishonoureth	1
the	1
father,	1
the	1
daughter	1
riseth	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law;	1
a	1
man's	1
enemies	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
7:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation:	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
against	1
me,	1
O	1
mine	1
enemy:	1
when	1
I	1
fall,	1
I	1
shall	1
arise;	1
when	1
I	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
will	1
bear	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him,	1
until	1
he	1
plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
execute	1
judgment	1
for	1
me:	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
mine	1
enemy	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
her	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God?	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
her:	1
now	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
7:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thy	1
walls	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
built,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
decree	1
be	1
far	1
removed.	1
	1
7:12	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortified	1
cities,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortress	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
mountain	1
to	1
mountain.	1
	1
7:13	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
for	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
7:14	1
Feed	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
thy	1
rod,	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
thine	1
heritage,	1
which	1
dwell	1
solitarily	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Carmel:	1
let	1
them	1
feed	1
in	1
Bashan	1
and	1
Gilead,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
7:15	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
unto	1
him	1
marvellous	1
things.	1
	1
7:16	1
The	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
be	1
confounded	1
at	1
all	1
their	1
might:	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hand	1
upon	1
their	1
mouth,	1
their	1
ears	1
shall	1
be	1
deaf.	1
	1
7:17	1
They	1
shall	1
lick	1
the	1
dust	1
like	1
a	1
serpent,	1
they	1
shall	1
move	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
holes	1
like	1
worms	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
7:18	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
pardoneth	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
passeth	1
by	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
heritage?	1
he	1
retaineth	1
not	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
mercy.	1
	1
7:19	1
He	1
will	1
turn	1
again,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
us;	1
he	1
will	1
subdue	1
our	1
iniquities;	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
cast	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
7:20	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
perform	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
the	1
mercy	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sworn	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Nahum	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Nineveh.	1
The	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
Nahum	1
the	1
Elkoshite.	1
	1
1:2	1
God	1
is	1
jealous,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth;	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth,	1
and	1
is	1
furious;	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
he	1
reserveth	1
wrath	1
for	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
great	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
acquit	1
the	1
wicked:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
storm,	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
are	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
1:4	1
He	1
rebuketh	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
dry,	1
and	1
drieth	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers:	1
Bashan	1
languisheth,	1
and	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:5	1
The	1
mountains	1
quake	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
melt,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
burned	1
at	1
his	1
presence,	1
yea,	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
1:6	1
Who	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
indignation?	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger?	1
his	1
fury	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
are	1
thrown	1
down	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
good,	1
a	1
strong	1
hold	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble;	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
with	1
an	1
overrunning	1
flood	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
thereof,	1
and	1
darkness	1
shall	1
pursue	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:9	1
What	1
do	1
ye	1
imagine	1
against	1
the	1
LORD?	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end:	1
affliction	1
shall	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
while	1
they	1
be	1
folden	1
together	1
as	1
thorns,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
drunken	1
as	1
drunkards,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
as	1
stubble	1
fully	1
dry.	1
	1
1:11	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
imagineth	1
evil	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
wicked	1
counsellor.	1
	1
1:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Though	1
they	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
likewise	1
many,	1
yet	1
thus	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through.	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
afflict	1
thee	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
burst	1
thy	1
bonds	1
in	1
sunder.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
that	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
sown:	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
gods	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
grave;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
vile.	1
	1
1:15	1
Behold	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
peace!	1
O	1
Judah,	1
keep	1
thy	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
perform	1
thy	1
vows:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
pass	1
through	1
thee;	1
he	1
is	1
utterly	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
2:1	1
He	1
that	1
dasheth	1
in	1
pieces	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
keep	1
the	1
munition,	1
watch	1
the	1
way,	1
make	1
thy	1
loins	1
strong,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
power	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
turned	1
away	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
as	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
emptiers	1
have	1
emptied	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
marred	1
their	1
vine	1
branches.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
shield	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
men	1
is	1
made	1
red,	1
the	1
valiant	1
men	1
are	1
in	1
scarlet:	1
the	1
chariots	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
flaming	1
torches	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
shall	1
be	1
terribly	1
shaken.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
chariots	1
shall	1
rage	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
they	1
shall	1
justle	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
ways:	1
they	1
shall	1
seem	1
like	1
torches,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
the	1
lightnings.	1
	1
2:5	1
He	1
shall	1
recount	1
his	1
worthies:	1
they	1
shall	1
stumble	1
in	1
their	1
walk;	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
palace	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
Huzzab	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
shall	1
lead	1
her	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
doves,	1
tabering	1
upon	1
their	1
breasts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
of	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
water:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
Stand,	1
stand,	1
shall	1
they	1
cry;	1
but	1
none	1
shall	1
look	1
back.	1
	1
2:9	1
Take	1
ye	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
silver,	1
take	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
gold:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
store	1
and	1
glory	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pleasant	1
furniture.	1
	1
2:10	1
She	1
is	1
empty,	1
and	1
void,	1
and	1
waste:	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
melteth,	1
and	1
the	1
knees	1
smite	1
together,	1
and	1
much	1
pain	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
gather	1
blackness.	1
	1
2:11	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
lions,	1
and	1
the	1

of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
where	1
the	1
lion,	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
lion,	1
walked,	1
and	1
the	1
lion's	1
whelp,	1
and	1
none	1
made	1
them	1
afraid?	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
lion	1
did	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
enough	1
for	1
his	1
whelps,	1
and	1
strangled	1
for	1
his	1
lionesses,	1
and	1
filled	1
his	1
holes	1
with	1
prey,	1
and	1
his	1
dens	1
with	1
ravin.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
burn	1
her	1
chariots	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
young	1
lions:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
prey	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
messengers	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
bloody	1
city!	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
lies	1
and	1
robbery;	1
the	1
prey	1
departeth	1
not;	1
3:2	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
whip,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
pransing	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
jumping	1
chariots.	1
	1
3:3	1
The	1
horseman	1
lifteth	1
up	1
both	1
the	1
bright	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
glittering	1
spear:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
slain,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
carcases;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
corpses;	1
they	1
stumble	1
upon	1
their	1
corpses:	1
3:4	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
whoredoms	1
of	1
the	1
wellfavoured	1
harlot,	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
witchcrafts,	1
that	1
selleth	1
nations	1
through	1
her	1
whoredoms,	1
and	1
families	1
through	1
her	1
witchcrafts.	1
	1
3:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
thy	1
skirts	1
upon	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
nations	1
thy	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
thy	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
abominable	1
filth	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
vile,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
gazingstock.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
look	1
upon	1
thee	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
laid	1
waste:	1
who	1
will	1
bemoan	1
her?	1
whence	1
shall	1
I	1
seek	1
comforters	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
3:8	1
Art	1
thou	1
better	1
than	1
populous	1
No,	1
that	1
was	1
situate	1
among	1
the	1
rivers,	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
waters	1
round	1
about	1
it,	1
whose	1
rampart	1
was	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
her	1
wall	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
sea?	1
	1
3:9	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
Egypt	1
were	1
her	1
strength,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
infinite;	1
Put	1
and	1
Lubim	1
were	1
thy	1
helpers.	1
	1
3:10	1
Yet	1
was	1
she	1
carried	1
away,	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
captivity:	1
her	1
young	1
children	1
also	1
were	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
her	1
honourable	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
great	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
chains.	1
	1
3:11	1
Thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
drunken:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
hid,	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
seek	1
strength	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
3:12	1
All	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
fig	1
trees	1
with	1
the	1
firstripe	1
figs:	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
shaken,	1
they	1
shall	1
even	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
eater.	1
	1
3:13	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
are	1
women:	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
wide	1
open	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
bars.	1
	1
3:14	1
Draw	1
thee	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
siege,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
go	1
into	1
clay,	1
and	1
tread	1
the	1
morter,	1
make	1
strong	1
the	1
brickkiln.	1
	1
3:15	1
There	1
shall	1
the	1
fire	1
devour	1
thee;	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
cut	1
thee	1
off,	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
thee	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
cankerworm:	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
locusts.	1
	1
3:16	1
Thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
thy	1
merchants	1
above	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven:	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
spoileth,	1
and	1
fleeth	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Thy	1
crowned	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
locusts,	1
and	1
thy	1
captains	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
grasshoppers,	1
which	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
hedges	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
day,	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
ariseth	1
they	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
their	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
known	1
where	1
they	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Thy	1
shepherds	1
slumber,	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
thy	1
nobles	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
dust:	1
thy	1
people	1
is	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gathereth	1
them.	1
	1
3:19	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
healing	1
of	1
thy	1
bruise;	1
thy	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous:	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
bruit	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
clap	1
the	1
hands	1
over	1
thee:	1
for	1
upon	1
whom	1
hath	1
not	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
passed	1
continually?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Habakkuk	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
which	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
did	1
see.	1
	1
1:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
cry,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hear!	1
even	1
cry	1
out	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
save!	1
	1
1:3	1
Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
shew	1
me	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
behold	1
grievance?	1
for	1
spoiling	1
and	1
violence	1
are	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
that	1
raise	1
up	1
strife	1
and	1
contention.	1
	1
1:4	1
Therefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
slacked,	1
and	1
judgment	1
doth	1
never	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
doth	1
compass	1
about	1
the	1
righteous;	1
therefore	1
wrong	1
judgment	1
proceedeth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Behold	1
ye	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
regard,	1
and	1
wonder	1
marvelously:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days	1
which	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
1:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
bitter	1
and	1
hasty	1
nation,	1
which	1
shall	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
dwellingplaces	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
their's.	1
	1
1:7	1
They	1
are	1
terrible	1
and	1
dreadful:	1
their	1
judgment	1
and	1
their	1
dignity	1
shall	1
proceed	1
of	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:8	1
Their	1
horses	1
also	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
leopards,	1
and	1
are	1
more	1
fierce	1
than	1
the	1
evening	1
wolves:	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
spread	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far;	1
they	1
shall	1
fly	1
as	1
the	1
eagle	1
that	1
hasteth	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
1:9	1
They	1
shall	1
come	1
all	1
for	1
violence:	1
their	1
faces	1
shall	1
sup	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
east	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
the	1
captivity	1
as	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scoff	1
at	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
scorn	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
deride	1
every	1
strong	1
hold;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
heap	1
dust,	1
and	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
his	1
mind	1
change,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
over,	1
and	1
offend,	1
imputing	1
this	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
everlasting,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
mine	1
Holy	1
One?	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
ordained	1
them	1
for	1
judgment;	1
and,	1
O	1
mighty	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
them	1
for	1
correction.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
art	1
of	1
purer	1
eyes	1
than	1
to	1
behold	1
evil,	1
and	1
canst	1
not	1
look	1
on	1
iniquity:	1
wherefore	1
lookest	1
thou	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
deal	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
holdest	1
thy	1
tongue	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
devoureth	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
he?	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
makest	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
the	1
creeping	1
things,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
ruler	1
over	1
them?	1
	1
1:15	1
They	1
take	1
up	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
angle,	1
they	1
catch	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
drag:	1
therefore	1
they	1
rejoice	1
and	1
are	1
glad.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
their	1
drag;	1
because	1
by	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
is	1
fat,	1
and	1
their	1
meat	1
plenteous.	1
	1
1:17	1
Shall	1
they	1
therefore	1
empty	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
continually	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
upon	1
my	1
watch,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
will	1
watch	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
reproved.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
Write	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
plain	1
upon	1
tables,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
run	1
that	1
readeth	1
it.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
an	1
appointed	1
time,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
shall	1
speak,	1
and	1
not	1
lie:	1
though	1
it	1
tarry,	1
wait	1
for	1
it;	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
surely	1
come,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
2:4	1
Behold,	1
his	1
soul	1
which	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
is	1
not	1
upright	1
in	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
his	1
faith.	1
	1
2:5	1
Yea	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
transgresseth	1
by	1
wine,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
proud	1
man,	1
neither	1
keepeth	1
at	1
home,	1
who	1
enlargeth	1
his	1
desire	1
as	1
hell,	1
and	1
is	1
as	1
death,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
but	1
gathereth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
heapeth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
people:	1
2:6	1
Shall	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
taunting	1
proverb	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
say,	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
increaseth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
his!	1
how	1
long?	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ladeth	1
himself	1
with	1
thick	1
clay!	1
	1
2:7	1
Shall	1
they	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
suddenly	1
that	1
shall	1
bite	1
thee,	1
and	1
awake	1
that	1
shall	1
vex	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
for	1
booties	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
2:8	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoiled	1
many	1
nations,	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
thee;	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:9	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
coveteth	1
an	1
evil	1
covetousness	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
set	1
his	1
nest	1
on	1
high,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
evil!	1
	1
2:10	1
Thou	1
hast	1
consulted	1
shame	1
to	1
thy	1
house	1
by	1
cutting	1
off	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
sinned	1
against	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
stone	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
timber	1
shall	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
2:12	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
buildeth	1
a	1
town	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
stablisheth	1
a	1
city	1
by	1
iniquity!	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
weary	1
themselves	1
for	1
very	1
vanity?	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
2:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
giveth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
drink,	1
that	1
puttest	1
thy	1
bottle	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
makest	1
him	1
drunken	1
also,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
look	1
on	1
their	1
nakedness!	1
	1
2:16	1
Thou	1
art	1
filled	1
with	1
shame	1
for	1
glory:	1
drink	1
thou	1
also,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
foreskin	1
be	1
uncovered:	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shameful	1
spewing	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
beasts,	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
afraid,	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:18	1
What	1
profiteth	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof	1
hath	1
graven	1
it;	1
the	1
molten	1
image,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
lies,	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
trusteth	1
therein,	1
to	1
make	1
dumb	1
idols?	1
	1
2:19	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
wood,	1
Awake;	1
to	1
the	1
dumb	1
stone,	1
Arise,	1
it	1
shall	1
teach!	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
laid	1
over	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
temple:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
keep	1
silence	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
A	1
prayer	1
of	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
upon	1
Shigionoth.	1
	1
3:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
speech,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
revive	1
thy	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
make	1
known;	1
in	1
wrath	1
remember	1
mercy.	1
	1
3:3	1
God	1
came	1
from	1
Teman,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
from	1
mount	1
Paran.	1
Selah.	1
His	1
glory	1
covered	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
praise.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
his	1
brightness	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
light;	1
he	1
had	1
horns	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
hiding	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:5	1
Before	1
him	1
went	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
burning	1
coals	1
went	1
forth	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
stood,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
beheld,	1
and	1
drove	1
asunder	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
the	1
everlasting	1
mountains	1
were	1
scattered,	1
the	1
perpetual	1
hills	1
did	1
bow:	1
his	1
ways	1
are	1
everlasting.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Cushan	1
in	1
affliction:	1
and	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian	1
did	1
tremble.	1
	1
3:8	1
Was	1
the	1
LORD	1
displeased	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thine	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thy	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
ride	1
upon	1
thine	1
horses	1
and	1
thy	1
chariots	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
3:9	1
Thy	1
bow	1
was	1
made	1
quite	1
naked,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
oaths	1
of	1
the	1
tribes,	1
even	1
thy	1
word.	1
Selah.	1
Thou	1
didst	1
cleave	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
rivers.	1
	1
3:10	1
The	1
mountains	1
saw	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
trembled:	1
the	1
overflowing	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
passed	1
by:	1
the	1
deep	1
uttered	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
habitation:	1
at	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thine	1
arrows	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shining	1
of	1
thy	1
glittering	1
spear.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thou	1
didst	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
indignation,	1
thou	1
didst	1
thresh	1
the	1
heathen	1
in	1
anger.	1
	1
3:13	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
forth	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
even	1
for	1
salvation	1
with	1
thine	1
anointed;	1
thou	1
woundedst	1
the	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
by	1
discovering	1
the	1
foundation	1
unto	1
the	1
neck.	1
Selah.	1
	1
3:14	1
Thou	1
didst	1
strike	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
staves	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
villages:	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
to	1
scatter	1
me:	1
their	1
rejoicing	1
was	1
as	1
to	1
devour	1
the	1
poor	1
secretly.	1
	1
3:15	1
Thou	1
didst	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
thine	1
horses,	1
through	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
great	1
waters.	1
	1
3:16	1
When	1
I	1
heard,	1
my	1
belly	1
trembled;	1
my	1
lips	1
quivered	1
at	1
the	1
voice:	1
rottenness	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
I	1
trembled	1
in	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble:	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
will	1
invade	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
troops.	1
	1
3:17	1
Although	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
shall	1
not	1
blossom,	1
neither	1
shall	1
fruit	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
vines;	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
shall	1
fail,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meat;	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
fold,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
herd	1
in	1
the	1
stalls:	1
3:18	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
3:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
feet	1
like	1
hinds'	1
feet,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
walk	1
upon	1
mine	1
high	1
places.	1
To	1
the	1
chief	1
singer	1
on	1
my	1
stringed	1
instruments.	1
	1

	1
	1
Zephaniah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cushi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gedaliah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hizkiah,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
consume	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
stumbling	1
blocks	1
with	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Baal	1
from	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Chemarims	1
with	1
the	1
priests;	1
1:5	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops;	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
Malcham;	1
1:6	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
enquired	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prepared	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
he	1
hath	1
bid	1
his	1
guests.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
sacrifice,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
strange	1
apparel.	1
	1
1:9	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
punish	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
leap	1
on	1
the	1
threshold,	1
which	1
fill	1
their	1
masters'	1
houses	1
with	1
violence	1
and	1
deceit.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
fish	1
gate,	1
and	1
an	1
howling	1
from	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
crashing	1
from	1
the	1
hills.	1
	1
1:11	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Maktesh,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
merchant	1
people	1
are	1
cut	1
down;	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
bear	1
silver	1
are	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
candles,	1
and	1
punish	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
settled	1
on	1
their	1
lees:	1
that	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
good,	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
1:13	1
Therefore	1
their	1
goods	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
booty,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
build	1
houses,	1
but	1
not	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
not	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:14	1
The	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near,	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
and	1
hasteth	1
greatly,	1
even	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
shall	1
cry	1
there	1
bitterly.	1
	1
1:15	1
That	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wrath,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
distress,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wasteness	1
and	1
desolation,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
1:16	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
and	1
alarm	1
against	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
high	1
towers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
distress	1
upon	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
like	1
blind	1
men,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
as	1
dust,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
as	1
the	1
dung.	1
	1
1:18	1
Neither	1
their	1
silver	1
nor	1
their	1
gold	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
wrath;	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
his	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
even	1
a	1
speedy	1
riddance	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
2:1	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
yea,	1
gather	1
together,	1
O	1
nation	1
not	1
desired;	1
2:2	1
Before	1
the	1
decree	1
bring	1
forth,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
pass	1
as	1
the	1
chaff,	1
before	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
2:3	1
Seek	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
his	1
judgment;	1
seek	1
righteousness,	1
seek	1
meekness:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
Gaza	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
Ashdod	1
at	1
the	1
noon	1
day,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
2:5	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Cherethites!	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
against	1
you;	1
O	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
dwellings	1
and	1
cottages	1
for	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
folds	1
for	1
flocks.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah;	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
thereupon:	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
they	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
evening:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
visit	1
them,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
captivity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
revilings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Surely	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
as	1
Gomorrah,	1
even	1
the	1
breeding	1
of	1
nettles,	1
and	1
saltpits,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
desolation:	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
possess	1
them.	1
	1
2:10	1
This	1
shall	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
pride,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
terrible	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
famish	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
men	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
place,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:12	1
Ye	1
Ethiopians	1
also,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
my	1
sword.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
Nineveh	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
dry	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
flocks	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her,	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
both	1
the	1
cormorant	1
and	1
the	1
bittern	1
shall	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
lintels	1
of	1
it;	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
windows;	1
desolation	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
thresholds;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
uncover	1
the	1
cedar	1
work.	1
	1
2:15	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
city	1
that	1
dwelt	1
carelessly,	1
that	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me:	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
become	1
a	1
desolation,	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
beasts	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in!	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
by	1
her	1
shall	1
hiss,	1
and	1
wag	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
filthy	1
and	1
polluted,	1
to	1
the	1
oppressing	1
city!	1
3:2	1
She	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice;	1
she	1
received	1
not	1
correction;	1
she	1
trusted	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
she	1
drew	1
not	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Her	1
princes	1
within	1
her	1
are	1
roaring	1
lions;	1
her	1
judges	1
are	1
evening	1
wolves;	1
they	1
gnaw	1
not	1
the	1
bones	1
till	1
the	1
morrow.	1
	1
3:4	1
Her	1
prophets	1
are	1
light	1
and	1
treacherous	1
persons:	1
her	1
priests	1
have	1
polluted	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
The	1
just	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity:	1
every	1
morning	1
doth	1
he	1
bring	1
his	1
judgment	1
to	1
light,	1
he	1
faileth	1
not;	1
but	1
the	1
unjust	1
knoweth	1
no	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
nations:	1
their	1
towers	1
are	1
desolate;	1
I	1
made	1
their	1
streets	1
waste,	1
that	1
none	1
passeth	1
by:	1
their	1
cities	1
are	1
destroyed,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fear	1
me,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
receive	1
instruction;	1
so	1
their	1
dwelling	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
howsoever	1
I	1
punished	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
corrupted	1
all	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:8	1
Therefore	1
wait	1
ye	1
upon	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
rise	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prey:	1
for	1
my	1
determination	1
is	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
nations,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
assemble	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
pour	1
upon	1
them	1
mine	1
indignation,	1
even	1
all	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
jealousy.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
pure	1
language,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
all	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
consent.	1
	1
3:10	1
From	1
beyond	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
my	1
suppliants,	1
even	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
dispersed,	1
shall	1
bring	1
mine	1
offering.	1
	1
3:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
doings,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
pride,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
haughty	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
3:12	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
an	1
afflicted	1
and	1
poor	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity,	1
nor	1
speak	1
lies;	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
deceitful	1
tongue	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
their	1
mouth:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
and	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
3:14	1
Sing,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
out	1
thine	1
enemy:	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
evil	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:16	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not:	1
and	1
to	1
Zion,	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
slack.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
is	1
mighty;	1
he	1
will	1
save,	1
he	1
will	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
joy;	1
he	1
will	1
rest	1
in	1
his	1
love,	1
he	1
will	1
joy	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
singing.	1
	1
3:18	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sorrowful	1
for	1
the	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
thee,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burden.	1
	1
3:19	1
Behold,	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
undo	1
all	1
that	1
afflict	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
driven	1
out;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
them	1
praise	1
and	1
fame	1
in	1
every	1
land	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
3:20	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
again,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
gather	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
a	1
praise	1
among	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
when	1
I	1
turn	1
back	1
your	1
captivity	1
before	1
your	1
eyes,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1

Haggai	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king,	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
This	1
people	1
say,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
come,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
should	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
1:3	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:4	1
Is	1
it	1
time	1
for	1
you,	1
O	1
ye,	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
cieled	1
houses,	1
and	1
this	1
house	1
lie	1
waste?	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
sown	1
much,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
little;	1
ye	1
eat,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
enough;	1
ye	1
drink,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
drink;	1
ye	1
clothe	1
you,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
warm;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
earneth	1
wages	1
earneth	1
wages	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bag	1
with	1
holes.	1
	1
1:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:8	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
bring	1
wood,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Ye	1
looked	1
for	1
much,	1
and,	1
lo	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
little;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
brought	1
it	1
home,	1
I	1
did	1
blow	1
upon	1
it.	1
Why?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
Because	1
of	1
mine	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
waste,	1
and	1
ye	1
run	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
heaven	1
over	1
you	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
dew,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
drought	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
ground	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
and	1
upon	1
men,	1
and	1
upon	1
cattle,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
hands.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
spake	1
Haggai	1
the	1
LORD's	1
messenger	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
message	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
their	1
God,	1
1:15	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:1	1
In	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Haggai,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Speak	1
now	1
to	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
2:3	1
Who	1
is	1
left	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
saw	1
this	1
house	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
glory?	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
ye	1
see	1
it	1
now?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
nothing?	1
	1
2:4	1
Yet	1
now	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Joshua,	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
all	1
ye	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
work:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
2:5	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
covenanted	1
with	1
you	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
my	1
spirit	1
remaineth	1
among	1
you:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
2:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Yet	1
once,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land;	1
2:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
this	1
house	1
with	1
glory,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
silver	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
is	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
latter	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:10	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Ask	1
now	1
the	1
priests	1
concerning	1
the	1
law,	1
saying,	1
2:12	1
If	1
one	1
bear	1
holy	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
skirt	1
do	1
touch	1
bread,	1
or	1
pottage,	1
or	1
wine,	1
or	1
oil,	1
or	1
any	1
meat,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
holy?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
No.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Haggai,	1
If	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
unclean	1
by	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
touch	1
any	1
of	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
unclean?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Haggai,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
this	1
nation	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
there	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
consider	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
before	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
laid	1
upon	1
a	1
stone	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
2:16	1
Since	1
those	1
days	1
were,	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
twenty	1
measures,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
ten:	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pressfat	1
for	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
fifty	1
vessels	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
twenty.	1
	1
2:17	1
I	1
smote	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
with	1
mildew	1
and	1
with	1
hail	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
your	1
hands;	1
yet	1
ye	1
turned	1
not	1
to	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:18	1
Consider	1
now	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
temple	1
was	1
laid,	1
consider	1
it.	1
	1
2:19	1
Is	1
the	1
seed	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
barn?	1
yea,	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranate,	1
and	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
hath	1
not	1
brought	1
forth:	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
you.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Haggai	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
saying,	1
2:21	1
Speak	1
to	1
Zerubbabel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
ride	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
their	1
riders	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
2:23	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
will	1
I	1
take	1
thee,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
my	1
servant,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
signet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Zechariah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:3	1
Therefore	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:4	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
former	1
prophets	1
have	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
now	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways,	1
and	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
doings:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
Your	1
fathers,	1
where	1
are	1
they?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
do	1
they	1
live	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
said,	1
Like	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
doings,	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
dealt	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:7	1
Upon	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Sebat,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:8	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
riding	1
upon	1
a	1
red	1
horse,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
behind	1
him	1
were	1
there	1
red	1
horses,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
white.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
what	1
are	1
these?	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
these	1
be.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
sitteth	1
still,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
rest.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
against	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
indignation	1
these	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
years?	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
comfortable	1
words.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
communed	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cry	1
thou,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
jealousy.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease:	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
displeased,	1
and	1
they	1
helped	1
forward	1
the	1
affliction.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
mercies:	1
my	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
shall	1
be	1
stretched	1
forth	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:17	1
Cry	1
yet,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
My	1
cities	1
through	1
prosperity	1
shall	1
yet	1
be	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
yet	1
comfort	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
yet	1
choose	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
four	1
horns.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
be	1
these?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
me	1
four	1
carpenters.	1
	1
1:21	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
What	1
come	1
these	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
did	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
head:	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
fray	1
them,	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
horn	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
scatter	1
it.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
again,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
measuring	1
line	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
measure	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
length	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
another	1
angel	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
2:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Run,	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
as	1
towns	1
without	1
walls	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
cattle	1
therein:	1
2:5	1
For	1
I,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
her	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
fire	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
2:6	1
Ho,	1
ho,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spread	1
you	1
abroad	1
as	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:7	1
Deliver	1
thyself,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
After	1
the	1
glory	1
hath	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
spoiled	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
you	1
toucheth	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
2:9	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
their	1
servants:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
Sing	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
inherit	1
Judah	1
his	1
portion	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
choose	1
Jerusalem	1
again.	1
	1
2:13	1
Be	1
silent,	1
O	1
all	1
flesh,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
raised	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Satan	1
standing	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
resist	1
him.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
The	1
LORD	1
rebuke	1
thee,	1
O	1
Satan;	1
even	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Jerusalem	1
rebuke	1
thee:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
brand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
	1
3:3	1
Now	1
Joshua	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
filthy	1
garments,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
filthy	1
garments	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
clothe	1
thee	1
with	1
change	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
So	1
they	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
garments.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
by.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
protested	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
3:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
my	1
charge,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
judge	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
shalt	1
also	1
keep	1
my	1
courts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
places	1
to	1
walk	1
among	1
these	1
that	1
stand	1
by.	1
	1
3:8	1
Hear	1
now,	1
O	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
fellows	1
that	1
sit	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
men	1
wondered	1
at:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
servant	1
the	1
BRANCH.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
before	1
Joshua;	1
upon	1
one	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
eyes:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
engrave	1
the	1
graving	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
ye	1
call	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour	1
under	1
the	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
waked	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
wakened	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
candlestick	1
all	1
of	1
gold,	1
with	1
a	1
bowl	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
seven	1
lamps	1
thereon,	1
and	1
seven	1
pipes	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
lamps,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof:	1
4:3	1
And	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
by	1
it,	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bowl,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:6	1
Then	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
by	1
might,	1
nor	1
by	1
power,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
spirit,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
4:7	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
great	1
mountain?	1
before	1
Zerubbabel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
become	1
a	1
plain:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
headstone	1
thereof	1
with	1
shoutings,	1
crying,	1
Grace,	1
grace	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:8	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
this	1
house;	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
also	1
finish	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
small	1
things?	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
plummet	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
with	1
those	1
seven;	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
answered	1
I,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
be	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
branches	1
which	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
golden	1
pipes	1
empty	1
the	1
golden	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
themselves?	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
and	1
said,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:14	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
anointed	1
ones,	1
that	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
flying	1
roll.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
flying	1
roll;	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
is	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
ten	1
cubits.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
curse	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
stealeth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
sweareth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
5:4	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
forth,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
thief,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sweareth	1
falsely	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
timber	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
ephah	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
This	1
is	1
their	1
resemblance	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
lead:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
wickedness.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah;	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
lead	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
two	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
wings;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
wings	1
like	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
stork:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
ephah	1
between	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
Whither	1
do	1
these	1
bear	1
the	1
ephah?	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
build	1
it	1
an	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
established,	1
and	1
set	1
there	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
base.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
four	1
chariots	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
two	1
mountains;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
mountains	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
6:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
chariot	1
were	1
red	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
black	1
horses;	1
6:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
chariot	1
white	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
chariot	1
grisled	1
and	1
bay	1
horses.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
four	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
heavens,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:6	1
The	1
black	1
horses	1
which	1
are	1
therein	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
north	1
country;	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
go	1
forth	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
grisled	1
go	1
forth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
country.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
bay	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Get	1
you	1
hence,	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
So	1
they	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:8	1
Then	1
cried	1
he	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
that	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
country	1
have	1
quieted	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
country.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
6:10	1
Take	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
even	1
of	1
Heldai,	1
of	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
of	1
Jedaiah,	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
come	1
thou	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah;	1
6:11	1
Then	1
take	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
make	1
crowns,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
6:12	1
And	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
BRANCH;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:13	1
Even	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
and	1
rule	1
upon	1
his	1
throne;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
upon	1
his	1
throne:	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
between	1
them	1
both.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
crowns	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
Helem,	1
and	1
to	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
to	1
Jedaiah,	1
and	1
to	1
Hen	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
build	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
diligently	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Darius,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
in	1
Chisleu;	1
7:2	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
Sherezer	1
and	1
Regemmelech,	1
and	1
their	1
men,	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
7:3	1
And	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Should	1
I	1
weep	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
separating	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
so	1
many	1
years?	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
When	1
ye	1
fasted	1
and	1
mourned	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
and	1
seventh	1
month,	1
even	1
those	1
seventy	1
years,	1
did	1
ye	1
at	1
all	1
fast	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
drink,	1
did	1
not	1
ye	1
eat	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
drink	1
for	1
yourselves?	1
7:7	1
Should	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets,	1
when	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
inhabited	1
and	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
round	1
about	1
her,	1
when	1
men	1
inhabited	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
the	1
plain?	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
saying,	1
7:9	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Execute	1
true	1
judgment,	1
and	1
shew	1
mercy	1
and	1
compassions	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
brother:	1
7:10	1
And	1
oppress	1
not	1
the	1
widow,	1
nor	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
the	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
against	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
7:11	1
But	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
hearken,	1
and	1
pulled	1
away	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
7:12	1
Yea,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
hearts	1
as	1
an	1
adamant	1
stone,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets:	1
therefore	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
wrath	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
so	1
they	1
cried,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
7:14	1
But	1
I	1
scattered	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not.	1
Thus	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
desolate	1
after	1
them,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
passed	1
through	1
nor	1
returned:	1
for	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land	1
desolate.	1
	1
8:1	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
great	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
fury.	1
	1
8:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
and	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
8:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
There	1
shall	1
yet	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
old	1
women	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
very	1
age.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
playing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
thereof.	1
	1
8:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
these	1
days,	1
should	1
it	1
also	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
country;	1
8:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong,	1
ye	1
that	1
hear	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
these	1
words	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
laid,	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
might	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hire	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
any	1
hire	1
for	1
beast;	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
or	1
came	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
affliction:	1
for	1
I	1
set	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
the	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
prosperous;	1
the	1
vine	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
the	1
ground	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
dew;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
possess	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
a	1
curse	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
blessing:	1
fear	1
not,	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
As	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
punish	1
you,	1
when	1
your	1
fathers	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
wrath,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
repented	1
not:	1
8:15	1
So	1
again	1
have	1
I	1
thought	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
8:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do;	1
Speak	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
execute	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
gates:	1
8:17	1
And	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
love	1
no	1
false	1
oath:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
hate,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:19	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
The	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fifth,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
seventh,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
tenth,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
cheerful	1
feasts;	1
therefore	1
love	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:20	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
It	1
shall	1
yet	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
many	1
cities:	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
one	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
another,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
speedily	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
also.	1
	1
8:22	1
Yea,	1
many	1
people	1
and	1
strong	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
ten	1
men	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
languages	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
even	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hadrach,	1
and	1
Damascus	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
rest	1
thereof:	1
when	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
as	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
toward	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
Hamath	1
also	1
shall	1
border	1
thereby;	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
very	1
wise.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
Tyrus	1
did	1
build	1
herself	1
a	1
strong	1
hold,	1
and	1
heaped	1
up	1
silver	1
as	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
fine	1
gold	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
9:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
her	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
9:5	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
fear;	1
Gaza	1
also	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
Ekron;	1
for	1
her	1
expectation	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
inhabited.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
a	1
bastard	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
abominations	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
teeth:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth,	1
even	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
governor	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
as	1
a	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
encamp	1
about	1
mine	1
house	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
passeth	1
by,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
returneth:	1
and	1
no	1
oppressor	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
with	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:9	1
Rejoice	1
greatly,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee:	1
he	1
is	1
just,	1
and	1
having	1
salvation;	1
lowly,	1
and	1
riding	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
upon	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
chariot	1
from	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
peace	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen:	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
from	1
sea	1
even	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
thee	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
forth	1
thy	1
prisoners	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
9:12	1
Turn	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
strong	1
hold,	1
ye	1
prisoners	1
of	1
hope:	1
even	1
to	1
day	1
do	1
I	1
declare	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
double	1
unto	1
thee;	1
9:13	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
bent	1
Judah	1
for	1
me,	1
filled	1
the	1
bow	1
with	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
raised	1
up	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
against	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Greece,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
arrow	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
lightning:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
shall	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
defend	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour,	1
and	1
subdue	1
with	1
sling	1
stones;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
through	1
wine;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
like	1
bowls,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
save	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
a	1
crown,	1
lifted	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
ensign	1
upon	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
beauty!	1
corn	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
the	1
maids.	1
	1
10:1	1
Ask	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
rain;	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
bright	1
clouds,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
showers	1
of	1
rain,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
the	1
idols	1
have	1
spoken	1
vanity,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
have	1
told	1
false	1
dreams;	1
they	1
comfort	1
in	1
vain:	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way	1
as	1
a	1
flock,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:3	1
Mine	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
I	1
punished	1
the	1
goats:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
flock	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
as	1
his	1
goodly	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
10:4	1
Out	1
of	1
him	1
came	1
forth	1
the	1
corner,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
nail,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
battle	1
bow,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
every	1
oppressor	1
together.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
mighty	1
men,	1
which	1
tread	1
down	1
their	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
the	1
battle:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
riders	1
on	1
horses	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
place	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
off:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
as	1
through	1
wine:	1
yea,	1
their	1
children	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
glad;	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:8	1
I	1
will	1
hiss	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
gather	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
increase	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
increased.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
far	1
countries;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
turn	1
again.	1
	1
10:10	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
place	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
affliction,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
deeps	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
dry	1
up:	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Assyria	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
depart	1
away.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:1	1
Open	1
thy	1
doors,	1
O	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
may	1
devour	1
thy	1
cedars.	1
	1
11:2	1
Howl,	1
fir	1
tree;	1
for	1
the	1
cedar	1
is	1
fallen;	1
because	1
the	1
mighty	1
are	1
spoiled:	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
oaks	1
of	1
Bashan;	1
for	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
vintage	1
is	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
11:3	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds;	1
for	1
their	1
glory	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
young	1
lions;	1
for	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Jordan	1
is	1
spoiled.	1
	1
11:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God;	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
11:5	1
Whose	1
possessors	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
hold	1
themselves	1
not	1
guilty:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sell	1
them	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
rich:	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
shepherds	1
pity	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
pity	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
hand,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
king:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
slaughter,	1
even	1
you,	1
O	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
staves;	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
called	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
called	1
Bands;	1
and	1
I	1
fed	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
11:8	1
Three	1
shepherds	1
also	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
month;	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
lothed	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
also	1
abhorred	1
me.	1
	1
11:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
feed	1
you:	1
that	1
that	1
dieth,	1
let	1
it	1
die;	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
rest	1
eat	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
staff,	1
even	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
asunder,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
that	1
waited	1
upon	1
me	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
think	1
good,	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
price;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
forbear.	1
So	1
they	1
weighed	1
for	1
my	1
price	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
potter:	1
a	1
goodly	1
price	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
prised	1
at	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
potter	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
I	1
cut	1
asunder	1
mine	1
other	1
staff,	1
even	1
Bands,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
between	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
unto	1
thee	1
yet	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
a	1
foolish	1
shepherd.	1
	1
11:16	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
shepherd	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
visit	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
neither	1
shall	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
one,	1
nor	1
heal	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
broken,	1
nor	1
feed	1
that	1
that	1
standeth	1
still:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
tear	1
their	1
claws	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
11:17	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
idol	1
shepherd	1
that	1
leaveth	1
the	1
flock!	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
eye:	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
clean	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
darkened.	1
	1
12:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
stretcheth	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
layeth	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
formeth	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
12:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
both	1
against	1
Judah	1
and	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
burdensome	1
stone	1
for	1
all	1
people:	1
all	1
that	1
burden	1
themselves	1
with	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
12:4	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
with	1
madness:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
blindness.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
12:6	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
like	1
an	1
hearth	1
of	1
fire	1
among	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
torch	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
sheaf;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
place,	1
even	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Judah	1
first,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
do	1
not	1
magnify	1
themselves	1
against	1
Judah.	1
	1
12:8	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
defend	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
feeble	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
God,	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
supplications:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
pierced,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
mourn	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
mourneth	1
for	1
his	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
his	1
firstborn.	1
	1
12:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
mourning	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Hadadrimmon	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Megiddon.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
every	1
family	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nathan	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:13	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Shimei	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:14	1
All	1
the	1
families	1
that	1
remain,	1
every	1
family	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart.	1
	1
13:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fountain	1
opened	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
sin	1
and	1
for	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
idols	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered:	1
and	1
also	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
shall	1
yet	1
prophesy,	1
then	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
live;	1
for	1
thou	1
speakest	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
thrust	1
him	1
through	1
when	1
he	1
prophesieth.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vision,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
prophesied;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
wear	1
a	1
rough	1
garment	1
to	1
deceive:	1
13:5	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
prophet,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
husbandman;	1
for	1
man	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
cattle	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
one	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
wounds	1
in	1
thine	1
hands?	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Those	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
friends.	1
	1
13:7	1
Awake,	1
O	1
sword,	1
against	1
my	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
fellow,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
two	1
parts	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
die;	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
therein.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
will	1
refine	1
them	1
as	1
silver	1
is	1
refined,	1
and	1
will	1
try	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
is	1
tried:	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
them:	1
I	1
will	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
14:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
and	1
thy	1
spoil	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
nations	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
battle;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
rifled,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
ravished;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
14:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
those	1
nations,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
shall	1
cleave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
valley;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
shall	1
remove	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
toward	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
for	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
Azal:	1
yea,	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee,	1
like	1
as	1
ye	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
clear,	1
nor	1
dark:	1
14:7	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
not	1
day,	1
nor	1
night:	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
evening	1
time	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
light.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
living	1
waters	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
former	1
sea,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
hinder	1
sea:	1
in	1
summer	1
and	1
in	1
winter	1
shall	1
it	1
be.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
one	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
one.	1
	1
14:10	1
All	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
as	1
a	1
plain	1
from	1
Geba	1
to	1
Rimmon	1
south	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
inhabited	1
in	1
her	1
place,	1
from	1
Benjamin's	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
gate,	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
winepresses.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
men	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
utter	1
destruction;	1
but	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
safely	1
inhabited.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem;	1
Their	1
flesh	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
while	1
they	1
stand	1
upon	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
holes,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
tumult	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hold	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fight	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
apparel,	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
so	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
horse,	1
of	1
the	1
mule,	1
of	1
the	1
camel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
these	1
tents,	1
as	1
this	1
plague.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
came	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
even	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whoso	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
even	1
upon	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
rain.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Egypt	1
go	1
not	1
up,	1
and	1
come	1
not,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
rain;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:19	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:20	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
HOLINESS	1
UNTO	1
THE	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
pots	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
bowls	1
before	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
14:21	1
Yea,	1
every	1
pot	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
in	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
seethe	1
therein:	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Malachi	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Israel	1
by	1
Malachi.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
hast	1
thou	1
loved	1
us?	1
Was	1
not	1
Esau	1
Jacob's	1
brother?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
yet	1
I	1
loved	1
Jacob,	1
1:3	1
And	1
I	1
hated	1
Esau,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
mountains	1
and	1
his	1
heritage	1
waste	1
for	1
the	1
dragons	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:4	1
Whereas	1
Edom	1
saith,	1
We	1
are	1
impoverished,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
desolate	1
places;	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
They	1
shall	1
build,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
throw	1
down;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
them,	1
The	1
border	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
and,	1
The	1
people	1
against	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
indignation	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
your	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
magnified	1
from	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:6	1
A	1
son	1
honoureth	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
his	1
master:	1
if	1
then	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
father,	1
where	1
is	1
mine	1
honour?	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
master,	1
where	1
is	1
my	1
fear?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
you,	1
O	1
priests,	1
that	1
despise	1
my	1
name.	1
And	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
despised	1
thy	1
name?	1
	1
1:7	1
Ye	1
offer	1
polluted	1
bread	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
polluted	1
thee?	1
In	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
blind	1
for	1
sacrifice,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
lame	1
and	1
sick,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
offer	1
it	1
now	1
unto	1
thy	1
governor;	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thee,	1
or	1
accept	1
thy	1
person?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
beseech	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
us:	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
by	1
your	1
means:	1
will	1
he	1
regard	1
your	1
persons?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:10	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
even	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
would	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
for	1
nought?	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
kindle	1
fire	1
on	1
mine	1
altar	1
for	1
nought.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
accept	1
an	1
offering	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
incense	1
shall	1
be	1
offered	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
a	1
pure	1
offering:	1
for	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
profaned	1
it,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
polluted;	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
even	1
his	1
meat,	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:13	1
Ye	1
said	1
also,	1
Behold,	1
what	1
a	1
weariness	1
is	1
it!	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
snuffed	1
at	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
ye	1
brought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn,	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
and	1
the	1
sick;	1
thus	1
ye	1
brought	1
an	1
offering:	1
should	1
I	1
accept	1
this	1
of	1
your	1
hand?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
But	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
deceiver,	1
which	1
hath	1
in	1
his	1
flock	1
a	1
male,	1
and	1
voweth,	1
and	1
sacrificeth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
corrupt	1
thing:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
great	1
King,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
dreadful	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
ye	1
priests,	1
this	1
commandment	1
is	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
2:2	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart,	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
send	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
curse	1
your	1
blessings:	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
cursed	1
them	1
already,	1
because	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
2:3	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
corrupt	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
spread	1
dung	1
upon	1
your	1
faces,	1
even	1
the	1
dung	1
of	1
your	1
solemn	1
feasts;	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
this	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
covenant	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:5	1
My	1
covenant	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
peace;	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
wherewith	1
he	1
feared	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
before	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
truth	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
iniquity	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
lips:	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
equity,	1
and	1
did	1
turn	1
many	1
away	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
priest's	1
lips	1
should	1
keep	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
law	1
at	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
ye	1
have	1
caused	1
many	1
to	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
have	1
corrupted	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
made	1
you	1
contemptible	1
and	1
base	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
ways,	1
but	1
have	1
been	1
partial	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:10	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
all	1
one	1
father?	1
hath	1
not	1
one	1
God	1
created	1
us?	1
why	1
do	1
we	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
every	1
man	1
against	1
his	1
brother,	1
by	1
profaning	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
our	1
fathers?	1
	1
2:11	1
Judah	1
hath	1
dealt	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
an	1
abomination	1
is	1
committed	1
in	1
Israel	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
Judah	1
hath	1
profaned	1
the	1
holiness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
loved,	1
and	1
hath	1
married	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
god.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this,	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
scholar,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
this	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
again,	1
covering	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
tears,	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
crying	1
out,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
offering	1
any	1
more,	1
or	1
receiveth	1
it	1
with	1
good	1
will	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
2:14	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
witness	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
against	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
treacherously:	1
yet	1
is	1
she	1
thy	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
make	1
one?	1
Yet	1
had	1
he	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
spirit.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
one?	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
seek	1
a	1
godly	1
seed.	1
Therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
that	1
he	1
hateth	1
putting	1
away:	1
for	1
one	1
covereth	1
violence	1
with	1
his	1
garment,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
deal	1
not	1
treacherously.	1
	1
2:17	1
Ye	1
have	1
wearied	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
your	1
words.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
wearied	1
him?	1
When	1
ye	1
say,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
them;	1
or,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
temple,	1
even	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
whom	1
ye	1
delight	1
in:	1
behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:2	1
But	1
who	1
may	1
abide	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
stand	1
when	1
he	1
appeareth?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
refiner's	1
fire,	1
and	1
like	1
fullers'	1
soap:	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
refiner	1
and	1
purifier	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
purge	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
pleasant	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
years.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
swift	1
witness	1
against	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
adulterers,	1
and	1
against	1
false	1
swearers,	1
and	1
against	1
those	1
that	1
oppress	1
the	1
hireling	1
in	1
his	1
wages,	1
the	1
widow,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
that	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
stranger	1
from	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
change	1
not;	1
therefore	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
are	1
not	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:7	1
Even	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
them.	1
Return	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
But	1
ye	1
said,	1
Wherein	1
shall	1
we	1
return?	1
	1
3:8	1
Will	1
a	1
man	1
rob	1
God?	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me.	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
robbed	1
thee?	1
In	1
tithes	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
3:9	1
Ye	1
are	1
cursed	1
with	1
a	1
curse:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me,	1
even	1
this	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
3:10	1
Bring	1
ye	1
all	1
the	1
tithes	1
into	1
the	1
storehouse,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
meat	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
prove	1
me	1
now	1
herewith,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
if	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
you	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
pour	1
you	1
out	1
a	1
blessing,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
room	1
enough	1
to	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
rebuke	1
the	1
devourer	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
ground;	1
neither	1
shall	1
your	1
vine	1
cast	1
her	1
fruit	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
blessed:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
delightsome	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:13	1
Your	1
words	1
have	1
been	1
stout	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
spoken	1
so	1
much	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
3:14	1
Ye	1
have	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
serve	1
God:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
kept	1
his	1
ordinance,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
walked	1
mournfully	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
proud	1
happy;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
work	1
wickedness	1
are	1
set	1
up;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
tempt	1
God	1
are	1
even	1
delivered.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
often	1
one	1
to	1
another:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
remembrance	1
was	1
written	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
upon	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
jewels;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
spareth	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
that	1
serveth	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
return,	1
and	1
discern	1
between	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked,	1
between	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
God	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
day	1
cometh,	1
that	1
shall	1
burn	1
as	1
an	1
oven;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proud,	1
yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
shall	1
be	1
stubble:	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
up,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
neither	1
root	1
nor	1
branch.	1
	1
4:2	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
fear	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Sun	1
of	1
righteousness	1
arise	1
with	1
healing	1
in	1
his	1
wings;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
grow	1
up	1
as	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
stall.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
wicked;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashes	1
under	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
your	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
this,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Remember	1
ye	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
my	1
servant,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
Horeb	1
for	1
all	1
Israel,	1
with	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments.	1
	1
4:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
you	1
Elijah	1
the	1
prophet	1
before	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
4:6	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
turn	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1

So	1
all	1
the	1

from	1

are	1
fourteen	1
generations;	1
and	1
from	1

from	1
the	1

into	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Christ	1
are	1
fourteen	1
generations.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
wise:	1
When	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
Mary	1
was	1
espoused	1
to	1
Joseph,	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
together,	1
she	1
was	1
found	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:19	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
her	1
husband,	1
being	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
publick	1
example,	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away	1
privily.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
while	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
these	1
things,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Joseph,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
fear	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
Mary	1
thy	1
wife:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
conceived	1
in	1
her	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:22	1
Now	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:23	1
Behold,	1
a	1
virgin	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Emmanuel,	1
which	1
being	1
interpreted	1
is,	1
God	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:24	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
sleep	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
bidden	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
wife:	1
1:25	1
And	1
knew	1
her	1
not	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod	1
the	1
king,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
wise	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
2:2	1
Saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
2:3	1
When	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
he	1
demanded	1
of	1
them	1
where	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
born.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
In	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
2:6	1
And	1
thou	1
Bethlehem,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Juda,	1
art	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Juda:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
come	1
a	1
Governor,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:7	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
privily	1
called	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
enquired	1
of	1
them	1
diligently	1
what	1
time	1
the	1
star	1
appeared.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
search	1
diligently	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
child;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
also.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
king,	1
they	1
departed;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
star,	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
where	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
was.	1
	1
2:10	1
When	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
star,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
exceeding	1
great	1
joy.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
their	1
treasures,	1
they	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
gifts;	1
gold,	1
and	1
frankincense	1
and	1
myrrh.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
Herod,	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
country	1
another	1
way.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
flee	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
there	1
until	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
word:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
to	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
2:14	1
When	1
he	1
arose,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
2:15	1
And	1
was	1
there	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Herod:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mocked	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
was	1
exceeding	1
wroth,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof,	1
from	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
under,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
diligently	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:18	1
In	1
Rama	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
heard,	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
weeping,	1
and	1
great	1
mourning,	1
Rachel	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
comforted,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
was	1
dead,	1
behold,	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
2:20	1
Saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
dead	1
which	1
sought	1
the	1
young	1
child's	1
life.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Archelaus	1
did	1
reign	1
in	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Herod,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
thither:	1
notwithstanding,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Galilee:	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nazareth:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
Nazarene.	1
	1
3:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
came	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist,	1
preaching	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
3:2	1
And	1
saying,	1
Repent	1
ye:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
John	1
had	1
his	1
raiment	1
of	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
a	1
leathern	1
girdle	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
his	1
meat	1
was	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey.	1
	1
3:5	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
3:6	1
And	1
were	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
Sadducees	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
baptism,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance:	1
3:9	1
And	1
think	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
therefore	1
every	1
tree	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:11	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water	1
unto	1
repentance.	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
I,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
bear:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:12	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
gather	1
his	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
garner;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
up	1
the	1
chaff	1
with	1
unquenchable	1
fire.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
John,	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
John	1
forbad	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
comest	1
thou	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Suffer	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
now:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
becometh	1
us	1
to	1
fulfil	1
all	1
righteousness.	1
Then	1
he	1
suffered	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
went	1
up	1
straightway	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
opened	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
descending	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
lighting	1
upon	1
him:	1
3:17	1
And	1
lo	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
was	1
Jesus	1
led	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
fasted	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
he	1
was	1
afterward	1
an	1
hungred.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
tempter	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
that	1
these	1
stones	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
Man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
setteth	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
4:6	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
concerning	1
thee:	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:7	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
again,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
Again,	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
exceeding	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them;	1
4:9	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
me.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
leaveth	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
angels	1
came	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
4:13	1
And	1
leaving	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Zabulon	1
and	1
Nephthalim:	1
4:14	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
4:15	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Zabulon,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephthalim,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
Galilee	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
4:16	1
The	1
people	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
darkness	1
saw	1
great	1
light;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
region	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
light	1
is	1
sprung	1
up.	1
	1
4:17	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
preach,	1
and	1
to	1
say,	1
Repent:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
walking	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
saw	1
two	1
brethren,	1
Simon	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Follow	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
they	1
straightway	1
left	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
going	1
on	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
two	1
brethren,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
Zebedee	1
their	1
father,	1
mending	1
their	1
nets;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
they	1
immediately	1
left	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
his	1
fame	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
Syria:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
sick	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
and	1
torments,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
palsy;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
great	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
from	1
Decapolis,	1
and	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
seeing	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
set,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him:	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
taught	1
them,	1
saying,	1
5:3	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
spirit:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:4	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
mourn:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
5:5	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
meek:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:6	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
after	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
5:7	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
merciful:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
pure	1
in	1
heart:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
God.	1
	1
5:9	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
peacemakers:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:10	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
persecuted	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:11	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
revile	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil	1
against	1
you	1
falsely,	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
	1
5:12	1
Rejoice,	1
and	1
be	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
so	1
persecuted	1
they	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
salt	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
salted?	1
it	1
is	1
thenceforth	1
good	1
for	1
nothing,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
A	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
an	1
hill	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
5:15	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick;	1
and	1
it	1
giveth	1
light	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:16	1
Let	1
your	1
light	1
so	1
shine	1
before	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
and	1
glorify	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:17	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
the	1
prophets:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy,	1
but	1
to	1
fulfil.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Till	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
pass,	1
one	1
jot	1
or	1
one	1
tittle	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
5:19	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
break	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
least	1
commandments,	1
and	1
shall	1
teach	1
men	1
so,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
and	1
teach	1
them,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
except	1
your	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
exceed	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:21	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
kill	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
5:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Raca,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
council:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
5:23	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
thy	1
gift	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
there	1
rememberest	1
that	1
thy	1
brother	1
hath	1
ought	1
against	1
thee;	1
5:24	1
Leave	1
there	1
thy	1
gift	1
before	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
first	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
and	1
offer	1
thy	1
gift.	1
	1
5:25	1
Agree	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
quickly,	1
whiles	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
him;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
the	1
adversary	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
5:26	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
come	1
out	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
uttermost	1
farthing.	1
	1
5:27	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
5:28	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
looketh	1
on	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
lust	1
after	1
her	1
hath	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
already	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:31	1
It	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement:	1
5:32	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
saving	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
fornication,	1
causeth	1
her	1
to	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
5:33	1
Again,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forswear	1
thyself,	1
but	1
shalt	1
perform	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
thine	1
oaths:	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Swear	1
not	1
at	1
all;	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
God's	1
throne:	1
5:35	1
Nor	1
by	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
footstool:	1
neither	1
by	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
King.	1
	1
5:36	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
swear	1
by	1
thy	1
head,	1
because	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
make	1
one	1
hair	1
white	1
or	1
black.	1
	1
5:37	1
But	1
let	1
your	1
communication	1
be,	1
Yea,	1
yea;	1
Nay,	1
nay:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
these	1
cometh	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:38	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
An	1
eye	1
for	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
a	1
tooth	1
for	1
a	1
tooth:	1
5:39	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
resist	1
not	1
evil:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
cheek,	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
also.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
sue	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
coat,	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1
cloak	1
also.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
compel	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
mile,	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
twain.	1
	1
5:42	1
Give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
asketh	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
borrow	1
of	1
thee	1
turn	1
not	1
thou	1
away.	1
	1
5:43	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
hate	1
thine	1
enemy.	1
	1
5:44	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you;	1
5:45	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
he	1
maketh	1
his	1
sun	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
unjust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
reward	1
have	1
ye?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
the	1
same?	1
	1
5:47	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
salute	1
your	1
brethren	1
only,	1
what	1
do	1
ye	1
more	1
than	1
others?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
so?	1
	1
5:48	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
perfect,	1
even	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
is	1
perfect.	1
	1
6:1	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
your	1
alms	1
before	1
men,	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
them:	1
otherwise	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:2	1
Therefore	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
thine	1
alms,	1
do	1
not	1
sound	1
a	1
trumpet	1
before	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
glory	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:3	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
alms,	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
left	1
hand	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
doeth:	1
6:4	1
That	1
thine	1
alms	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
himself	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
are:	1
for	1
they	1
love	1
to	1
pray	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
enter	1
into	1
thy	1
closet,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
shut	1
thy	1
door,	1
pray	1
to	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret;	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
use	1
not	1
vain	1
repetitions,	1
as	1
the	1
heathen	1
do:	1
for	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
for	1
their	1
much	1
speaking.	1
	1
6:8	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
like	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of,	1
before	1
ye	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
6:9	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
therefore	1
pray	1
ye:	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
6:10	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come,	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
earth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:11	1
Give	1
us	1
this	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
debts,	1
as	1
we	1
forgive	1
our	1
debtors.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation,	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil:	1
For	1
thine	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
the	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
will	1
also	1
forgive	1
you:	1
6:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
not	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
6:16	1
Moreover	1
when	1
ye	1
fast,	1
be	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites,	1
of	1
a	1
sad	1
countenance:	1
for	1
they	1
disfigure	1
their	1
faces,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
appear	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
fastest,	1
anoint	1
thine	1
head,	1
and	1
wash	1
thy	1
face;	1
6:18	1
That	1
thou	1
appear	1
not	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast,	1
but	1
unto	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father,	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret,	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:19	1
Lay	1
not	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
upon	1
earth,	1
where	1
moth	1
and	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
steal:	1
6:20	1
But	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
in	1
heaven,	1
where	1
neither	1
moth	1
nor	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
do	1
not	1
break	1
through	1
nor	1
steal:	1
6:21	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
if	1
therefore	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
6:23	1
But	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
evil,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
darkness,	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
that	1
darkness!	1
	1
6:24	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
6:25	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink;	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
life	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
than	1
raiment?	1
	1
6:26	1
Behold	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air:	1
for	1
they	1
sow	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap,	1
nor	1
gather	1
into	1
barns;	1
yet	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them.	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
	1
6:27	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
one	1
cubit	1
unto	1
his	1
stature?	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
raiment?	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
how	1
they	1
grow;	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
spin:	1
6:29	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
even	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
6:30	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
which	1
to	1
day	1
is,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
6:31	1
Therefore	1
take	1
no	1
thought,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat?	1
or,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink?	1
or,	1
Wherewithal	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
clothed?	1
	1
6:32	1
(For	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
seek:)	1
for	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
6:33	1
But	1
seek	1
ye	1
first	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:34	1
Take	1
therefore	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
morrow:	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
shall	1
take	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
itself.	1
Sufficient	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
evil	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:1	1
Judge	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
judged.	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
with	1
what	1
judgment	1
ye	1
judge,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
judged:	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
considerest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:4	1
Or	1
how	1
wilt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
eye;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
beam	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:5	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
first	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye;	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
7:6	1
Give	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs,	1
neither	1
cast	1
ye	1
your	1
pearls	1
before	1
swine,	1
lest	1
they	1
trample	1
them	1
under	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
and	1
rend	1
you.	1
	1
7:7	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you:	1
7:8	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:9	1
Or	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
you,	1
whom	1
if	1
his	1
son	1
ask	1
bread,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
	1
7:10	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
give	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
7:12	1
Therefore	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
even	1
so	1
to	1
them:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
7:13	1
Enter	1
ye	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
wide	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
broad	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
leadeth	1
to	1
destruction,	1
and	1
many	1
there	1
be	1
which	1
go	1
in	1
thereat:	1
7:14	1
Because	1
strait	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
narrow	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
which	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
life,	1
and	1
few	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
7:15	1
Beware	1
of	1
false	1
prophets,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
sheep's	1
clothing,	1
but	1
inwardly	1
they	1
are	1
ravening	1
wolves.	1
	1
7:16	1
Ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
fruits.	1
Do	1
men	1
gather	1
grapes	1
of	1
thorns,	1
or	1
figs	1
of	1
thistles?	1
	1
7:17	1
Even	1
so	1
every	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit;	1
but	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:18	1
A	1
good	1
tree	1
cannot	1
bring	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit,	1
neither	1
can	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:19	1
Every	1
tree	1
that	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
7:20	1
Wherefore	1
by	1
their	1
fruits	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
7:21	1
Not	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
7:22	1
Many	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
prophesied	1
in	1
thy	1
name?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
have	1
cast	1
out	1
devils?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
done	1
many	1
wonderful	1
works?	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
profess	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
you:	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:24	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1
him	1
unto	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
a	1
rock:	1
7:25	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
not:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them	1
not,	1
shall	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
foolish	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
sand:	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
ended	1
these	1
sayings,	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
7:29	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
having	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
8:1	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
leprosy	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man;	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum,	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
centurion,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
8:6	1
And	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
my	1
servant	1
lieth	1
at	1
home	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
grievously	1
tormented.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
him.	1
	1
8:8	1
The	1
centurion	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
come	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
only,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
soldiers	1
under	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
man,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
followed,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed,	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
his	1
servant	1
was	1
healed	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
hour.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Peter's	1
house,	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
wife's	1
mother	1
laid,	1
and	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:16	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils:	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
spirits	1
with	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
healed	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
sick:	1
8:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Himself	1
took	1
our	1
infirmities,	1
and	1
bare	1
our	1
sicknesses.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
great	1
multitudes	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
depart	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
scribe	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
another	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
8:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
his	1
disciples	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:24	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
waves:	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
us:	1
we	1
perish.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
fearful,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
8:27	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him!	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gergesenes,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
two	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs,	1
exceeding	1
fierce,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
pass	1
by	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
8:29	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
torment	1
us	1
before	1
the	1
time?	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off	1
from	1
them	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
8:31	1
So	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
cast	1
us	1
out,	1
suffer	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out,	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
kept	1
them	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
told	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
befallen	1
to	1
the	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
8:34	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
9:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
bed:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
seeing	1
their	1
faith	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy;	1
Son,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
9:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
said	1
within	1
themselves,	1
This	1
man	1
blasphemeth.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
think	1
ye	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
Arise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
unto	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
9:8	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
multitudes	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
such	1
power	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
forth	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man,	1
named	1
Matthew,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
behold,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
came	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Why	1
eateth	1
your	1
Master	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
9:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
be	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
go	1
ye	1
and	1
learn	1
what	1
that	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
9:14	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast	1
oft,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
mourn,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
but	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast.	1
	1
9:16	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
unto	1
an	1
old	1
garment,	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
in	1
to	1
fill	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
from	1
the	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
9:17	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
bottles	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
runneth	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
perish:	1
but	1
they	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
new	1
bottles,	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
9:18	1
While	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
My	1
daughter	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
dead:	1
but	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hand	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
diseased	1
with	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
9:21	1
For	1
she	1
said	1
within	1
herself,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
but	1
touch	1
his	1
garment,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
said,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
hour.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
ruler's	1
house,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
minstrels	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
making	1
a	1
noise,	1
9:24	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
place:	1
for	1
the	1
maid	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
	1
9:25	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
put	1
forth,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
arose.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
hereof	1
went	1
abroad	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
land.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
thence,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
followed	1
him,	1
crying,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
blind	1
men	1
came	1
to	1
him:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Believe	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
this?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:29	1
Then	1
touched	1
he	1
their	1
eyes,	1
saying,	1
According	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
See	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
spread	1
abroad	1
his	1
fame	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
country.	1
	1
9:32	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
dumb	1
man	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake:	1
and	1
the	1
multitudes	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
seen	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
sickness	1
and	1
every	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:36	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
fainted,	1
and	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
as	1
sheep	1
having	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
9:37	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
plenteous,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few;	1
9:38	1
Pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
against	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease.	1
	1
10:2	1
Now	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
are	1
these;	1
The	1
first,	1
Simon,	1
who	1
is	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother;	1
10:3	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew;	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
Matthew	1
the	1
publican;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Lebbaeus,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Thaddaeus;	1
10:4	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
who	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him.	1
	1
10:5	1
These	1
twelve	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
into	1
any	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
enter	1
ye	1
not:	1
10:6	1
But	1
go	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
go,	1
preach,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
10:8	1
Heal	1
the	1
sick,	1
cleanse	1
the	1
lepers,	1
raise	1
the	1
dead,	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
freely	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
freely	1
give.	1
	1
10:9	1
Provide	1
neither	1
gold,	1
nor	1
silver,	1
nor	1
brass	1
in	1
your	1
purses,	1
10:10	1
Nor	1
scrip	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
two	1
coats,	1
neither	1
shoes,	1
nor	1
yet	1
staves:	1
for	1
the	1
workman	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
meat.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
or	1
town	1
ye	1
shall	1
enter,	1
enquire	1
who	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
worthy;	1
and	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
go	1
thence.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
salute	1
it.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
house	1
be	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
come	1
upon	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
return	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
your	1
words,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
or	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
feet.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
sheep	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
wolves:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
wise	1
as	1
serpents,	1
and	1
harmless	1
as	1
doves.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
beware	1
of	1
men:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
councils,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
scourge	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues;	1
10:18	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
governors	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak.	1
	1
10:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
speaketh	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
child:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:23	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
persecute	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
flee	1
ye	1
into	1
another:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
come.	1
	1
10:24	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master,	1
nor	1
the	1
servant	1
above	1
his	1
lord.	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
disciple	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
as	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
called	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Beelzebub,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
household?	1
	1
10:26	1
Fear	1
them	1
not	1
therefore:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
and	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
10:27	1
What	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye	1
in	1
light:	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
the	1
ear,	1
that	1
preach	1
ye	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
fear	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
but	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
soul:	1
but	1
rather	1
fear	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
in	1
hell.	1
	1
10:29	1
Are	1
not	1
two	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
farthing?	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
your	1
Father.	1
	1
10:30	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
	1
10:31	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore,	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
10:32	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
confess	1
also	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
deny	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
deny	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:34	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
peace	1
on	1
earth:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
peace,	1
but	1
a	1
sword.	1
	1
10:35	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
variance	1
against	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
foes	1
shall	1
be	1
they	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
household.	1
	1
10:37	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
father	1
or	1
mother	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
son	1
or	1
daughter	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:38	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
not	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:39	1
He	1
that	1
findeth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loseth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
10:40	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
you	1
receiveth	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
prophet	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
prophet	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
prophet's	1
reward;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
righteous	1
man's	1
reward.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
to	1
drink	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
disciple,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
commanding	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
preach	1
in	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
when	1
John	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come,	1
or	1
do	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
11:4	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
and	1
shew	1
John	1
again	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
hear	1
and	1
see:	1
11:5	1
The	1
blind	1
receive	1
their	1
sight,	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
have	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed,	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
multitudes	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
behold,	1
they	1
that	1
wear	1
soft	1
clothing	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
houses.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
11:11	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
risen	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
notwithstanding	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
until	1
now	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
suffereth	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
violent	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
prophesied	1
until	1
John.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
receive	1
it,	1
this	1
is	1
Elias,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:15	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
this	1
generation?	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
their	1
fellows,	1
11:17	1
And	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
lamented.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
nor	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
11:19	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
man	1
gluttonous,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners.	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
upbraid	1
the	1
cities	1
wherein	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
works	1
were	1
done,	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
not:	1
11:21	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
repented	1
long	1
ago	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
hell:	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
thee,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Sodom,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:24	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:25	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes.	1
	1
11:26	1
Even	1
so,	1
Father:	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
11:27	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
any	1
man	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
11:28	1
Come	1
unto	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
labour	1
and	1
are	1
heavy	1
laden,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
rest.	1
	1
11:29	1
Take	1
my	1
yoke	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
learn	1
of	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
unto	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
my	1
yoke	1
is	1
easy,	1
and	1
my	1
burden	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
12:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
through	1
the	1
corn;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
12:2	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
disciples	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
12:4	1
How	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
eat,	1
neither	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
priests?	1
	1
12:5	1
Or	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
how	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
profane	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
are	1
blameless?	1
12:6	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
one	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
this	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice,	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
condemned	1
the	1
guiltless.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
thence,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
their	1
synagogue:	1
12:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
withered.	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
man	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
sheep,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
pit	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
lift	1
it	1
out?	1
	1
12:12	1
How	1
much	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
sheep?	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
forth;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
restored	1
whole,	1
like	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
12:14	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
held	1
a	1
council	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
12:15	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
from	1
thence:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
all;	1
12:16	1
And	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known:	1
12:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
12:18	1
Behold	1
my	1
servant,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen;	1
my	1
beloved,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
well	1
pleased:	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
12:19	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
strive,	1
nor	1
cry;	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
12:20	1
A	1
bruised	1
reed	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
smoking	1
flax	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
quench,	1
till	1
he	1
send	1
forth	1
judgment	1
unto	1
victory.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
12:22	1
Then	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil,	1
blind,	1
and	1
dumb:	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
him,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
dumb	1
both	1
spake	1
and	1
saw.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
doth	1
not	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
but	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
every	1
city	1
or	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
12:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan,	1
he	1
is	1
divided	1
against	1
himself;	1
how	1
shall	1
then	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
children	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
12:28	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
then	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:29	1
Or	1
else	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man?	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
12:30	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth	1
abroad.	1
	1
12:31	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
manner	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
blasphemy	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men:	1
but	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him,	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
12:33	1
Either	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
good,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
good;	1
or	1
else	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
corrupt:	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:34	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye,	1
being	1
evil,	1
speak	1
good	1
things?	1
	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
12:35	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
things:	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
things.	1
	1
12:36	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
every	1
idle	1
word	1
that	1
men	1
shall	1
speak,	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
12:37	1
For	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
justified,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
condemned.	1
	1
12:38	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
12:39	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
evil	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas:	1
12:40	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
belly;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:41	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
rise	1
in	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:42	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:43	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest,	1
and	1
findeth	1
none.	1
	1
12:44	1
Then	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
from	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
empty,	1
swept,	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
12:45	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
with	1
himself	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself,	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
Even	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
unto	1
this	1
wicked	1
generation.	1
	1
12:46	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
behold,	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
stood	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:47	1
Then	1
one	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother?	1
	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
my	1
brethren?	1
	1
12:49	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
12:50	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
13:1	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
went	1
Jesus	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
a	1
sower	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
sow;	1
13:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
seeds	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
them	1
up:	1
13:5	1
Some	1
fell	1
upon	1
stony	1
places,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
they	1
sprung	1
up,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
deepness	1
of	1
earth:	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
they	1
were	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
they	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
them:	1
13:8	1
But	1
other	1
fell	1
into	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixtyfold,	1
some	1
thirtyfold.	1
	1
13:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
speakest	1
thou	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables?	1
	1
13:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
given.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
abundance:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
speak	1
I	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
parables:	1
because	1
they	1
seeing	1
see	1
not;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
hear	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
understand.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
Esaias,	1
which	1
saith,	1
By	1
hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
perceive:	1
13:15	1
For	1
this	1
people's	1
heart	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
they	1
have	1
closed;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
should	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
blessed	1
are	1
your	1
eyes,	1
for	1
they	1
see:	1
and	1
your	1
ears,	1
for	1
they	1
hear.	1
	1
13:17	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
righteous	1
men	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
Hear	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
sower.	1
	1
13:19	1
When	1
any	1
one	1
heareth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it	1
not,	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
catcheth	1
away	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
received	1
seed	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side.	1
	1
13:20	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
the	1
seed	1
into	1
stony	1
places,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
anon	1
with	1
joy	1
receiveth	1
it;	1
13:21	1
Yet	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
root	1
in	1
himself,	1
but	1
dureth	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
when	1
tribulation	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
he	1
is	1
offended.	1
	1
13:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
among	1
the	1
thorns	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
he	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it;	1
which	1
also	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
some	1
thirty.	1
	1
13:24	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
sowed	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:25	1
But	1
while	1
men	1
slept,	1
his	1
enemy	1
came	1
and	1
sowed	1
tares	1
among	1
the	1
wheat,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
13:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
blade	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
then	1
appeared	1
the	1
tares	1
also.	1
	1
13:27	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
householder	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
sow	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
thy	1
field?	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hath	1
it	1
tares?	1
	1
13:28	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
enemy	1
hath	1
done	1
this.	1
The	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
up?	1
	1
13:29	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
lest	1
while	1
ye	1
gather	1
up	1
the	1
tares,	1
ye	1
root	1
up	1
also	1
the	1
wheat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
13:30	1
Let	1
both	1
grow	1
together	1
until	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
reapers,	1
Gather	1
ye	1
together	1
first	1
the	1
tares,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
in	1
bundles	1
to	1
burn	1
them:	1
but	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
my	1
barn.	1
	1
13:31	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
sowed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:32	1
Which	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
seeds:	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
grown,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
among	1
herbs,	1
and	1
becometh	1
a	1
tree,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
come	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:33	1
Another	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
unto	1
them;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took,	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:34	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
in	1
parables;	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
13:35	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
parables;	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:36	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
tares	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
13:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
soweth	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man;	1
13:38	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
the	1
world;	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
one;	1
13:39	1
The	1
enemy	1
that	1
sowed	1
them	1
is	1
the	1
devil;	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
the	1
reapers	1
are	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
13:40	1
As	1
therefore	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
gathered	1
and	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
13:41	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
offend,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
iniquity;	1
13:42	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:43	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
shine	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
their	1
Father.	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:44	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
treasure	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
field;	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
found,	1
he	1
hideth,	1
and	1
for	1
joy	1
thereof	1
goeth	1
and	1
selleth	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
and	1
buyeth	1
that	1
field.	1
	1
13:45	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
merchant	1
man,	1
seeking	1
goodly	1
pearls:	1
13:46	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
one	1
pearl	1
of	1
great	1
price,	1
went	1
and	1
sold	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
bought	1
it.	1
	1
13:47	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
net,	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
gathered	1
of	1
every	1
kind:	1
13:48	1
Which,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
full,	1
they	1
drew	1
to	1
shore,	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
good	1
into	1
vessels,	1
but	1
cast	1
the	1
bad	1
away.	1
	1
13:49	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
the	1
angels	1
shall	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
sever	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
just,	1
13:50	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:51	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
understood	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:52	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Therefore	1
every	1
scribe	1
which	1
is	1
instructed	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasure	1
things	1
new	1
and	1
old.	1
	1
13:53	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
parables,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
13:54	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
astonished,	1
and	1
said,	1
Whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
this	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
these	1
mighty	1
works?	1
	1
13:55	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
son?	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
mother	1
called	1
Mary?	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Simon,	1
and	1
Judas?	1
	1
13:56	1
And	1
his	1
sisters,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
with	1
us?	1
Whence	1
then	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
13:57	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
in	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
save	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
13:58	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
many	1
mighty	1
works	1
there	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
	1
14:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
14:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
This	1
is	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Herod	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife.	1
	1
14:4	1
For	1
John	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
counted	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
14:6	1
But	1
when	1
Herod's	1
birthday	1
was	1
kept,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Herodias	1
danced	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod.	1
	1
14:7	1
Whereupon	1
he	1
promised	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
would	1
ask.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
she,	1
being	1
before	1
instructed	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
said,	1
Give	1
me	1
here	1
John	1
Baptist's	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
sorry:	1
nevertheless	1
for	1
the	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
meat,	1
he	1
commanded	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
he	1
sent,	1
and	1
beheaded	1
John	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
buried	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
by	1
ship	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
apart:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
they	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
their	1
sick.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
evening,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
now	1
past;	1
send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
victuals.	1
	1
14:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
need	1
not	1
depart;	1
give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
here	1
but	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
14:18	1
He	1
said,	1
Bring	1
them	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
loaves	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
apart	1
to	1
pray:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
alone.	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
tossed	1
with	1
waves:	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
for	1
fear.	1
	1
14:27	1
But	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
thou,	1
bid	1
me	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come.	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:30	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wind	1
boisterous,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid;	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
sink,	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
immediately	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
doubt?	1
14:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased.	1
	1
14:33	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
came	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:34	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased;	1
14:36	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
were	1
made	1
perfectly	1
whole.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Why	1
do	1
thy	1
disciples	1
transgress	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders?	1
for	1
they	1
wash	1
not	1
their	1
hands	1
when	1
they	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
15:3	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
your	1
tradition?	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
God	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother:	1
and,	1
He	1
that	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
15:6	1
And	1
honour	1
not	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
Thus	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
by	1
your	1
tradition.	1
	1
15:7	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
well	1
did	1
Esaias	1
prophesy	1
of	1
you,	1
saying,	1
15:8	1
This	1
people	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips;	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
in	1
vain	1
they	1
do	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
and	1
understand:	1
15:11	1
Not	1
that	1
which	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
defileth	1
a	1
man;	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth,	1
this	1
defileth	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
offended,	1
after	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Every	1
plant,	1
which	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
planted,	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
15:14	1
Let	1
them	1
alone:	1
they	1
be	1
blind	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
blind.	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind,	1
both	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch.	1
	1
15:15	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
this	1
parable.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
yet	1
without	1
understanding?	1
	1
15:17	1
Do	1
not	1
ye	1
yet	1
understand,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
entereth	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
is	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught?	1
	1
15:18	1
But	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
15:19	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
murders,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
thefts,	1
false	1
witness,	1
blasphemies:	1
15:20	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
defile	1
a	1
man:	1
but	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands	1
defileth	1
not	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
thence,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon.	1
	1
15:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Canaan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
coasts,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
grievously	1
vexed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
her	1
away;	1
for	1
she	1
crieth	1
after	1
us.	1
	1
15:24	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sent	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:25	1
Then	1
came	1
she	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
to	1
dogs.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Truth,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fall	1
from	1
their	1
masters'	1
table.	1
	1
15:28	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
O	1
woman,	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
faith:	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
And	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
there.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
having	1
with	1
them	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
blind,	1
dumb,	1
maimed,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them:	1
15:31	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
multitude	1
wondered,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
maimed	1
to	1
be	1
whole,	1
the	1
lame	1
to	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
to	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
continue	1
with	1
me	1
now	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting,	1
lest	1
they	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
should	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
to	1
fill	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
multitude?	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
little	1
fishes.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
fishes,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
them,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
were	1
four	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
took	1
ship,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Magdala.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
came,	1
and	1
tempting	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
them	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:2	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
evening,	1
ye	1
say,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
fair	1
weather:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
foul	1
weather	1
to	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red	1
and	1
lowering.	1
O	1
ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky;	1
but	1
can	1
ye	1
not	1
discern	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
times?	1
	1
16:4	1
A	1
wicked	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas.	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread.	1
	1
16:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
taken	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
16:8	1
Which	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
why	1
reason	1
ye	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
no	1
bread?	1
	1
16:9	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
yet	1
understand,	1
neither	1
remember	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:10	1
Neither	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:11	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
you	1
concerning	1
bread,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees?	1
	1
16:12	1
Then	1
understood	1
they	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
not	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
bread,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi,	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
am?	1
16:14	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Some	1
say	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
some,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
Jeremias,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
16:15	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou,	1
Simon	1
Barjona:	1
for	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
hath	1
not	1
revealed	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
thou	1
art	1
Peter,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
rock	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
my	1
church;	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
hell	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:20	1
Then	1
charged	1
he	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:21	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
began	1
Jesus	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
suffer	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
16:22	1
Then	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
Lord:	1
this	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
16:23	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
offence	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
16:24	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
16:25	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
16:26	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
profited,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
his	1
angels;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
reward	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
16:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
Peter,	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart,	1
17:2	1
And	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
did	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
17:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias	1
talking	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
here	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
17:5	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold,	1
a	1
bright	1
cloud	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased;	1
hear	1
ye	1
him.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
face,	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
Jesus	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
the	1
vision	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
until	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
then	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Elias	1
truly	1
shall	1
first	1
come,	1
and	1
restore	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
17:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
come	1
already,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed.	1
Likewise	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
suffer	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
17:13	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
17:15	1
Lord,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
sore	1
vexed:	1
for	1
ofttimes	1
he	1
falleth	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
oft	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cure	1
him.	1
	1
17:17	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
devil;	1
and	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
cured	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
17:19	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
Jesus	1
apart,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
of	1
your	1
unbelief:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Remove	1
hence	1
to	1
yonder	1
place;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remove;	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:21	1
Howbeit	1
this	1
kind	1
goeth	1
not	1
out	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men:	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
again.	1
	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorry.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
they	1
that	1
received	1
tribute	1
money	1
came	1
to	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said,	1
Doth	1
not	1
your	1
master	1
pay	1
tribute?	1
17:25	1
He	1
saith,	1
Yes.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
Jesus	1
prevented	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
Simon?	1
of	1
whom	1
do	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
take	1
custom	1
or	1
tribute?	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
children,	1
or	1
of	1
strangers?	1
	1
17:26	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Of	1
strangers.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Then	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
free.	1
	1
17:27	1
Notwithstanding,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
offend	1
them,	1
go	1
thou	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
cast	1
an	1
hook,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
first	1
cometh	1
up;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
money:	1
that	1
take,	1
and	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
18:1	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven?	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
called	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
18:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
become	1
as	1
little	1
children,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:4	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
as	1
this	1
little	1
child,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
such	1
little	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
But	1
whoso	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
which	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
18:7	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
of	1
offences!	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
offences	1
come;	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
offence	1
cometh!	1
	1
18:8	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
or	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
halt	1
or	1
maimed,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
or	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
18:10	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
despise	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones;	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
heaven	1
their	1
angels	1
do	1
always	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:11	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
18:12	1
How	1
think	1
ye?	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
gone	1
astray,	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
seeketh	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
astray?	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
find	1
it,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
rejoiceth	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
sheep,	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
which	1
went	1
not	1
astray.	1
	1
18:14	1
Even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
should	1
perish.	1
	1
18:15	1
Moreover	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
his	1
fault	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
alone:	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
thee,	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
thee,	1
then	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
more,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
every	1
word	1
may	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
them,	1
tell	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
church,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
as	1
an	1
heathen	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:18	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:19	1
Again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
if	1
two	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
agree	1
on	1
earth	1
as	1
touching	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
ask,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:20	1
For	1
where	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
there	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
18:21	1
Then	1
came	1
Peter	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
oft	1
shall	1
my	1
brother	1
sin	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
forgive	1
him?	1
till	1
seven	1
times?	1
	1
18:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Until	1
seven	1
times:	1
but,	1
Until	1
seventy	1
times	1
seven.	1
	1
18:23	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reckon,	1
one	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
talents.	1
	1
18:25	1
But	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
pay,	1
his	1
lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
payment	1
to	1
be	1
made.	1
	1
18:26	1
The	1
servant	1
therefore	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:27	1
Then	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
and	1
loosed	1
him,	1
and	1
forgave	1
him	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:28	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
servant	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
pence:	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
throat,	1
saying,	1
Pay	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
owest.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
his	1
fellowservant	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not:	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:31	1
So	1
when	1
his	1
fellowservants	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
sorry,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
unto	1
their	1
lord	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
18:32	1
Then	1
his	1
lord,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant,	1
I	1
forgave	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
debt,	1
because	1
thou	1
desiredst	1
me:	1
18:33	1
Shouldest	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
have	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
thee?	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
his	1
lord	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
tormentors,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
due	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
18:35	1
So	1
likewise	1
shall	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
do	1
also	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
from	1
your	1
hearts	1
forgive	1
not	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
brother	1
their	1
trespasses.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
19:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
19:3	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
every	1
cause?	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female,	1
19:5	1
And	1
said,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh?	1
	1
19:6	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
19:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
did	1
Moses	1
then	1
command	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away?	1
	1
19:8	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
suffered	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
your	1
wives:	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
fornication,	1
and	1
shall	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whoso	1
marrieth	1
her	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
doth	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
19:10	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
marry.	1
	1
19:11	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
men	1
cannot	1
receive	1
this	1
saying,	1
save	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
given.	1
	1
19:12	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
born	1
from	1
their	1
mother's	1
womb:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
eunuchs	1
of	1
men:	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
have	1
made	1
themselves	1
eunuchs	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven's	1
sake.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
little	1
children,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
pray:	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not,	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
19:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
good	1
thing	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
enter	1
into	1
life,	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments.	1
	1
19:18	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Which?	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
no	1
murder,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
19:19	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother:	1
and,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
19:20	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up:	1
what	1
lack	1
I	1
yet?	1
	1
19:21	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
perfect,	1
go	1
and	1
sell	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
19:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
shall	1
hardly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:25	1
When	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
amazed,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
19:26	1
But	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
men	1
this	1
is	1
impossible;	1
but	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
19:27	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee;	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
therefore?	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
which	1
have	1
followed	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
regeneration	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
twelve	1
thrones,	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
houses,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
and	1
shall	1
inherit	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
19:30	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first.	1
	1
20:1	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
hire	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
labourers	1
for	1
a	1
penny	1
a	1
day,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
saw	1
others	1
standing	1
idle	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
20:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them;	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
20:5	1
Again	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
and	1
ninth	1
hour,	1
and	1
did	1
likewise.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
others	1
standing	1
idle,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
stand	1
ye	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
idle?	1
	1
20:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
hired	1
us.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive.	1
	1
20:8	1
So	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
steward,	1
Call	1
the	1
labourers,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
hire,	1
beginning	1
from	1
the	1
last	1
unto	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
that	1
were	1
hired	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour,	1
they	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:10	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
came,	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
more;	1
and	1
they	1
likewise	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
it,	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
20:12	1
Saying,	1
These	1
last	1
have	1
wrought	1
but	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
them	1
equal	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
burden	1
and	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
20:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Friend,	1
I	1
do	1
thee	1
no	1
wrong:	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
penny?	1
	1
20:14	1
Take	1
that	1
thine	1
is,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
this	1
last,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
20:15	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
mine	1
own?	1
Is	1
thine	1
eye	1
evil,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
good?	1
	1
20:16	1
So	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
last:	1
for	1
many	1
be	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
chosen.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
took	1
the	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
apart	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
20:18	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
20:19	1
And	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
mock,	1
and	1
to	1
scourge,	1
and	1
to	1
crucify	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
20:20	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children	1
with	1
her	1
sons,	1
worshipping	1
him,	1
and	1
desiring	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
that	1
these	1
my	1
two	1
sons	1
may	1
sit,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
20:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask.	1
Are	1
ye	1
able	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
drink	1
of,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
able.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
drink	1
indeed	1
of	1
my	1
cup,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with:	1
but	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left,	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
with	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
two	1
brethren.	1
	1
20:25	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
dominion	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
great	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:26	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
minister;	1
20:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
chief	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
servant:	1
20:28	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
20:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace:	1
but	1
they	1
cried	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
you?	1
	1
20:33	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
20:34	1
So	1
Jesus	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
touched	1
their	1
eyes:	1
and	1
immediately	1
their	1
eyes	1
received	1
sight,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bethphage,	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
then	1
sent	1
Jesus	1
two	1
disciples,	1
21:2	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
straightway	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
an	1
ass	1
tied,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
with	1
her:	1
loose	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
ought	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
them.	1
	1
21:4	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
21:5	1
Tell	1
ye	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
meek,	1
and	1
sitting	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
went,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
commanded	1
them,	1
21:7	1
And	1
brought	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
them	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
thereon.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
multitude	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
multitudes	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this?	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
Jesus	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
21:13	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
saw	1
the	1
wonderful	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
displeased,	1
21:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
what	1
these	1
say?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yea;	1
have	1
ye	1
never	1
read,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
babes	1
and	1
sucklings	1
thou	1
hast	1
perfected	1
praise?	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
into	1
Bethany;	1
and	1
he	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
21:18	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
he	1
hungered.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
nothing	1
thereon,	1
but	1
leaves	1
only,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
Let	1
no	1
fruit	1
grow	1
on	1
thee	1
henceforward	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
presently	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
soon	1
is	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away!	1
	1
21:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith,	1
and	1
doubt	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
but	1
also	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
all	1
things,	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
prayer,	1
believing,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
and	1
said,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing,	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
in	1
like	1
wise	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:25	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
whence	1
was	1
it?	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
us,	1
Why	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
21:26	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
we	1
fear	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
all	1
hold	1
John	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:28	1
But	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
said,	1
Son,	1
go	1
work	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
21:29	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
repented,	1
and	1
went.	1
	1
21:30	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
said	1
likewise.	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
go,	1
sir:	1
and	1
went	1
not.	1
	1
21:31	1
Whether	1
of	1
them	1
twain	1
did	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
father?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
first.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
21:32	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
believed	1
him:	1
and	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
repented	1
not	1
afterward,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
21:33	1
Hear	1
another	1
parable:	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
householder,	1
which	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
hedged	1
it	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
winepress	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
21:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
drew	1
near,	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
beat	1
one,	1
and	1
killed	1
another,	1
and	1
stoned	1
another.	1
	1
21:36	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
other	1
servants	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:37	1
But	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
son,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:38	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
the	1
son,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
seize	1
on	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
21:39	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
21:40	1
When	1
the	1
lord	1
therefore	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
cometh,	1
what	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
unto	1
those	1
husbandmen?	1
	1
21:41	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
will	1
miserably	1
destroy	1
those	1
wicked	1
men,	1
and	1
will	1
let	1
out	1
his	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
other	1
husbandmen,	1
which	1
shall	1
render	1
him	1
the	1
fruits	1
in	1
their	1
seasons.	1
	1
21:42	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Did	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
21:43	1
Therefore	1
say	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
nation	1
bringing	1
forth	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
on	1
this	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
21:45	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
parables,	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:46	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
again	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said,	1
22:2	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
22:3	1
And	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden	1
to	1
the	1
wedding:	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
22:4	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
other	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
bidden,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
my	1
dinner:	1
my	1
oxen	1
and	1
my	1
fatlings	1
are	1
killed,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
ready:	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
they	1
made	1
light	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways,	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
farm,	1
another	1
to	1
his	1
merchandise:	1
22:6	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
entreated	1
them	1
spitefully,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
22:7	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
was	1
wroth:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
armies,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
those	1
murderers,	1
and	1
burned	1
up	1
their	1
city.	1
	1
22:8	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
The	1
wedding	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
were	1
not	1
worthy.	1
	1
22:9	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
find,	1
bid	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:10	1
So	1
those	1
servants	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
they	1
found,	1
both	1
bad	1
and	1
good:	1
and	1
the	1
wedding	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
guests.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
guests,	1
he	1
saw	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
on	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment:	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
how	1
camest	1
thou	1
in	1
hither	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment?	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
speechless.	1
	1
22:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
the	1
servants,	1
Bind	1
him	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
22:14	1
For	1
many	1
are	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
are	1
chosen.	1
	1
22:15	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
entangle	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
talk.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
their	1
disciples	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth,	1
neither	1
carest	1
thou	1
for	1
any	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
22:17	1
Tell	1
us	1
therefore,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou?	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
22:18	1
But	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me,	1
ye	1
hypocrites?	1
	1
22:19	1
Shew	1
me	1
the	1
tribute	1
money.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
22:21	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Caesar's;	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
22:22	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
22:23	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
22:24	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
said,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
die,	1
having	1
no	1
children,	1
his	1
brother	1
shall	1
marry	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
22:25	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
deceased,	1
and,	1
having	1
no	1
issue,	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
his	1
brother:	1
22:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
second	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
unto	1
the	1
seventh.	1
	1
22:27	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
22:28	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
seven?	1
	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
her.	1
	1
22:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
do	1
err,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
nor	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:30	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
22:31	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
God,	1
saying,	1
22:32	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
multitude	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
22:34	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
to	1
silence,	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
22:35	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
question,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
22:36	1
Master,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
commandment	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
22:37	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind.	1
	1
22:38	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
great	1
commandment.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
it,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:40	1
On	1
these	1
two	1
commandments	1
hang	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
22:41	1
While	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
them,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
What	1
think	1
ye	1
of	1
Christ?	1
whose	1
son	1
is	1
he?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
22:43	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
then	1
doth	1
David	1
in	1
spirit	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
saying,	1
22:44	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
22:45	1
If	1
David	1
then	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
22:46	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
a	1
word,	1
neither	1
durst	1
any	1
man	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
more	1
questions.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
23:2	1
Saying	1
The	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
sit	1
in	1
Moses'	1
seat:	1
23:3	1
All	1
therefore	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
bid	1
you	1
observe,	1
that	1
observe	1
and	1
do;	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
after	1
their	1
works:	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
and	1
do	1
not.	1
	1
23:4	1
For	1
they	1
bind	1
heavy	1
burdens	1
and	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
men's	1
shoulders;	1
but	1
they	1
themselves	1
will	1
not	1
move	1
them	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
fingers.	1
	1
23:5	1
But	1
all	1
their	1
works	1
they	1
do	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men:	1
they	1
make	1
broad	1
their	1
phylacteries,	1
and	1
enlarge	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
garments,	1
23:6	1
And	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
23:7	1
And	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
men,	1
Rabbi,	1
Rabbi.	1
	1
23:8	1
But	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
called	1
Rabbi:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ;	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
call	1
no	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Father,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
23:10	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
called	1
masters:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ.	1
	1
23:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
servant.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
23:13	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
against	1
men:	1
for	1
ye	1
neither	1
go	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
neither	1
suffer	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
entering	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
23:14	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayer:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
23:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
compass	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
proselyte,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
made,	1
ye	1
make	1
him	1
twofold	1
more	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
hell	1
than	1
yourselves.	1
	1
23:16	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor!	1
	1
23:17	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gold,	1
or	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gold?	1
	1
23:18	1
And,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty.	1
	1
23:19	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gift,	1
or	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gift?	1
	1
23:20	1
Whoso	1
therefore	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
things	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
heaven,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:23	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
pay	1
tithe	1
of	1
mint	1
and	1
anise	1
and	1
cummin,	1
and	1
have	1
omitted	1
the	1
weightier	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
judgment,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
faith:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
23:24	1
Ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
strain	1
at	1
a	1
gnat,	1
and	1
swallow	1
a	1
camel.	1
	1
23:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
platter,	1
but	1
within	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
extortion	1
and	1
excess.	1
	1
23:26	1
Thou	1
blind	1
Pharisee,	1
cleanse	1
first	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
platter,	1
that	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
clean	1
also.	1
	1
23:27	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
whited	1
sepulchres,	1
which	1
indeed	1
appear	1
beautiful	1
outward,	1
but	1
are	1
within	1
full	1
of	1
dead	1
men's	1
bones,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
23:28	1
Even	1
so	1
ye	1
also	1
outwardly	1
appear	1
righteous	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
within	1
ye	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
iniquity.	1
	1
23:29	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
because	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
tombs	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
garnish	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
righteous,	1
23:30	1
And	1
say,	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
partakers	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:31	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
killed	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:32	1
Fill	1
ye	1
up	1
then	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
23:33	1
Ye	1
serpents,	1
ye	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
escape	1
the	1
damnation	1
of	1
hell?	1
	1
23:34	1
Wherefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
prophets,	1
and	1
wise	1
men,	1
and	1
scribes:	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
kill	1
and	1
crucify;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
scourge	1
in	1
your	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
persecute	1
them	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city:	1
23:35	1
That	1
upon	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
all	1
the	1
righteous	1
blood	1
shed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
righteous	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
son	1
of	1
Barachias,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
between	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
23:36	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
23:37	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
thou	1
that	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
gathereth	1
her	1
chickens	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
23:38	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate.	1
	1
23:39	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
henceforth,	1
till	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
him	1
the	1
buildings	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
See	1
ye	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
here	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
privately,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
thy	1
coming,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars:	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
24:7	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences,	1
and	1
earthquakes,	1
in	1
divers	1
places.	1
	1
24:8	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
offended,	1
and	1
shall	1
betray	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
shall	1
hate	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
because	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
abound,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
many	1
shall	1
wax	1
cold.	1
	1
24:13	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
this	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
nations;	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
come.	1
	1
24:15	1
When	1
ye	1
therefore	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
(whoso	1
readeth,	1
let	1
him	1
understand:)	1
24:16	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
mountains:	1
24:17	1
Let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
24:18	1
Neither	1
let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
return	1
back	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
24:20	1
But	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
neither	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
24:21	1
For	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
this	1
time,	1
no,	1
nor	1
ever	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
except	1
those	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
shortened,	1
there	1
should	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
shortened.	1
	1
24:23	1
Then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ,	1
or	1
there;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:24	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
false	1
Christs,	1
and	1
false	1
prophets,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
great	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders;	1
insomuch	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
they	1
shall	1
deceive	1
the	1
very	1
elect.	1
	1
24:25	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before.	1
	1
24:26	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
go	1
not	1
forth:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
chambers;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:27	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
shineth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
west;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:28	1
For	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
carcase	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
24:29	1
Immediately	1
after	1
the	1
tribulation	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken:	1
24:30	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
appear	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
mourn,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
his	1
angels	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
24:32	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
his	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
nigh:	1
24:33	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
24:34	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
24:35	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away,	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
24:36	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
only.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe	1
were,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:38	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
the	1
flood	1
they	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
marrying	1
and	1
giving	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
24:39	1
And	1
knew	1
not	1
until	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
away;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:40	1
Then	1
shall	1
two	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:41	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
at	1
the	1
mill;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:42	1
Watch	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
hour	1
your	1
Lord	1
doth	1
come.	1
	1
24:43	1
But	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
what	1
watch	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
up.	1
	1
24:44	1
Therefore	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
ready:	1
for	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
hour	1
as	1
ye	1
think	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
24:45	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
hath	1
made	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
24:46	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
24:47	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
24:48	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
evil	1
servant	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
24:49	1
And	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
smite	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
the	1
drunken;	1
24:50	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware	1
of,	1
24:51	1
And	1
shall	1
cut	1
him	1
asunder,	1
and	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
hypocrites:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
ten	1
virgins,	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
five	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
wise,	1
and	1
five	1
were	1
foolish.	1
	1
25:3	1
They	1
that	1
were	1
foolish	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
took	1
no	1
oil	1
with	1
them:	1
25:4	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
took	1
oil	1
in	1
their	1
vessels	1
with	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:5	1
While	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
tarried,	1
they	1
all	1
slumbered	1
and	1
slept.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cry	1
made,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
cometh;	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
25:7	1
Then	1
all	1
those	1
virgins	1
arose,	1
and	1
trimmed	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
the	1
foolish	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
Give	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
oil;	1
for	1
our	1
lamps	1
are	1
gone	1
out.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
so;	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
and	1
you:	1
but	1
go	1
ye	1
rather	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sell,	1
and	1
buy	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
buy,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
came;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
ready	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
marriage:	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut.	1
	1
25:11	1
Afterward	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
virgins,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
25:12	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
25:13	1
Watch	1
therefore,	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
neither	1
the	1
day	1
nor	1
the	1
hour	1
wherein	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
25:14	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
travelling	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
who	1
called	1
his	1
own	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
25:15	1
And	1
unto	1
one	1
he	1
gave	1
five	1
talents,	1
to	1
another	1
two,	1
and	1
to	1
another	1
one;	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
several	1
ability;	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
his	1
journey.	1
	1
25:16	1
Then	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
five	1
talents	1
went	1
and	1
traded	1
with	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
other	1
five	1
talents.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
likewise	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two,	1
he	1
also	1
gained	1
other	1
two.	1
	1
25:18	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
one	1
went	1
and	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
lord's	1
money.	1
	1
25:19	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
those	1
servants	1
cometh,	1
and	1
reckoneth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
five	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
other	1
five	1
talents,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
five	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
beside	1
them	1
five	1
talents	1
more.	1
	1
25:21	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
thou	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant:	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
two	1
other	1
talents	1
beside	1
them.	1
	1
25:23	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant;	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:24	1
Then	1
he	1
which	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
one	1
talent	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
knew	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
hard	1
man,	1
reaping	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sown,	1
and	1
gathering	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:25	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hid	1
thy	1
talent	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
lo,	1
there	1
thou	1
hast	1
that	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
25:26	1
His	1
lord	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wicked	1
and	1
slothful	1
servant,	1
thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
reap	1
where	1
I	1
sowed	1
not,	1
and	1
gather	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:27	1
Thou	1
oughtest	1
therefore	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
exchangers,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury.	1
	1
25:28	1
Take	1
therefore	1
the	1
talent	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
hath	1
ten	1
talents.	1
	1
25:29	1
For	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
abundance:	1
but	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
cast	1
ye	1
the	1
unprofitable	1
servant	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:31	1
When	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
angels	1
with	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory:	1
25:32	1
And	1
before	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
separate	1
them	1
one	1
from	1
another,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
divideth	1
his	1
sheep	1
from	1
the	1
goats:	1
25:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
sheep	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
but	1
the	1
goats	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
25:34	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
King	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
Come,	1
ye	1
blessed	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
prepared	1
for	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
25:35	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
drink:	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
in:	1
25:36	1
Naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:37	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
fed	1
thee?	1
or	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
gave	1
thee	1
drink?	1
	1
25:38	1
When	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
took	1
thee	1
in?	1
or	1
naked,	1
and	1
clothed	1
thee?	1
	1
25:39	1
Or	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:40	1
And	1
the	1
King	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:41	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
cursed,	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire,	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
his	1
angels:	1
25:42	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
drink:	1
25:43	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not	1
in:	1
naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me	1
not:	1
sick,	1
and	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
25:44	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
also	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
or	1
athirst,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
naked,	1
or	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:45	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
answer	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these,	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
25:46	1
And	1
these	1
shall	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
everlasting	1
punishment:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
into	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
26:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
is	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
26:3	1
Then	1
assembled	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
unto	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Caiaphas,	1
26:4	1
And	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
Jesus	1
by	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
26:5	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:6	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
in	1
Bethany,	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
26:7	1
There	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
very	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat.	1
	1
26:8	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
had	1
indignation,	1
saying,	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
is	1
this	1
waste?	1
	1
26:9	1
For	1
this	1
ointment	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
much,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
26:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
understood	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
the	1
woman?	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
26:11	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
26:12	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
poured	1
this	1
ointment	1
on	1
my	1
body,	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
burial.	1
	1
26:13	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
this,	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
done,	1
be	1
told	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
26:14	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
give	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
you?	1
And	1
they	1
covenanted	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
26:16	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
26:17	1
Now	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
thy	1
house	1
with	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
26:20	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
began	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
dippeth	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:24	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
26:25	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
26:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
eating,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat;	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Drink	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
it;	1
26:28	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
26:29	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
henceforth	1
of	1
this	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
kingdom.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
26:31	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
26:32	1
But	1
after	1
I	1
am	1
risen	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:33	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
never	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
26:34	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
26:35	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
deny	1
thee.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:36	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Gethsemane,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
pray	1
yonder.	1
	1
26:37	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
very	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:38	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
even	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:39	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
let	1
this	1
cup	1
pass	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
26:40	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
asleep,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
What,	1
could	1
ye	1
not	1
watch	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
26:41	1
Watch	1
and	1
pray,	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation:	1
the	1
spirit	1
indeed	1
is	1
willing,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
26:42	1
He	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
this	1
cup	1
may	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
except	1
I	1
drink	1
it,	1
thy	1
will	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
26:43	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again:	1
for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:44	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
again,	1
and	1
prayed	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
26:45	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
26:46	1
Rise,	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
going:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
doth	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
lo,	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:48	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
sign,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he:	1
hold	1
him	1
fast.	1
	1
26:49	1
And	1
forthwith	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
26:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
wherefore	1
art	1
thou	1
come?	1
Then	1
came	1
they,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
Jesus	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
26:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
struck	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest's,	1
and	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
26:52	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
up	1
again	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
his	1
place:	1
for	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:53	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
now	1
pray	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
presently	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
twelve	1
legions	1
of	1
angels?	1
	1
26:54	1
But	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
scriptures	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
thus	1
it	1
must	1
be?	1
	1
26:55	1
In	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
I	1
sat	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
ye	1
laid	1
no	1
hold	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
26:56	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
disciples	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
26:57	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
Jesus	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
where	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
assembled.	1
	1
26:58	1
But	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
palace,	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
26:59	1
Now	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council,	1
sought	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
26:60	1
But	1
found	1
none:	1
yea,	1
though	1
many	1
false	1
witnesses	1
came,	1
yet	1
found	1
they	1
none.	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
came	1
two	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
26:61	1
And	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
26:62	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
arose,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
26:63	1
But	1
Jesus	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
26:64	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
26:65	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
spoken	1
blasphemy;	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
have	1
we	1
of	1
witnesses?	1
behold,	1
now	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
26:66	1
What	1
think	1
ye?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
26:67	1
Then	1
did	1
they	1
spit	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
buffeted	1
him;	1
and	1
others	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
26:68	1
Saying,	1
Prophesy	1
unto	1
us,	1
thou	1
Christ,	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
26:69	1
Now	1
Peter	1
sat	1
without	1
in	1
the	1
palace:	1
and	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:70	1
But	1
he	1
denied	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
26:71	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch,	1
another	1
maid	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
This	1
fellow	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:72	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
denied	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
26:73	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
also	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
thy	1
speech	1
bewrayeth	1
thee.	1
	1
26:74	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
man.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
26:75	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
27:1	1
When	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
come,	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
counsel	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
27:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
bound	1
him,	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
27:3	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
had	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
condemned,	1
repented	1
himself,	1
and	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
27:4	1
Saying,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
us?	1
see	1
thou	1
to	1
that.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hanged	1
himself.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
took	1
the	1
silver	1
pieces,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
treasury,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
counsel,	1
and	1
bought	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
to	1
bury	1
strangers	1
in.	1
	1
27:8	1
Wherefore	1
that	1
field	1
was	1
called,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:9	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
valued,	1
whom	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
value;	1
27:10	1
And	1
gave	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
appointed	1
me.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
governor:	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
not	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
to	1
never	1
a	1
word;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
marvelled	1
greatly.	1
	1
27:15	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
release	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
whom	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
a	1
notable	1
prisoner,	1
called	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:17	1
Therefore	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
Barabbas,	1
or	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
	1
27:18	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
envy	1
they	1
had	1
delivered	1
him.	1
	1
27:19	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
his	1
wife	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
thou	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
just	1
man:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
27:20	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
persuaded	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
Barabbas,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Jesus.	1
	1
27:21	1
The	1
governor	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
of	1
the	1
twain	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
They	1
said,	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:22	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
then	1
with	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
They	1
all	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:23	1
And	1
the	1
governor	1
said,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:24	1
When	1
Pilate	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
prevail	1
nothing,	1
but	1
that	1
rather	1
a	1
tumult	1
was	1
made,	1
he	1
took	1
water,	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
innocent	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
this	1
just	1
person:	1
see	1
ye	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
27:25	1
Then	1
answered	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
His	1
blood	1
be	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
children.	1
	1
27:26	1
Then	1
released	1
he	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:27	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
took	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
common	1
hall,	1
and	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
band	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
	1
27:28	1
And	1
they	1
stripped	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
scarlet	1
robe.	1
	1
27:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
they	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
reed	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
robe	1
off	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
raiment	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
Simon	1
by	1
name:	1
him	1
they	1
compelled	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Golgotha,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
27:34	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
vinegar	1
to	1
drink	1
mingled	1
with	1
gall:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tasted	1
thereof,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
garments	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
vesture	1
did	1
they	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
27:36	1
And	1
sitting	1
down	1
they	1
watched	1
him	1
there;	1
27:37	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
accusation	1
written,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
JESUS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
27:38	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
two	1
thieves	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
reviled	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
27:40	1
And	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
27:41	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
elders,	1
said,	1
27:42	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
him	1
now	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
27:43	1
He	1
trusted	1
in	1
God;	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
him	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:44	1
The	1
thieves	1
also,	1
which	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
his	1
teeth.	1
	1
27:45	1
Now	1
from	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
27:46	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eli,	1
Eli,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
27:47	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
calleth	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
27:48	1
And	1
straightway	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
ran,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
spunge,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
27:49	1
The	1
rest	1
said,	1
Let	1
be,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
him.	1
	1
27:50	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
27:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
quake,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
rent;	1
27:52	1
And	1
the	1
graves	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
many	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
slept	1
arose,	1
27:53	1
And	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
graves	1
after	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
appeared	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
27:54	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
watching	1
Jesus,	1
saw	1
the	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done,	1
they	1
feared	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
Truly	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:55	1
And	1
many	1
women	1
were	1
there	1
beholding	1
afar	1
off,	1
which	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
ministering	1
unto	1
him:	1
27:56	1
Among	1
which	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children.	1
	1
27:57	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
was	1
Jesus'	1
disciple:	1
27:58	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
commanded	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
27:59	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
body,	1
he	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
27:60	1
And	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
new	1
tomb,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hewn	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
rock:	1
and	1
he	1
rolled	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
27:61	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary,	1
sitting	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
27:62	1
Now	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
preparation,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
27:63	1
Saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
remember	1
that	1
that	1
deceiver	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
After	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
27:64	1
Command	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
be	1
made	1
sure	1
until	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
lest	1
his	1
disciples	1
come	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
steal	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
He	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
so	1
the	1
last	1
error	1
shall	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
27:65	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
a	1
watch:	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
ye	1
can.	1
	1
27:66	1
So	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
sure,	1
sealing	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
setting	1
a	1
watch.	1
	1
28:1	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
as	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
toward	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
came	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
28:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake:	1
for	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
descended	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
rolled	1
back	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
28:3	1
His	1
countenance	1
was	1
like	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
white	1
as	1
snow:	1
28:4	1
And	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
keepers	1
did	1
shake,	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
women,	1
Fear	1
not	1
ye:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
seek	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
28:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
risen,	1
as	1
he	1
said.	1
Come,	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Lord	1
lay.	1
	1
28:7	1
And	1
go	1
quickly,	1
and	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him:	1
lo,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
quickly	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
great	1
joy;	1
and	1
did	1
run	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
disciples	1
word.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples,	1
behold,	1
Jesus	1
met	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
hail.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
28:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid:	1
go	1
tell	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
me.	1
	1
28:11	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
behold,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
watch	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shewed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
counsel,	1
they	1
gave	1
large	1
money	1
unto	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
28:13	1
Saying,	1
Say	1
ye,	1
His	1
disciples	1
came	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
stole	1
him	1
away	1
while	1
we	1
slept.	1
	1
28:14	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
governor's	1
ears,	1
we	1
will	1
persuade	1
him,	1
and	1
secure	1
you.	1
	1
28:15	1
So	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
taught:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
is	1
commonly	1
reported	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:16	1
Then	1
the	1
eleven	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
where	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
but	1
some	1
doubted.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
power	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
28:19	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
teach	1
all	1
nations,	1
baptizing	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
28:20	1
Teaching	1
them	1
to	1
observe	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you	1
alway,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Mark	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
1:2	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
did	1
baptize	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
John	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
girdle	1
of	1
a	1
skin	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey;	1
1:7	1
And	1
preached,	1
saying,	1
There	1
cometh	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
after	1
me,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
stoop	1
down	1
and	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
indeed	1
have	1
baptized	1
you	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
came	1
from	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized	1
of	1
John	1
in	1
Jordan.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
like	1
a	1
dove	1
descending	1
upon	1
him:	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
spirit	1
driveth	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
days,	1
tempted	1
of	1
Satan;	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts;	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
1:14	1
Now	1
after	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
prison,	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
1:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
fulfilled,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
repent	1
ye,	1
and	1
believe	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
saw	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
become	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
straightway	1
they	1
forsook	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
mending	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
called	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
their	1
father	1
Zebedee	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
the	1
hired	1
servants,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
Capernaum;	1
and	1
straightway	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
1:24	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
had	1
torn	1
him,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:27	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
questioned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thing	1
is	1
this?	1
what	1
new	1
doctrine	1
is	1
this?	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
commandeth	1
he	1
even	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
fame	1
spread	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Galilee.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
forthwith,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever,	1
and	1
anon	1
they	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up;	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
at	1
even,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
set,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
he	1
healed	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick	1
of	1
divers	1
diseases,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils;	1
and	1
suffered	1
not	1
the	1
devils	1
to	1
speak,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him.	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
rising	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
before	1
day,	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
solitary	1
place,	1
and	1
there	1
prayed.	1
	1
1:36	1
And	1
Simon	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
followed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
men	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
towns,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preach	1
there	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues	1
throughout	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
1:40	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
to	1
him,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
and	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
him,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
sent	1
him	1
away;	1
1:44	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:45	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
much,	1
and	1
to	1
blaze	1
abroad	1
the	1
matter,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Jesus	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
was	1
without	1
in	1
desert	1
places:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
quarter.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum	1
after	1
some	1
days;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
noised	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
straightway	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
about	1
the	1
door:	1
and	1
he	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
bringing	1
one	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
which	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
four.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
they	1
uncovered	1
the	1
roof	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
it	1
up,	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
bed	1
wherein	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy	1
lay.	1
	1
2:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Son,	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
sitting	1
there,	1
and	1
reasoning	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
2:7	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
thus	1
speak	1
blasphemies?	1
who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins	1
but	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
immediately	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
that	1
they	1
so	1
reasoned	1
within	1
themselves,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
2:9	1
Whether	1
is	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
2:11	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
arose,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
before	1
them	1
all;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
We	1
never	1
saw	1
it	1
on	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
Levi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
sat	1
also	1
together	1
with	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
him	1
eat	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
2:17	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
used	1
to	1
fast:	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
cannot	1
fast.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
2:21	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
seweth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
garment:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
piece	1
that	1
filled	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
doth	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
is	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
will	1
be	1
marred:	1
but	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
began,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful?	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
need,	1
and	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
he,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:26	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
sabbath	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
sabbath:	1
2:28	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
there	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
withered	1
hand.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Stand	1
forth.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
kill?	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
with	1
anger,	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
out:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
Jesus	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
from	1
Galilee	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
3:8	1
And	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Idumaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
they	1
about	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
did,	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
ship	1
should	1
wait	1
on	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
throng	1
him.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
healed	1
many;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
touch	1
him,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
had	1
plagues.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
goeth	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
calleth	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
would:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
he	1
ordained	1
twelve,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
to	1
preach,	1
3:15	1
And	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
heal	1
sicknesses,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
3:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
he	1
surnamed	1
Peter;	1
3:17	1
And	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James;	1
and	1
he	1
surnamed	1
them	1
Boanerges,	1
which	1
is,	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
thunder:	1
3:18	1
And	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Thaddaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
3:19	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
cometh	1
together	1
again,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
friends	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
beside	1
himself.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
Beelzebub,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
casteth	1
he	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
How	1
can	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan?	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
kingdom	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
kingdom	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
house	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
house	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
himself,	1
and	1
be	1
divided,	1
he	1
cannot	1
stand,	1
but	1
hath	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
3:27	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
will	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
sins	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
blasphemies	1
wherewith	1
soever	1
they	1
shall	1
blaspheme:	1
3:29	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
blaspheme	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
never	1
forgiveness,	1
but	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
eternal	1
damnation.	1
	1
3:30	1
Because	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:31	1
There	1
came	1
then	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and,	1
standing	1
without,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
calling	1
him.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
without	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:33	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother,	1
or	1
my	1
brethren?	1
3:34	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
	1
3:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
teach	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
4:3	1
Hearken;	1
Behold,	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
sower	1
to	1
sow:	1
4:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
on	1
stony	1
ground,	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth;	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
sprang	1
up,	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
depth	1
of	1
earth:	1
4:6	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
it	1
was	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
it	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
yielded	1
no	1
fruit.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
did	1
yield	1
fruit	1
that	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
increased;	1
and	1
brought	1
forth,	1
some	1
thirty,	1
and	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
twelve	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
parables:	1
4:12	1
That	1
seeing	1
they	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
may	1
hear,	1
and	1
not	1
understand;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
this	1
parable?	1
and	1
how	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
parables?	1
	1
4:14	1
The	1
sower	1
soweth	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
where	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
sown;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
Satan	1
cometh	1
immediately,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
likewise	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
stony	1
ground;	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
immediately	1
receive	1
it	1
with	1
gladness;	1
4:17	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
root	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
endure	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
time:	1
afterward,	1
when	1
affliction	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
for	1
the	1
word's	1
sake,	1
immediately	1
they	1
are	1
offended.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
among	1
thorns;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
entering	1
in,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
good	1
ground;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
receive	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
thirtyfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
a	1
candle	1
brought	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
or	1
under	1
a	1
bed?	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
hid,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
manifested;	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
thing	1
kept	1
secret,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
4:23	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
ye	1
hear:	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you:	1
and	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
more	1
be	1
given.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
cast	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
ground;	1
4:27	1
And	1
should	1
sleep,	1
and	1
rise	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
spring	1
and	1
grow	1
up,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how.	1
	1
4:28	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
of	1
herself;	1
first	1
the	1
blade,	1
then	1
the	1
ear,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
ear.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fruit	1
is	1
brought	1
forth,	1
immediately	1
he	1
putteth	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
we	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
or	1
with	1
what	1
comparison	1
shall	1
we	1
compare	1
it?	1
	1
4:31	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
seeds	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:32	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown,	1
it	1
groweth	1
up,	1
and	1
becometh	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
herbs,	1
and	1
shooteth	1
out	1
great	1
branches;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
may	1
lodge	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
such	1
parables	1
spake	1
he	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
4:34	1
But	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone,	1
he	1
expounded	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
pass	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
with	1
him	1
other	1
little	1
ships.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
of	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
beat	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
full.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
asleep	1
on	1
a	1
pillow:	1
and	1
they	1
awake	1
him,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
carest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
perish?	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
Peace,	1
be	1
still.	1
And	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
4:40	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
so	1
fearful?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
faith?	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
they	1
feared	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him?	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
immediately	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
5:3	1
Who	1
had	1
his	1
dwelling	1
among	1
the	1
tombs;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
bind	1
him,	1
no,	1
not	1
with	1
chains:	1
5:4	1
Because	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
often	1
bound	1
with	1
fetters	1
and	1
chains,	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
had	1
been	1
plucked	1
asunder	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
fetters	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces:	1
neither	1
could	1
any	1
man	1
tame	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
always,	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
tombs,	1
crying,	1
and	1
cutting	1
himself	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
afar	1
off,	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
5:7	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God?	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
thou	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Legion:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
many.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
he	1
besought	1
him	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
5:11	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
mountains	1
a	1
great	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
swine,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
forthwith	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
them	1
leave.	1
And	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
(they	1
were	1
about	1
two	1
thousand;)	1
and	1
were	1
choked	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
the	1
swine	1
fled,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
legion,	1
sitting,	1
and	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
befell	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
swine.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
suffered	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
home	1
to	1
thy	1
friends,	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
hath	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
in	1
Decapolis	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
did	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
again	1
by	1
ship	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
much	1
people	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Jairus	1
by	1
name;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
5:23	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
My	1
little	1
daughter	1
lieth	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hands	1
on	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
healed;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
5:26	1
And	1
had	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
many	1
physicians,	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
and	1
was	1
nothing	1
bettered,	1
but	1
rather	1
grew	1
worse,	1
5:27	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
behind,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
5:28	1
For	1
she	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
touch	1
but	1
his	1
clothes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
was	1
dried	1
up;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
in	1
her	1
body	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
of	1
that	1
plague.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
immediately	1
knowing	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
virtue	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
turned	1
him	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
press,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
my	1
clothes?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
the	1
multitude	1
thronging	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
5:33	1
But	1
the	1
woman	1
fearing	1
and	1
trembling,	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
her,	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
be	1
whole	1
of	1
thy	1
plague.	1
	1
5:35	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead:	1
why	1
troublest	1
thou	1
the	1
Master	1
any	1
further?	1
	1
5:36	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
spoken,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
only	1
believe.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
tumult,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
wept	1
and	1
wailed	1
greatly.	1
	1
5:39	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
make	1
ye	1
this	1
ado,	1
and	1
weep?	1
the	1
damsel	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
he	1
taketh	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
entereth	1
in	1
where	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
lying.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
damsel	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Talitha	1
cumi;	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Damsel,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
arise.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
damsel	1
arose,	1
and	1
walked;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twelve	1
years.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
astonishment.	1
	1
5:43	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
straitly	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
many	1
hearing	1
him	1
were	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
From	1
whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
what	1
wisdom	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
even	1
such	1
mighty	1
works	1
are	1
wrought	1
by	1
his	1
hands?	1
	1
6:3	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
of	1
Juda,	1
and	1
Simon?	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
sisters	1
here	1
with	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
Jesus,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
kin,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
could	1
there	1
do	1
no	1
mighty	1
work,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
a	1
few	1
sick	1
folk,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
he	1
marvelled	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
villages,	1
teaching.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
by	1
two	1
and	1
two;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
over	1
unclean	1
spirits;	1
6:8	1
And	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
journey,	1
save	1
a	1
staff	1
only;	1
no	1
scrip,	1
no	1
bread,	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
purse:	1
6:9	1
But	1
be	1
shod	1
with	1
sandals;	1
and	1
not	1
put	1
on	1
two	1
coats.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
In	1
what	1
place	1
soever	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
depart	1
from	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
thence,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
preached	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
repent.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils,	1
and	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
king	1
Herod	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
(for	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
spread	1
abroad:)	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
Elias.	1
And	1
others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:16	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
John,	1
whom	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
6:17	1
For	1
Herod	1
himself	1
had	1
sent	1
forth	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
her.	1
	1
6:18	1
For	1
John	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Herod,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
thy	1
brother's	1
wife.	1
	1
6:19	1
Therefore	1
Herodias	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
him;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not:	1
6:20	1
For	1
Herod	1
feared	1
John,	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
holy,	1
and	1
observed	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
convenient	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
that	1
Herod	1
on	1
his	1
birthday	1
made	1
a	1
supper	1
to	1
his	1
lords,	1
high	1
captains,	1
and	1
chief	1
estates	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
6:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
Herodias	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
danced,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel,	1
Ask	1
of	1
me	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee,	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
mother,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
ask?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
straightway	1
with	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
asked,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
give	1
me	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
charger	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:26	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
exceeding	1
sorry;	1
yet	1
for	1
his	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
reject	1
her.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
an	1
executioner,	1
and	1
commanded	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
brought:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
beheaded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
6:28	1
And	1
brought	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
the	1
damsel	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
corpse,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
tomb.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
things,	1
both	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
taught.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
apart	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
rest	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
coming	1
and	1
going,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
by	1
ship	1
privately.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
them	1
departing,	1
and	1
many	1
knew	1
him,	1
and	1
ran	1
afoot	1
thither	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
cities,	1
and	1
outwent	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
saw	1
much	1
people,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
many	1
things.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
now	1
far	1
spent,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
far	1
passed:	1
6:36	1
Send	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
bread:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:38	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
go	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
knew,	1
they	1
say,	1
Five,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
companies	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
grass.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
ranks,	1
by	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
by	1
fifties.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes	1
divided	1
he	1
among	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:43	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fragments,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:44	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
6:45	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
before	1
unto	1
Bethsaida,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
6:47	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
6:48	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
toiling	1
in	1
rowing;	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
supposed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
spirit,	1
and	1
cried	1
out:	1
6:50	1
For	1
they	1
all	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
troubled.	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
amazed	1
in	1
themselves	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
and	1
wondered.	1
	1
6:52	1
For	1
they	1
considered	1
not	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
the	1
loaves:	1
for	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened.	1
	1
6:53	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
and	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
6:54	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
straightway	1
they	1
knew	1
him,	1
6:55	1
And	1
ran	1
through	1
that	1
whole	1
region	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
carry	1
about	1
in	1
beds	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
where	1
they	1
heard	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
6:56	1
And	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
entered,	1
into	1
villages,	1
or	1
cities,	1
or	1
country,	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
sick	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
touch	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
him	1
were	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
defiled,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
with	1
unwashen,	1
hands,	1
they	1
found	1
fault.	1
	1
7:3	1
For	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Jews,	1
except	1
they	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
oft,	1
eat	1
not,	1
holding	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
market,	1
except	1
they	1
wash,	1
they	1
eat	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
there	1
be,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
to	1
hold,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
cups,	1
and	1
pots,	1
brasen	1
vessels,	1
and	1
of	1
tables.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
asked	1
him,	1
Why	1
walk	1
not	1
thy	1
disciples	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
but	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands?	1
	1
7:6	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Well	1
hath	1
Esaias	1
prophesied	1
of	1
you	1
hypocrites,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
This	1
people	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips,	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
7:7	1
Howbeit	1
in	1
vain	1
do	1
they	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
hold	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
pots	1
and	1
cups:	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Full	1
well	1
ye	1
reject	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
keep	1
your	1
own	1
tradition.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother;	1
and,	1
Whoso	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death:	1
7:11	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
Corban,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
ye	1
suffer	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
ought	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother;	1
7:13	1
Making	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
through	1
your	1
tradition,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
delivered:	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
understand:	1
7:15	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
from	1
without	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
entering	1
into	1
him	1
can	1
defile	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
those	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
without	1
understanding	1
also?	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
perceive,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
from	1
without	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
man,	1
it	1
cannot	1
defile	1
him;	1
7:19	1
Because	1
it	1
entereth	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
goeth	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught,	1
purging	1
all	1
meats?	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
defileth	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:21	1
For	1
from	1
within,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
men,	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
murders,	1
7:22	1
Thefts,	1
covetousness,	1
wickedness,	1
deceit,	1
lasciviousness,	1
an	1
evil	1
eye,	1
blasphemy,	1
pride,	1
foolishness:	1
7:23	1
All	1
these	1
evil	1
things	1
come	1
from	1
within,	1
and	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it:	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
7:25	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
whose	1
young	1
daughter	1
had	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet:	1
7:26	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
a	1
Greek,	1
a	1
Syrophenician	1
by	1
nation;	1
and	1
she	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
devil	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Let	1
the	1
children	1
first	1
be	1
filled:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yes,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
children's	1
crumbs.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
For	1
this	1
saying	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
house,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
devil	1
gone	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
again,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Decapolis.	1
	1
7:32	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
deaf,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
impediment	1
in	1
his	1
speech;	1
and	1
they	1
beseech	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
fingers	1
into	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
he	1
spit,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
tongue;	1
7:34	1
And	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
sighed,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ephphatha,	1
that	1
is,	1
Be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
straightway	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
his	1
tongue	1
was	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
plain.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
they	1
published	1
it;	1
7:37	1
And	1
were	1
beyond	1
measure	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
done	1
all	1
things	1
well:	1
he	1
maketh	1
both	1
the	1
deaf	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
multitude	1
being	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
8:2	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
8:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
houses,	1
they	1
will	1
faint	1
by	1
the	1
way:	1
for	1
divers	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
from	1
far.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
answered	1
him,	1
From	1
whence	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
satisfy	1
these	1
men	1
with	1
bread	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
small	1
fishes:	1
and	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
also	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
four	1
thousand:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Dalmanutha.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
with	1
him,	1
seeking	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven,	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
in	1
his	1
spirit,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
generation	1
seek	1
after	1
a	1
sign?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
again	1
departed	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread,	1
neither	1
had	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
loaf.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
Herod.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
bread?	1
perceive	1
ye	1
not	1
yet,	1
neither	1
understand?	1
have	1
ye	1
your	1
heart	1
yet	1
hardened?	1
	1
8:18	1
Having	1
eyes,	1
see	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
having	1
ears,	1
hear	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember?	1
	1
8:19	1
When	1
I	1
brake	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
among	1
five	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Twelve.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
among	1
four	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand?	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
Bethsaida;	1
and	1
they	1
bring	1
a	1
blind	1
man	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
touch	1
him.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spit	1
on	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
ought.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
men	1
as	1
trees,	1
walking.	1
	1
8:25	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
again	1
upon	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
up:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
restored,	1
and	1
saw	1
every	1
man	1
clearly.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Neither	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
nor	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi:	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
And	1
Peter	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
that	1
saying	1
openly.	1
And	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him.	1
	1
8:33	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
Peter,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
also,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
8:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
8:36	1
For	1
what	1
shall	1
it	1
profit	1
a	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
	1
8:37	1
Or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
8:38	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
this	1
adulterous	1
and	1
sinful	1
generation;	1
of	1
him	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stand	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
come	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart	1
by	1
themselves:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
his	1
raiment	1
became	1
shining,	1
exceeding	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
so	1
as	1
no	1
fuller	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
white	1
them.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Elias	1
with	1
Moses:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
9:6	1
For	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
more,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only	1
with	1
themselves.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
had	1
seen,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
were	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
that	1
saying	1
with	1
themselves,	1
questioning	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
the	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
should	1
mean.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
Elias	1
verily	1
cometh	1
first,	1
and	1
restoreth	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
indeed	1
come,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
questioning	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
straightway	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
him,	1
were	1
greatly	1
amazed,	1
and	1
running	1
to	1
him	1
saluted	1
him.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
scribes,	1
What	1
question	1
ye	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
unto	1
thee	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
hath	1
a	1
dumb	1
spirit;	1
9:18	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
taketh	1
him,	1
he	1
teareth	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
foameth,	1
and	1
gnasheth	1
with	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
pineth	1
away:	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:19	1
He	1
answereth	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
O	1
faithless	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
straightway	1
the	1
spirit	1
tare	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
wallowed	1
foaming.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
father,	1
How	1
long	1
is	1
it	1
ago	1
since	1
this	1
came	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
ofttimes	1
it	1
hath	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
waters,	1
to	1
destroy	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
any	1
thing,	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
9:23	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
canst	1
believe,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
tears,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe;	1
help	1
thou	1
mine	1
unbelief.	1
	1
9:25	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
running	1
together,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
the	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
dumb	1
and	1
deaf	1
spirit,	1
I	1
charge	1
thee,	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
enter	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
cried,	1
and	1
rent	1
him	1
sore,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
one	1
dead;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
many	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
arose.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
kind	1
can	1
come	1
forth	1
by	1
nothing,	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
killed,	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum:	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
disputed	1
among	1
yourselves	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
had	1
disputed	1
among	1
themselves,	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
first,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
last	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
9:37	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
of	1
such	1
children	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me,	1
receiveth	1
not	1
me,	1
but	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us.	1
	1
9:39	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
which	1
shall	1
do	1
a	1
miracle	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
can	1
lightly	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
9:40	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
on	1
our	1
part.	1
	1
9:41	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
water	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
because	1
ye	1
belong	1
to	1
Christ,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
maimed,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:44	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:45	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
halt	1
into	1
life,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:46	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire:	1
9:48	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:49	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
every	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
salt.	1
	1
9:50	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
saltness,	1
wherewith	1
will	1
ye	1
season	1
it?	1
Have	1
salt	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
have	1
peace	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
by	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
resort	1
unto	1
him	1
again;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife?	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
did	1
Moses	1
command	1
you?	1
10:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Moses	1
suffered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
For	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
he	1
wrote	1
you	1
this	1
precept.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
God	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female.	1
	1
10:7	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife;	1
10:8	1
And	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh:	1
so	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:9	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
matter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
she	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
young	1
children	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
touch	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
those	1
that	1
brought	1
them.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
displeased,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suffer	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
running,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
10:19	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Defraud	1
not,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
observed	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
beholding	1
him	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
One	1
thing	1
thou	1
lackest:	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
sell	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
sad	1
at	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
grieved:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
words.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answereth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
how	1
hard	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
riches	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
saying	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looking	1
upon	1
them	1
saith,	1
With	1
men	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
God:	1
for	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
10:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
10:30	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
time,	1
houses,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
and	1
mothers,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
lands,	1
with	1
persecutions;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
10:31	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
first.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
amazed;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
followed,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
again	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
should	1
happen	1
unto	1
him,	1
10:33	1
Saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
10:34	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
mock	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
shall	1
desire.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
would	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
for	1
you?	1
10:37	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sit,	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
thy	1
left	1
hand,	1
in	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask:	1
can	1
ye	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of?	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
can.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
indeed	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
withal	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
baptized:	1
10:40	1
But	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
displeased	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
10:42	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
accounted	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
ones	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
10:43	1
But	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
minister:	1
10:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
chiefest,	1
shall	1
be	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
10:45	1
For	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
10:46	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jericho	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people,	1
blind	1
Bartimaeus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Timaeus,	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
highway	1
side	1
begging.	1
	1
10:47	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
out,	1
and	1
say,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
many	1
charged	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:49	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
And	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
blind	1
man,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
rise;	1
he	1
calleth	1
thee.	1
	1
10:50	1
And	1
he,	1
casting	1
away	1
his	1
garment,	1
rose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
10:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
The	1
blind	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
10:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
unto	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:2	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
entered	1
into	1
it,	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
never	1
man	1
sat;	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
this?	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
colt	1
tied	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
ways	1
met;	1
and	1
they	1
loose	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
do	1
ye,	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
colt	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
many	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
off	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna;	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
11:10	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
David,	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
eventide	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Bethany	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Bethany,	1
he	1
was	1
hungry:	1
11:13	1
And	1
seeing	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
afar	1
off	1
having	1
leaves,	1
he	1
came,	1
if	1
haply	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
any	1
thing	1
thereon:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
he	1
found	1
nothing	1
but	1
leaves;	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
figs	1
was	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
No	1
man	1
eat	1
fruit	1
of	1
thee	1
hereafter	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves;	1
11:16	1
And	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
carry	1
any	1
vessel	1
through	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer?	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
him,	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
by,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Peter	1
calling	1
to	1
remembrance	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
behold,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
which	1
thou	1
cursedst	1
is	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
faith	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
shall	1
believe	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saith	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
11:24	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
What	1
things	1
soever	1
ye	1
desire,	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
believe	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
them.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
stand	1
praying,	1
forgive,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
ought	1
against	1
any:	1
that	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
may	1
forgive	1
you	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:26	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
forgive,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
there	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
11:28	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
one	1
question,	1
and	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
11:30	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
counted	1
John,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
indeed.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
parables.	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
set	1
an	1
hedge	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
winefat,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
a	1
servant,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
another	1
servant;	1
and	1
at	1
him	1
they	1
cast	1
stones,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
shamefully	1
handled.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another;	1
and	1
him	1
they	1
killed,	1
and	1
many	1
others;	1
beating	1
some,	1
and	1
killing	1
some.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
yet	1
therefore	1
one	1
son,	1
his	1
wellbeloved,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
also	1
last	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
those	1
husbandmen	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
our's.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:9	1
What	1
shall	1
therefore	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do?	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
others.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
this	1
scripture;	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
12:11	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
the	1
parable	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
they	1
send	1
unto	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
carest	1
for	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
12:15	1
Shall	1
we	1
give,	1
or	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
give?	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
hypocrisy,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
penny,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
to	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
12:18	1
Then	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
12:19	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
a	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
and	1
leave	1
his	1
wife	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
12:20	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
dying	1
left	1
no	1
seed.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
died,	1
neither	1
left	1
he	1
any	1
seed:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
likewise.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her,	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
seed:	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
12:23	1
In	1
the	1
resurrection	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise,	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
err,	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
neither	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
12:25	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage;	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
rise:	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses,	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
bush	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
12:27	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
do	1
greatly	1
err.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
came,	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
them	1
reasoning	1
together,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
answered	1
them	1
well,	1
asked	1
him,	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
of	1
all?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
is,	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
The	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
one	1
Lord:	1
12:30	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like,	1
namely	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
commandment	1
greater	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
the	1
scribe	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
the	1
truth:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
but	1
he:	1
12:33	1
And	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
understanding,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
his	1
neighbour	1
as	1
himself,	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
whole	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
discreetly,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
that	1
durst	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
How	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:36	1
For	1
David	1
himself	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
12:37	1
David	1
therefore	1
himself	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whence	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
And	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
love	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
long	1
clothing,	1
and	1
love	1
salutations	1
in	1
the	1
marketplaces,	1
12:39	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts:	1
12:40	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
these	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
12:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
treasury,	1
and	1
beheld	1
how	1
the	1
people	1
cast	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
and	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
rich	1
cast	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow,	1
and	1
she	1
threw	1
in	1
two	1
mites,	1
which	1
make	1
a	1
farthing.	1
	1
12:43	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
more	1
in,	1
than	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
12:44	1
For	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
of	1
their	1
abundance;	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
want	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
even	1
all	1
her	1
living.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
see	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
what	1
buildings	1
are	1
here!	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
these	1
great	1
buildings?	1
	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
13:4	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
Take	1
heed	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
13:6	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars,	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
needs	1
be;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
yet.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
earthquakes	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines	1
and	1
troubles:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
13:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
councils;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
rulers	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
gospel	1
must	1
first	1
be	1
published	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
13:11	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
lead	1
you,	1
and	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
beforehand	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak,	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
premeditate:	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
hour,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
13:12	1
Now	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
betray	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
son;	1
and	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
standing	1
where	1
it	1
ought	1
not,	1
(let	1
him	1
that	1
readeth	1
understand,)	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains:	1
13:15	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
neither	1
enter	1
therein,	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
13:16	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
not	1
turn	1
back	1
again	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
13:17	1
But	1
woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter.	1
	1
13:19	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
affliction,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
which	1
God	1
created	1
unto	1
this	1
time,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shortened	1
those	1
days,	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
he	1
hath	1
shortened	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ;	1
or,	1
lo,	1
he	1
is	1
there;	1
believe	1
him	1
not:	1
13:22	1
For	1
false	1
Christs	1
and	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
to	1
seduce,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
even	1
the	1
elect.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
take	1
ye	1
heed:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
foretold	1
you	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:24	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
after	1
that	1
tribulation,	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
send	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
her	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
near:	1
13:29	1
So	1
ye	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nigh,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
13:30	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
13:31	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
13:32	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
13:33	1
Take	1
ye	1
heed,	1
watch	1
and	1
pray:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
is.	1
	1
13:34	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
Man	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taking	1
a	1
far	1
journey,	1
who	1
left	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
authority	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
porter	1
to	1
watch.	1
	1
13:35	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
cometh,	1
at	1
even,	1
or	1
at	1
midnight,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
cockcrowing,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
13:36	1
Lest	1
coming	1
suddenly	1
he	1
find	1
you	1
sleeping.	1
	1
13:37	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
all,	1
Watch.	1
	1
14:1	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
was	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
craft,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
Bethany	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard	1
very	1
precious;	1
and	1
she	1
brake	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
that	1
had	1
indignation	1
within	1
themselves,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
was	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
the	1
ointment	1
made?	1
	1
14:5	1
For	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
And	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone;	1
why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
her?	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
with	1
you	1
always,	1
and	1
whensoever	1
ye	1
will	1
ye	1
may	1
do	1
them	1
good:	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
14:8	1
She	1
hath	1
done	1
what	1
she	1
could:	1
she	1
is	1
come	1
aforehand	1
to	1
anoint	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
burying.	1
	1
14:9	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
this	1
also	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
conveniently	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover,	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
a	1
man	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water:	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
in,	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished	1
and	1
prepared:	1
there	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
One	1
of	1
you	1
which	1
eateth	1
with	1
me	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
and	1
another	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
that	1
dippeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish.	1
	1
14:21	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
indeed	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
good	1
were	1
it	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
drank	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
14:25	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
risen,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
14:29	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Although	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
yet	1
will	1
not	1
I.	1
	1
14:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
day,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
the	1
more	1
vehemently,	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deny	1
thee	1
in	1
any	1
wise.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
they	1
all.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
named	1
Gethsemane:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
shall	1
pray.	1
	1
14:33	1
And	1
he	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sore	1
amazed,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
heavy;	1
14:34	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
prayed	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
the	1
hour	1
might	1
pass	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Abba,	1
Father,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
unto	1
thee;	1
take	1
away	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
14:37	1
And	1
he	1
cometh,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
sleepest	1
thou?	1
couldest	1
not	1
thou	1
watch	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
14:38	1
Watch	1
ye	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
The	1
spirit	1
truly	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
14:39	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
spake	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
14:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
returned,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again,	1
(for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy,)	1
neither	1
wist	1
they	1
what	1
to	1
answer	1
him.	1
	1
14:41	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
it	1
is	1
enough,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
behold,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
14:42	1
Rise	1
up,	1
let	1
us	1
go;	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
14:43	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
cometh	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
14:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
token,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he;	1
take	1
him,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
safely.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
goeth	1
straightway	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
14:46	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
14:47	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
drew	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
smote	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
14:48	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
staves	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
	1
14:49	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
teaching,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
scriptures	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:50	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
14:51	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man,	1
having	1
a	1
linen	1
cloth	1
cast	1
about	1
his	1
naked	1
body;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
14:52	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
them	1
naked.	1
	1
14:53	1
And	1
they	1
led	1
Jesus	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
14:54	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
14:55	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council	1
sought	1
for	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
14:56	1
For	1
many	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
but	1
their	1
witness	1
agreed	1
not	1
together.	1
	1
14:57	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
certain,	1
and	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
saying,	1
14:58	1
We	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
temple	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
and	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
another	1
made	1
without	1
hands.	1
	1
14:59	1
But	1
neither	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
witness	1
agree	1
together.	1
	1
14:60	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
asked	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
14:61	1
But	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
Again	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Blessed?	1
	1
14:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
14:63	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
saith,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witnesses?	1
	1
14:64	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
blasphemy:	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
condemned	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
14:65	1
And	1
some	1
began	1
to	1
spit	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
to	1
buffet	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Prophesy:	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
did	1
strike	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:66	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
beneath	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
14:67	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter	1
warming	1
himself,	1
she	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
And	1
thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
14:68	1
But	1
he	1
denied,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
understand	1
I	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch;	1
and	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
14:69	1
And	1
a	1
maid	1
saw	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:70	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
it	1
again.	1
And	1
a	1
little	1
after,	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Galilaean,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
agreeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
14:71	1
But	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
speak.	1
	1
14:72	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
And	1
Peter	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
thereon,	1
he	1
wept.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
straightway	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
held	1
a	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
council,	1
and	1
bound	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
Jesus	1
yet	1
answered	1
nothing;	1
so	1
that	1
Pilate	1
marvelled.	1
	1
15:6	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
one	1
prisoner,	1
whomsoever	1
they	1
desired.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
named	1
Barabbas,	1
which	1
lay	1
bound	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
him,	1
who	1
had	1
committed	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
insurrection.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
crying	1
aloud	1
began	1
to	1
desire	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:10	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
had	1
delivered	1
him	1
for	1
envy.	1
	1
15:11	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
moved	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rather	1
release	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
again,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:14	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more	1
exceedingly,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
so	1
Pilate,	1
willing	1
to	1
content	1
the	1
people,	1
released	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
called	1
Praetorium;	1
and	1
they	1
call	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
band.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
they	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
purple,	1
and	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
15:18	1
And	1
began	1
to	1
salute	1
him,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
15:19	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
did	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
bowing	1
their	1
knees	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
purple	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
clothes	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
they	1
compel	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
who	1
passed	1
by,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Rufus,	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
Golgotha,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink	1
wine	1
mingled	1
with	1
myrrh:	1
but	1
he	1
received	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
him,	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots	1
upon	1
them,	1
what	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
take.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
they	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
the	1
superscription	1
of	1
his	1
accusation	1
was	1
written	1
over,	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
crucify	1
two	1
thieves;	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Ah,	1
thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
15:30	1
Save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
15:31	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
said	1
among	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
scribes,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
	1
15:32	1
Let	1
Christ	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
descend	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
and	1
believe.	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him	1
reviled	1
him.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eloi,	1
Eloi,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
calleth	1
Elias.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
one	1
ran	1
and	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
alone;	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
down.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
which	1
stood	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
he	1
said,	1
Truly	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
women	1
looking	1
on	1
afar	1
off:	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
the	1
less	1
and	1
of	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Salome;	1
15:41	1
(Who	1
also,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him;)	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
women	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:42	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
15:43	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
an	1
honourable	1
counsellor,	1
which	1
also	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
came,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
boldly	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
craved	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
15:44	1
And	1
Pilate	1
marvelled	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
dead:	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
while	1
dead.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
Joseph.	1
	1
15:46	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
which	1
was	1
hewn	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
rolled	1
a	1
stone	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
15:47	1
And	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Joses	1
beheld	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
was	1
past,	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Salome,	1
had	1
bought	1
sweet	1
spices,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
and	1
anoint	1
him.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
at	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
shall	1
roll	1
us	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre?	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
looked,	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
rolled	1
away:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
great.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
clothed	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
white	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
affrighted.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
affrighted:	1
Ye	1
seek	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified:	1
he	1
is	1
risen;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
behold	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
Peter	1
that	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
quickly,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
for	1
they	1
trembled	1
and	1
were	1
amazed:	1
neither	1
said	1
they	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
any	1
man;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
16:9	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
risen	1
early	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
he	1
appeared	1
first	1
to	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
seven	1
devils.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
they	1
mourned	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
her,	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
16:12	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
another	1
form	1
unto	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
walked,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
residue:	1
neither	1
believed	1
they	1
them.	1
	1
16:14	1
Afterward	1
he	1
appeared	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
and	1
upbraided	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
unbelief	1
and	1
hardness	1
of	1
heart,	1
because	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
risen.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
every	1
creature.	1
	1
16:16	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
damned.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
these	1
signs	1
shall	1
follow	1
them	1
that	1
believe;	1
In	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
devils;	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
new	1
tongues;	1
16:18	1
They	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
serpents;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
drink	1
any	1
deadly	1
thing,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
recover.	1
	1
16:19	1
So	1
then	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
preached	1
every	1
where,	1
the	1
Lord	1
working	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
confirming	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
signs	1
following.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Luke	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
many	1
have	1
taken	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
order	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
most	1
surely	1
believed	1
among	1
us,	1
1:2	1
Even	1
as	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
were	1
eyewitnesses,	1
and	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
word;	1
1:3	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
also,	1
having	1
had	1
perfect	1
understanding	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first,	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
order,	1
most	1
excellent	1
Theophilus,	1
1:4	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
those	1
things,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
instructed.	1
	1
1:5	1
THERE	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
named	1
Zacharias,	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Abia:	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
righteous	1
before	1
God,	1
walking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
blameless.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
child,	1
because	1
that	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
barren,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
were	1
now	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
course,	1
1:9	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
priest's	1
office,	1
his	1
lot	1
was	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
praying	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
when	1
Zacharias	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Zacharias:	1
for	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard;	1
and	1
thy	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
John.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness;	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
shall	1
drink	1
neither	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
Elias,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
disobedient	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
just;	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
a	1
people	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
Zacharias	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
Whereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
this?	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
Gabriel,	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
shew	1
thee	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings.	1
	1
1:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
dumb,	1
and	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
speak,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
performed,	1
because	1
thou	1
believest	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
their	1
season.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
waited	1
for	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
for	1
he	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
remained	1
speechless.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
ministration	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
he	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
his	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
conceived,	1
and	1
hid	1
herself	1
five	1
months,	1
saying,	1
1:25	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
dealt	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
wherein	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
me,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
reproach	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
the	1
angel	1
Gabriel	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
unto	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
named	1
Nazareth,	1
1:27	1
To	1
a	1
virgin	1
espoused	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Joseph,	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
virgin's	1
name	1
was	1
Mary.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
highly	1
favoured,	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
was	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
saying,	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
salutation	1
this	1
should	1
be.	1
	1
1:30	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Mary:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
favour	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:31	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive	1
in	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
1:32	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
David:	1
1:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
1:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Mary	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
How	1
shall	1
this	1
be,	1
seeing	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
a	1
man?	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
shall	1
overshadow	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
also	1
that	1
holy	1
thing	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:36	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
cousin	1
Elisabeth,	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
conceived	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
her	1
old	1
age:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
with	1
her,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
barren.	1
	1
1:37	1
For	1
with	1
God	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
handmaid	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
Mary	1
arose	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
with	1
haste,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Juda;	1
1:40	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
saluted	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Elisabeth	1
heard	1
the	1
salutation	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
her	1
womb;	1
and	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
1:42	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women,	1
and	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
womb.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
whence	1
is	1
this	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
my	1
Lord	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
1:44	1
For,	1
lo,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
salutation	1
sounded	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
my	1
womb	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
1:45	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
she	1
that	1
believed:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
My	1
soul	1
doth	1
magnify	1
the	1
Lord,	1
1:47	1
And	1
my	1
spirit	1
hath	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
God	1
my	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:48	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
regarded	1
the	1
low	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
handmaiden:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
from	1
henceforth	1
all	1
generations	1
shall	1
call	1
me	1
blessed.	1
	1
1:49	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
mighty	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
me	1
great	1
things;	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
1:50	1
And	1
his	1
mercy	1
is	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
1:51	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
strength	1
with	1
his	1
arm;	1
he	1
hath	1
scattered	1
the	1
proud	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:52	1
He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
exalted	1
them	1
of	1
low	1
degree.	1
	1
1:53	1
He	1
hath	1
filled	1
the	1
hungry	1
with	1
good	1
things;	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
empty	1
away.	1
	1
1:54	1
He	1
hath	1
holpen	1
his	1
servant	1
Israel,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
mercy;	1
1:55	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:56	1
And	1
Mary	1
abode	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:57	1
Now	1
Elisabeth's	1
full	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered;	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:58	1
And	1
her	1
neighbours	1
and	1
her	1
cousins	1
heard	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shewed	1
great	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
1:59	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
circumcise	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
him	1
Zacharias,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
1:60	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Not	1
so;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
John.	1
	1
1:61	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
1:62	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
called.	1
	1
1:63	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
wrote,	1
saying,	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
John.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
all.	1
	1
1:64	1
And	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
opened	1
immediately,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
praised	1
God.	1
	1
1:65	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
were	1
noised	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
of	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:66	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
them	1
laid	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
child	1
shall	1
this	1
be!	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
1:67	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
Zacharias	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
prophesied,	1
saying,	1
1:68	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
visited	1
and	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people,	1
1:69	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
an	1
horn	1
of	1
salvation	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
David;	1
1:70	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began:	1
1:71	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
hate	1
us;	1
1:72	1
To	1
perform	1
the	1
mercy	1
promised	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
his	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
1:73	1
The	1
oath	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
1:74	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
being	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
might	1
serve	1
him	1
without	1
fear,	1
1:75	1
In	1
holiness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
before	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
life.	1
	1
1:76	1
And	1
thou,	1
child,	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
prepare	1
his	1
ways;	1
1:77	1
To	1
give	1
knowledge	1
of	1
salvation	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins,	1
1:78	1
Through	1
the	1
tender	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
whereby	1
the	1
dayspring	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
hath	1
visited	1
us,	1
1:79	1
To	1
give	1
light	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
to	1
guide	1
our	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
1:80	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
deserts	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
shewing	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
decree	1
from	1
Caesar	1
Augustus	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
be	1
taxed.	1
	1
2:2	1
(And	1
this	1
taxing	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
when	1
Cyrenius	1
was	1
governor	1
of	1
Syria.)	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
all	1
went	1
to	1
be	1
taxed,	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Bethlehem;	1
(because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
lineage	1
of	1
David:)	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
taxed	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
espoused	1
wife,	1
being	1
great	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
there,	1
the	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
manger;	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
shepherds	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
keeping	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
flock	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
2:9	1
And,	1
lo,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shone	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
is	1
born	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
you;	1
Ye	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
babe	1
wrapped	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
host	1
praising	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
2:14	1
Glory	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
highest,	1
and	1
on	1
earth	1
peace,	1
good	1
will	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
into	1
heaven,	1
the	1
shepherds	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
go	1
even	1
unto	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
haste,	1
and	1
found	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
the	1
babe	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
they	1
made	1
known	1
abroad	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
them	1
concerning	1
this	1
child.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
wondered	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
shepherds.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
Mary	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
pondered	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
returned,	1
glorifying	1
and	1
praising	1
God	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
when	1
eight	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
for	1
the	1
circumcising	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
JESUS,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
named	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
conceived	1
in	1
the	1
womb.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purification	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
2:23	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Every	1
male	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
holy	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;)	1
2:24	1
And	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
A	1
pair	1
of	1
turtledoves,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons.	1
	1
2:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Simeon;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
devout,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord's	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
parents	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
2:28	1
Then	1
took	1
he	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
blessed	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
2:29	1
Lord,	1
now	1
lettest	1
thou	1
thy	1
servant	1
depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
2:30	1
For	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
2:31	1
Which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
people;	1
2:32	1
A	1
light	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
marvelled	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
Simeon	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
child	1
is	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
fall	1
and	1
rising	1
again	1
of	1
many	1
in	1
Israel;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
against;	1
2:35	1
(Yea,	1
a	1
sword	1
shall	1
pierce	1
through	1
thy	1
own	1
soul	1
also,)	1
that	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
many	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Anna,	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Phanuel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Aser:	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
age,	1
and	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
an	1
husband	1
seven	1
years	1
from	1
her	1
virginity;	1
2:37	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
of	1
about	1
fourscore	1
and	1
four	1
years,	1
which	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
but	1
served	1
God	1
with	1
fastings	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
she	1
coming	1
in	1
that	1
instant	1
gave	1
thanks	1
likewise	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
looked	1
for	1
redemption	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
performed	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
city	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:41	1
Now	1
his	1
parents	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
every	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
days,	1
as	1
they	1
returned,	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus	1
tarried	1
behind	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
not	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:44	1
But	1
they,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
went	1
a	1
day's	1
journey;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
him	1
among	1
their	1
kinsfolk	1
and	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
2:45	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
seeking	1
him.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
doctors,	1
both	1
hearing	1
them,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
questions.	1
	1
2:47	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
understanding	1
and	1
answers.	1
	1
2:48	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
amazed:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
thus	1
dealt	1
with	1
us?	1
behold,	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
thee	1
sorrowing.	1
	1
2:49	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
sought	1
me?	1
wist	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
my	1
Father's	1
business?	1
	1
2:50	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
and	1
was	1
subject	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
his	1
mother	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
increased	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
stature,	1
and	1
in	1
favour	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Tiberius	1
Caesar,	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Herod	1
being	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Ituraea	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Trachonitis,	1
and	1
Lysanias	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Abilene,	1
3:2	1
Annas	1
and	1
Caiaphas	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priests,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
John	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
preaching	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins;	1
3:4	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:5	1
Every	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
filled,	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
hill	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low;	1
and	1
the	1
crooked	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
smooth;	1
3:6	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
worthy	1
of	1
repentance,	1
and	1
begin	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
every	1
tree	1
therefore	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
then?	1
	1
3:11	1
He	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
two	1
coats,	1
let	1
him	1
impart	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
none;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
meat,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
likewise.	1
	1
3:12	1
Then	1
came	1
also	1
publicans	1
to	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Exact	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
appointed	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
likewise	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
violence	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
accuse	1
any	1
falsely;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
your	1
wages.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
expectation,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
mused	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
of	1
John,	1
whether	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
Christ,	1
or	1
not;	1
3:16	1
John	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
cometh,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:17	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
his	1
garner;	1
but	1
the	1
chaff	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
unquenchable.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
exhortation	1
preached	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
being	1
reproved	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
Herodias	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
Herod	1
had	1
done,	1
3:20	1
Added	1
yet	1
this	1
above	1
all,	1
that	1
he	1
shut	1
up	1
John	1
in	1
prison.	1
	1
3:21	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
baptized,	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
also	1
being	1
baptized,	1
and	1
praying,	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened,	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
descended	1
in	1
a	1
bodily	1
shape	1
like	1
a	1
dove	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
from	1
heaven,	1
which	1
said,	1

wilderness,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
forty	1
days	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
nothing:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ended,	1
he	1
afterward	1
hungered.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
this	1
stone	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
devil,	1
taking	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain,	1
shewed	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
this	1
power	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it.	1
	1
4:7	1
If	1
thou	1
therefore	1
wilt	1
worship	1
me,	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
thine.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down	1
from	1
hence:	1
4:10	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
over	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee:	1
4:11	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
the	1
temptation,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
being	1
glorified	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up:	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
custom	1
was,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
to	1
read.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
delivered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
book,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
4:18	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
anointed	1
me	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
brokenhearted,	1
to	1
preach	1
deliverance	1
to	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
recovering	1
of	1
sight	1
to	1
the	1
blind,	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bruised,	1
4:19	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
acceptable	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
minister,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
were	1
fastened	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
this	1
scripture	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
all	1
bare	1
him	1
witness,	1
and	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
gracious	1
words	1
which	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Joseph's	1
son?	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
will	1
surely	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
proverb,	1
Physician,	1
heal	1
thyself:	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
done	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
do	1
also	1
here	1
in	1
thy	1
country.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
No	1
prophet	1
is	1
accepted	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:25	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
many	1
widows	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Elias,	1
when	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
when	1
great	1
famine	1
was	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
4:26	1
But	1
unto	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
Elias	1
sent,	1
save	1
unto	1
Sarepta,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Sidon,	1
unto	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
widow.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
many	1
lepers	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Eliseus	1
the	1
prophet;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
cleansed,	1
saving	1
Naaman	1
the	1
Syrian.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wrath,	1
4:29	1
And	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
thrust	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
whereon	1
their	1
city	1
was	1
built,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
headlong.	1
	1
4:30	1
But	1
he	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
4:31	1
And	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
devil,	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
4:34	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
thrown	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
hurt	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
a	1
word	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
power	1
he	1
commandeth	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
every	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Simon's	1
house.	1
	1
And	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
fever;	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
her,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
fever;	1
and	1
it	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:40	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
setting,	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
any	1
sick	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
devils	1
also	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many,	1
crying	1
out,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
he	1
rebuking	1
them	1
suffered	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:42	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
stayed	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
4:43	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
must	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
other	1
cities	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
sent.	1
	1
4:44	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
5:2	1
And	1
saw	1
two	1
ships	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
lake:	1
but	1
the	1
fishermen	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
were	1
washing	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
was	1
Simon's,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
thrust	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
land.	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
5:4	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
speaking,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Launch	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
your	1
nets	1
for	1
a	1
draught.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Simon	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
have	1
toiled	1
all	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing:	1
nevertheless	1
at	1
thy	1
word	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
net.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
this	1
done,	1
they	1
inclosed	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes:	1
and	1
their	1
net	1
brake.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
they	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
their	1
partners,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
ship,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
filled	1
both	1
the	1
ships,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
sink.	1
	1
5:8	1
When	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
knees,	1
saying,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sinful	1
man,	1
O	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
astonished,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken:	1
5:10	1
And	1
so	1
was	1
also	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
which	1
were	1
partners	1
with	1
Simon.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
catch	1
men.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
ships	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
forsook	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
city,	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
leprosy:	1
who	1
seeing	1
Jesus	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will:	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
go,	1
and	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing,	1
according	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
went	1
there	1
a	1
fame	1
abroad	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
by	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
doctors	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
sitting	1
by,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
town	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
present	1
to	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
5:18	1
And,	1
behold,	1
men	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
palsy:	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
means	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
him	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
by	1
what	1
way	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
him	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
went	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
tiling	1
with	1
his	1
couch	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
before	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
reason,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
speaketh	1
blasphemies?	1
Who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
but	1
God	1
alone?	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
reason	1
ye	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
5:23	1
Whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
upon	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
couch,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
that	1
whereon	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
glorifying	1
God.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
fear,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
publican,	1
named	1
Levi,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
all,	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
Levi	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
of	1
others	1
that	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:30	1
But	1
their	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
murmured	1
against	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
5:32	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
5:33	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
fast	1
often,	1
and	1
make	1
prayers,	1
and	1
likewise	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees;	1
but	1
thine	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
5:35	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
5:36	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them;	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
garment	1
upon	1
an	1
old;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
then	1
both	1
the	1
new	1
maketh	1
a	1
rent,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
that	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
agreeth	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
old.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles;	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
will	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
be	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
5:38	1
But	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles;	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
5:39	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
having	1
drunk	1
old	1
wine	1
straightway	1
desireth	1
new:	1
for	1
he	1
saith,	1
The	1
old	1
is	1
better.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
sabbath	1
after	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
plucked	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
rubbing	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
said,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this,	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
himself	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
6:4	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
alone?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
That	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
on	1
another	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
and	1
taught:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
withered.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
an	1
accusation	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
and	1
stand	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
forth.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
looking	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
them	1
all,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
madness;	1
and	1
communed	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
continued	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
prayer	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
chose	1
twelve,	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
named	1
apostles;	1
6:14	1
Simon,	1
(whom	1
he	1
also	1
named	1
Peter,)	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
Philip	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
6:15	1
Matthew	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
called	1
Zelotes,	1
6:16	1
And	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
traitor.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
their	1
diseases;	1
6:18	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
sought	1
to	1
touch	1
him:	1
for	1
there	1
went	1
virtue	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
poor:	1
for	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:21	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
hunger	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
weep	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
laugh.	1
	1
6:22	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
separate	1
you	1
from	1
their	1
company,	1
and	1
shall	1
reproach	1
you,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
your	1
name	1
as	1
evil,	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man's	1
sake.	1
	1
6:23	1
Rejoice	1
ye	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
leap	1
for	1
joy:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
your	1
reward	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
manner	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:24	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
rich!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
your	1
consolation.	1
	1
6:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
full!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
hunger.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
laugh	1
now!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
mourn	1
and	1
weep.	1
	1
6:26	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
you!	1
for	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
false	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:27	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
hear,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
hate	1
you,	1
6:28	1
Bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
cheek	1
offer	1
also	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
cloak	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
thy	1
coat	1
also.	1
	1
6:30	1
Give	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
goods	1
ask	1
them	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
6:32	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
love	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
them.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
do	1
even	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
lend	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
hope	1
to	1
receive,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
lend	1
to	1
sinners,	1
to	1
receive	1
as	1
much	1
again.	1
	1
6:35	1
But	1
love	1
ye	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
lend,	1
hoping	1
for	1
nothing	1
again;	1
and	1
your	1
reward	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
kind	1
unto	1
the	1
unthankful	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
6:36	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
merciful,	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
is	1
merciful.	1
	1
6:37	1
Judge	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
judged:	1
condemn	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
condemned:	1
forgive,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven:	1
6:38	1
Give,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you;	1
good	1
measure,	1
pressed	1
down,	1
and	1
shaken	1
together,	1
and	1
running	1
over,	1
shall	1
men	1
give	1
into	1
your	1
bosom.	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
measure	1
that	1
ye	1
mete	1
withal	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind?	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
both	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch?	1
	1
6:40	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master:	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
perfect	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
perceivest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
6:42	1
Either	1
how	1
canst	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Brother,	1
let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
eye,	1
when	1
thou	1
thyself	1
beholdest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
cast	1
out	1
first	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye,	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
6:43	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
corrupt	1
fruit;	1
neither	1
doth	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
6:44	1
For	1
every	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
fruit.	1
For	1
of	1
thorns	1
men	1
do	1
not	1
gather	1
figs,	1
nor	1
of	1
a	1
bramble	1
bush	1
gather	1
they	1
grapes.	1
	1
6:45	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil:	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
his	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
why	1
call	1
ye	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
say?	1
	1
6:47	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
heareth	1
my	1
sayings,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
like:	1
6:48	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
built	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
digged	1
deep,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
a	1
rock:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
flood	1
arose,	1
the	1
stream	1
beat	1
vehemently	1
upon	1
that	1
house,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
it:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
heareth,	1
and	1
doeth	1
not,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
without	1
a	1
foundation	1
built	1
an	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
stream	1
did	1
beat	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
fell;	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
his	1
sayings	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
centurion's	1
servant,	1
who	1
was	1
dear	1
unto	1
him,	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
beseeching	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
instantly,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
worthy	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
this:	1
7:5	1
For	1
he	1
loveth	1
our	1
nation,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
us	1
a	1
synagogue.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
centurion	1
sent	1
friends	1
to	1
him,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
trouble	1
not	1
thyself:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
enter	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
7:7	1
Wherefore	1
neither	1
thought	1
I	1
myself	1
worthy	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
set	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
under	1
me	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
one,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
followed	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
found	1
the	1
servant	1
whole	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nain;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
much	1
people.	1
	1
7:12	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
carried	1
out,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Weep	1
not.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
bier:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
him	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Young	1
man,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
sat	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
fear	1
on	1
all:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
That	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
among	1
us;	1
and,	1
That	1
God	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
this	1
rumour	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
shewed	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
John	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
7:20	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
said,	1
John	1
Baptist	1
hath	1
sent	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
he	1
cured	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities	1
and	1
plagues,	1
and	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits;	1
and	1
unto	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
blind	1
he	1
gave	1
sight.	1
	1
7:22	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way,	1
and	1
tell	1
John	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard;	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
see,	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
John	1
were	1
departed,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
7:25	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
Behold,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
gorgeously	1
apparelled,	1
and	1
live	1
delicately,	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
courts.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
Yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:27	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
greater	1
prophet	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
publicans,	1
justified	1
God,	1
being	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
7:30	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
lawyers	1
rejected	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God	1
against	1
themselves,	1
being	1
not	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation?	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
like?	1
	1
7:32	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
and	1
calling	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
wept.	1
	1
7:33	1
For	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
bread	1
nor	1
drinking	1
wine;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
7:34	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
gluttonous	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners!	1
7:35	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
eat	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
7:37	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
sinner,	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
brought	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment,	1
7:38	1
And	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
behind	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
anointed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:39	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
which	1
had	1
bidden	1
him	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
spake	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
prophet,	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
woman	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
toucheth	1
him:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
7:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Simon,	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
7:41	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
creditor	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
debtors:	1
the	1
one	1
owed	1
five	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
fifty.	1
	1
7:42	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
pay,	1
he	1
frankly	1
forgave	1
them	1
both.	1
Tell	1
me	1
therefore,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
love	1
him	1
most?	1
	1
7:43	1
Simon	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
he,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
forgave	1
most.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
rightly	1
judged.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
this	1
woman?	1
I	1
entered	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
my	1
feet:	1
but	1
she	1
hath	1
washed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
wiped	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
7:45	1
Thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
kiss:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
hath	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
kiss	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
7:46	1
My	1
head	1
with	1
oil	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
anoint:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
anointed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:47	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Her	1
sins,	1
which	1
are	1
many,	1
are	1
forgiven;	1
for	1
she	1
loved	1
much:	1
but	1
to	1
whom	1
little	1
is	1
forgiven,	1
the	1
same	1
loveth	1
little.	1
	1
7:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven.	1
	1
7:49	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
forgiveth	1
sins	1
also?	1
	1
7:50	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
Thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
throughout	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
village,	1
preaching	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
8:2	1
And	1
certain	1
women,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
healed	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits	1
and	1
infirmities,	1
Mary	1
called	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
went	1
seven	1
devils,	1
8:3	1
And	1
Joanna	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Chuza	1
Herod's	1
steward,	1
and	1
Susanna,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
which	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
substance.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
when	1
much	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
a	1
parable:	1
8:5	1
A	1
sower	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
sow	1
his	1
seed:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
trodden	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
devoured	1
it.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
upon	1
a	1
rock;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
it	1
withered	1
away,	1
because	1
it	1
lacked	1
moisture.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprang	1
up	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
choked	1
it.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
bare	1
fruit	1
an	1
hundredfold.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
cried,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
might	1
this	1
parable	1
be?	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
to	1
others	1
in	1
parables;	1
that	1
seeing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
the	1
parable	1
is	1
this:	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:12	1
Those	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear;	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
and	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
hear,	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
joy;	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
no	1
root,	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
believe,	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
temptation	1
fall	1
away.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
are	1
choked	1
with	1
cares	1
and	1
riches	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
bring	1
no	1
fruit	1
to	1
perfection.	1
	1
8:15	1
But	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
are	1
they,	1
which	1
in	1
an	1
honest	1
and	1
good	1
heart,	1
having	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
with	1
patience.	1
	1
8:16	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
covereth	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
vessel,	1
or	1
putteth	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bed;	1
but	1
setteth	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
enter	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
nothing	1
is	1
secret,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
manifest;	1
neither	1
any	1
thing	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
8:18	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
how	1
ye	1
hear:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seemeth	1
to	1
have.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake.	1
And	1
they	1
launched	1
forth.	1
	1
8:23	1
But	1
as	1
they	1
sailed	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep:	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
wind	1
on	1
the	1
lake;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
jeopardy.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
master,	1
we	1
perish.	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
raging	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
they	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
calm.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
faith?	1
And	1
they	1
being	1
afraid	1
wondered,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
he	1
commandeth	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
they	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes,	1
which	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Galilee.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
land,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
devils	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
ware	1
no	1
clothes,	1
neither	1
abode	1
in	1
any	1
house,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
tombs.	1
	1
8:28	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
most	1
high?	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:29	1
(For	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
For	1
oftentimes	1
it	1
had	1
caught	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
kept	1
bound	1
with	1
chains	1
and	1
in	1
fetters;	1
and	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
bands,	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.)	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Legion:	1
because	1
many	1
devils	1
were	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding	1
on	1
the	1
mountain:	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
them.	1
	1
8:33	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
devils	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
lake,	1
and	1
were	1
choked.	1
	1
8:34	1
When	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
them	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
done;	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
man,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
8:36	1
They	1
also	1
which	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
8:37	1
Then	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes	1
round	1
about	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
great	1
fear:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
returned	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
8:38	1
Now	1
the	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
8:39	1
Return	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
shew	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
published	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
8:40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
returned,	1
the	1
people	1
gladly	1
received	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
8:41	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Jairus,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
house:	1
8:42	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
only	1
daughter,	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
a	1
dying.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
people	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
8:43	1
And	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
which	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
her	1
living	1
upon	1
physicians,	1
neither	1
could	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
any,	1
8:44	1
Came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
immediately	1
her	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
stanched.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
When	1
all	1
denied,	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
said,	1
Master,	1
the	1
multitude	1
throng	1
thee	1
and	1
press	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
8:46	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Somebody	1
hath	1
touched	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
virtue	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:47	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
hid,	1
she	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
falling	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
she	1
declared	1
unto	1
him	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
what	1
cause	1
she	1
had	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
immediately.	1
	1
8:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:49	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house,	1
saying	1
to	1
him,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead;	1
trouble	1
not	1
the	1
Master.	1
	1
8:50	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
believe	1
only,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
8:51	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
go	1
in,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
maiden.	1
	1
8:52	1
And	1
all	1
wept,	1
and	1
bewailed	1
her:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
Weep	1
not;	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
8:53	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn,	1
knowing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
8:54	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
called,	1
saying,	1
Maid,	1
arise.	1
	1
8:55	1
And	1
her	1
spirit	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
arose	1
straightway:	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
meat.	1
	1
8:56	1
And	1
her	1
parents	1
were	1
astonished:	1
but	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
together,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
all	1
devils,	1
and	1
to	1
cure	1
diseases.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
sick.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
nothing	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
staves,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
neither	1
bread,	1
neither	1
money;	1
neither	1
have	1
two	1
coats	1
apiece.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter	1
into,	1
there	1
abide,	1
and	1
thence	1
depart.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
from	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
they	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
towns,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
where.	1
	1
9:7	1
Now	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
9:8	1
And	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
Elias	1
had	1
appeared;	1
and	1
of	1
others,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
was	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
Herod	1
said,	1
John	1
have	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
but	1
who	1
is	1
this,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
hear	1
such	1
things?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
apostles,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
returned,	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
aside	1
privately	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
called	1
Bethsaida.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
it,	1
followed	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
need	1
of	1
healing.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
wear	1
away,	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
lodge,	1
and	1
get	1
victuals:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
place.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
two	1
fishes;	1
except	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
meat	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Make	1
them	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
fifties	1
in	1
a	1
company.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
all	1
sit	1
down.	1
	1
9:16	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
filled:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
of	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
them	1
twelve	1
baskets.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
praying,	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
say	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
9:19	1
They	1
answering	1
said,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others	1
say,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
is	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:20	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
Peter	1
answering	1
said,	1
The	1
Christ	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thing;	1
9:22	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
slain,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross	1
daily,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
9:25	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
advantaged,	1
if	1
he	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
himself,	1
or	1
be	1
cast	1
away?	1
	1
9:26	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
glory,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
Father's,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
an	1
eight	1
days	1
after	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
took	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
prayed,	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
altered,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
glistering.	1
	1
9:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias:	1
9:31	1
Who	1
appeared	1
in	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
decease	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
accomplish	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
heavy	1
with	1
sleep:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
awake,	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
stood	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias:	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
9:34	1
While	1
he	1
thus	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
past,	1
Jesus	1
was	1
found	1
alone.	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
it	1
close,	1
and	1
told	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hill,	1
much	1
people	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
9:38	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
look	1
upon	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mine	1
only	1
child.	1
	1
9:39	1
And,	1
lo,	1
a	1
spirit	1
taketh	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
crieth	1
out;	1
and	1
it	1
teareth	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
foameth	1
again,	1
and	1
bruising	1
him	1
hardly	1
departeth	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
I	1
besought	1
thy	1
disciples	1
to	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
suffer	1
you?	1
Bring	1
thy	1
son	1
hither.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
coming,	1
the	1
devil	1
threw	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
tare	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
and	1
healed	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
mighty	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
But	1
while	1
they	1
wondered	1
every	1
one	1
at	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
9:44	1
Let	1
these	1
sayings	1
sink	1
down	1
into	1
your	1
ears:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:45	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
perceived	1
it	1
not:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
saying.	1
	1
9:46	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
reasoning	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
perceiving	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
by	1
him,	1
9:48	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
this	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
among	1
you	1
all,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
great.	1
	1
9:49	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name;	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
9:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
received	1
up,	1
he	1
stedfastly	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
9:52	1
And	1
sent	1
messengers	1
before	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans,	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
9:53	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:54	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
saw	1
this,	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
command	1
fire	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consume	1
them,	1
even	1
as	1
Elias	1
did?	1
	1
9:55	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
spirit	1
ye	1
are	1
of.	1
	1
9:56	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
men's	1
lives,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
another	1
village.	1
	1
9:57	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
9:58	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
9:59	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
another,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
9:60	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead:	1
but	1
go	1
thou	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:61	1
And	1
another	1
also	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee;	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
first	1
go	1
bid	1
them	1
farewell,	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
at	1
my	1
house.	1
	1
9:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
No	1
man,	1
having	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plough,	1
and	1
looking	1
back,	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
LORD	1
appointed	1
other	1
seventy	1
also,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
place,	1
whither	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
come.	1
	1
10:2	1
Therefore	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
great,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few:	1
pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:3	1
Go	1
your	1
ways:	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
lambs	1
among	1
wolves.	1
	1
10:4	1
Carry	1
neither	1
purse,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
nor	1
shoes:	1
and	1
salute	1
no	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter,	1
first	1
say,	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
house.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
there,	1
your	1
peace	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
it:	1
if	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
remain,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
give:	1
for	1
the	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
hire.	1
Go	1
not	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you,	1
eat	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
are	1
set	1
before	1
you:	1
10:9	1
And	1
heal	1
the	1
sick	1
that	1
are	1
therein,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:10	1
But	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you	1
not,	1
go	1
your	1
ways	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
say,	1
10:11	1
Even	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
city,	1
which	1
cleaveth	1
on	1
us,	1
we	1
do	1
wipe	1
off	1
against	1
you:	1
notwithstanding	1
be	1
ye	1
sure	1
of	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
Sodom,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
ago	1
repented,	1
sitting	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
to	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
thrust	1
down	1
to	1
hell.	1
	1
10:16	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
you	1
heareth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
you	1
despiseth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
me	1
despiseth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventy	1
returned	1
again	1
with	1
joy,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
even	1
the	1
devils	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
us	1
through	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
beheld	1
Satan	1
as	1
lightning	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:19	1
Behold,	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
power	1
to	1
tread	1
on	1
serpents	1
and	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
enemy:	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
hurt	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
in	1
this	1
rejoice	1
not,	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
rather	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
your	1
names	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:21	1
In	1
that	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes:	1
even	1
so,	1
Father;	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
10:22	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
who	1
the	1
Son	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
who	1
the	1
Father	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
privately,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
which	1
see	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
see:	1
10:24	1
For	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
kings	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
10:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
lawyer	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
tempted	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:26	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
how	1
readest	1
thou?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind;	1
and	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
answered	1
right:	1
this	1
do,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live.	1
	1
10:29	1
But	1
he,	1
willing	1
to	1
justify	1
himself,	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
neighbour?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Jericho,	1
and	1
fell	1
among	1
thieves,	1
which	1
stripped	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him,	1
and	1
departed,	1
leaving	1
him	1
half	1
dead.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
by	1
chance	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
that	1
way:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
likewise	1
a	1
Levite,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
Samaritan,	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
came	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him,	1
10:34	1
And	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
his	1
wounds,	1
pouring	1
in	1
oil	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
beast,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
inn,	1
and	1
took	1
care	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
he	1
departed,	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
two	1
pence,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
care	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
spendest	1
more,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
thee.	1
	1
10:36	1
Which	1
now	1
of	1
these	1
three,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
was	1
neighbour	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
fell	1
among	1
the	1
thieves?	1
	1
10:37	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
shewed	1
mercy	1
on	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
likewise.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village:	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Martha	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sister	1
called	1
Mary,	1
which	1
also	1
sat	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
10:40	1
But	1
Martha	1
was	1
cumbered	1
about	1
much	1
serving,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
hath	1
left	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
alone?	1
	1
bid	1
her	1
therefore	1
that	1
she	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Martha,	1
Martha,	1
thou	1
art	1
careful	1
and	1
troubled	1
about	1
many	1
things:	1
10:42	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
needful:	1
and	1
Mary	1
hath	1
chosen	1
that	1
good	1
part,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
praying	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place,	1
when	1
he	1
ceased,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
pray,	1
as	1
John	1
also	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
pray,	1
say,	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come.	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
in	1
heaven,	1
so	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
Give	1
us	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins;	1
for	1
we	1
also	1
forgive	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
indebted	1
to	1
us.	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation;	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
lend	1
me	1
three	1
loaves;	1
11:6	1
For	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
in	1
his	1
journey	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
him?	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
he	1
from	1
within	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say,	1
Trouble	1
me	1
not:	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
now	1
shut,	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
bed;	1
I	1
cannot	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
11:8	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Though	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
friend,	1
yet	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
importunity	1
he	1
will	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
needeth.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
11:11	1
If	1
a	1
son	1
shall	1
ask	1
bread	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
father,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
for	1
a	1
fish	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
11:12	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
ask	1
an	1
egg,	1
will	1
he	1
offer	1
him	1
a	1
scorpion?	1
	1
11:13	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
give	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
casting	1
out	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dumb.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
wondered.	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
others,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
sought	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:17	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
a	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
a	1
house	1
falleth.	1
	1
11:18	1
If	1
Satan	1
also	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
himself,	1
how	1
shall	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
because	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
sons	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
11:21	1
When	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
armed	1
keepeth	1
his	1
palace,	1
his	1
goods	1
are	1
in	1
peace:	1
11:22	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
stronger	1
than	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
overcome	1
him,	1
he	1
taketh	1
from	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
armour	1
wherein	1
he	1
trusted,	1
and	1
divideth	1
his	1
spoils.	1
	1
11:23	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth.	1
	1
11:24	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest;	1
and	1
finding	1
none,	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
house	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
swept	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
11:26	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
to	1
him	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself;	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things,	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
womb	1
that	1
bare	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sucked.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Yea	1
rather,	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
thick	1
together,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
generation:	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
Jonas	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
Ninevites,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
condemn	1
them:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
utmost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:32	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineve	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:33	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
putteth	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place,	1
neither	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
come	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
11:34	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
therefore	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
light;	1
but	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
evil,	1
thy	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:35	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
not	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:36	1
If	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
therefore	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
having	1
no	1
part	1
dark,	1
the	1
whole	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
bright	1
shining	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
doth	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spake,	1
a	1
certain	1
Pharisee	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
first	1
washed	1
before	1
dinner.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
do	1
ye	1
Pharisees	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
the	1
platter;	1
but	1
your	1
inward	1
part	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
ravening	1
and	1
wickedness.	1
	1
11:40	1
Ye	1
fools,	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
make	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
also?	1
	1
11:41	1
But	1
rather	1
give	1
alms	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
clean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:42	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
tithe	1
mint	1
and	1
rue	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
herbs,	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
judgment	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
11:43	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets.	1
	1
11:44	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
as	1
graves	1
which	1
appear	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
walk	1
over	1
them	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lawyers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
thus	1
saying	1
thou	1
reproachest	1
us	1
also.	1
	1
11:46	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
also,	1
ye	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
lade	1
men	1
with	1
burdens	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
burdens	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
fingers.	1
	1
11:47	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you!	1
for	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers	1
killed	1
them.	1
	1
11:48	1
Truly	1
ye	1
bear	1
witness	1
that	1
ye	1
allow	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
fathers:	1
for	1
they	1
indeed	1
killed	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
build	1
their	1
sepulchres.	1
	1
11:49	1
Therefore	1
also	1
said	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
them	1
prophets	1
and	1
apostles,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
slay	1
and	1
persecute:	1
11:50	1
That	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
was	1
shed	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
may	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation;	1
11:51	1
From	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
which	1
perished	1
between	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
temple:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:52	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
ye	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
entering	1
in	1
ye	1
hindered.	1
	1
11:53	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
11:54	1
Laying	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
seeking	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
an	1
innumerable	1
multitude	1
of	1
people,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
trode	1
one	1
upon	1
another,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
Beware	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
is	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
12:2	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
neither	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
darkness	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
light;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
ear	1
in	1
closets	1
shall	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
friends,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
do.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
forewarn	1
you	1
whom	1
ye	1
shall	1
fear:	1
Fear	1
him,	1
which	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
killed	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
cast	1
into	1
hell;	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Fear	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
Are	1
not	1
five	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
two	1
farthings,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
forgotten	1
before	1
God?	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
Fear	1
not	1
therefore:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
12:8	1
Also	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
also	1
confess	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God:	1
12:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
me	1
before	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
denied	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
blasphemeth	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
bring	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
unto	1
magistrates,	1
and	1
powers,	1
take	1
ye	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
say:	1
12:12	1
For	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
speak	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
divide	1
the	1
inheritance	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
who	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
judge	1
or	1
a	1
divider	1
over	1
you?	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
covetousness:	1
for	1
a	1
man's	1
life	1
consisteth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possesseth.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
ground	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man	1
brought	1
forth	1
plentifully:	1
12:17	1
And	1
he	1
thought	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
room	1
where	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
fruits?	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
will	1
I	1
do:	1
I	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
my	1
barns,	1
and	1
build	1
greater;	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
fruits	1
and	1
my	1
goods.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
soul,	1
Soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
much	1
goods	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
many	1
years;	1
take	1
thine	1
ease,	1
eat,	1
drink,	1
and	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
this	1
night	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
thee:	1
then	1
whose	1
shall	1
those	1
things	1
be,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
provided?	1
	1
12:21	1
So	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
layeth	1
up	1
treasure	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
rich	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat;	1
neither	1
for	1
the	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
	1
12:23	1
The	1
life	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
raiment.	1
	1
12:24	1
Consider	1
the	1
ravens:	1
for	1
they	1
neither	1
sow	1
nor	1
reap;	1
which	1
neither	1
have	1
storehouse	1
nor	1
barn;	1
and	1
God	1
feedeth	1
them:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
are	1
ye	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
fowls?	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
you	1
with	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
stature	1
one	1
cubit?	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
least,	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
rest?	1
	1
12:27	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
how	1
they	1
grow:	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
they	1
spin	1
not;	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
12:28	1
If	1
then	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
will	1
he	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
seek	1
not	1
ye	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
doubtful	1
mind.	1
	1
12:30	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seek	1
after:	1
and	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
rather	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:32	1
Fear	1
not,	1
little	1
flock;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
Father's	1
good	1
pleasure	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
12:33	1
Sell	1
that	1
ye	1
have,	1
and	1
give	1
alms;	1
provide	1
yourselves	1
bags	1
which	1
wax	1
not	1
old,	1
a	1
treasure	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
that	1
faileth	1
not,	1
where	1
no	1
thief	1
approacheth,	1
neither	1
moth	1
corrupteth.	1
	1
12:34	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
12:35	1
Let	1
your	1
loins	1
be	1
girded	1
about,	1
and	1
your	1
lights	1
burning;	1
12:36	1
And	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
like	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
lord,	1
when	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
wedding;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
and	1
knocketh,	1
they	1
may	1
open	1
unto	1
him	1
immediately.	1
	1
12:37	1
Blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants,	1
whom	1
the	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
watching:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
gird	1
himself,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
serve	1
them.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
watch,	1
or	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
watch,	1
and	1
find	1
them	1
so,	1
blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
this	1
know,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
hour	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
through.	1
	1
12:40	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
ready	1
also:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
ye	1
think	1
not.	1
	1
12:41	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
speakest	1
thou	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
us,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
all?	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
that	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
steward,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
shall	1
make	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
12:43	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
12:44	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
12:45	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
servant	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
and	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
menservants	1
and	1
maidens,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
drunken;	1
12:46	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
in	1
sunder,	1
and	1
will	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
that	1
servant,	1
which	1
knew	1
his	1
lord's	1
will,	1
and	1
prepared	1
not	1
himself,	1
neither	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
many	1
stripes.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
knew	1
not,	1
and	1
did	1
commit	1
things	1
worthy	1
of	1
stripes,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
few	1
stripes.	1
For	1
unto	1
whomsoever	1
much	1
is	1
given,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
required:	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
men	1
have	1
committed	1
much,	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
will	1
ask	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
12:49	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
I,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
already	1
kindled?	1
	1
12:50	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
baptism	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with;	1
and	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
straitened	1
till	1
it	1
be	1
accomplished!	1
	1
12:51	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
give	1
peace	1
on	1
earth?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
rather	1
division:	1
12:52	1
For	1
from	1
henceforth	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
five	1
in	1
one	1
house	1
divided,	1
three	1
against	1
two,	1
and	1
two	1
against	1
three.	1
	1
12:53	1
The	1
father	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
the	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
against	1
the	1
father;	1
the	1
mother	1
against	1
the	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
the	1
mother;	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
12:54	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
When	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
cloud	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
west,	1
straightway	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
shower;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
12:55	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blow,	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
heat;	1
and	1
it	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
12:56	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
discern	1
this	1
time?	1
	1
12:57	1
Yea,	1
and	1
why	1
even	1
of	1
yourselves	1
judge	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
right?	1
	1
12:58	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
to	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
give	1
diligence	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
him;	1
lest	1
he	1
hale	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
cast	1
thee	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
12:59	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
depart	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
mite.	1
	1
13:1	1
There	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
some	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
whose	1
blood	1
Pilate	1
had	1
mingled	1
with	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
these	1
Galilaeans	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
because	1
they	1
suffered	1
such	1
things?	1
	1
13:3	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:4	1
Or	1
those	1
eighteen,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
tower	1
in	1
Siloam	1
fell,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:6	1
He	1
spake	1
also	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
planted	1
in	1
his	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
sought	1
fruit	1
thereon,	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
dresser	1
of	1
his	1
vineyard,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
come	1
seeking	1
fruit	1
on	1
this	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
find	1
none:	1
cut	1
it	1
down;	1
why	1
cumbereth	1
it	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
let	1
it	1
alone	1
this	1
year	1
also,	1
till	1
I	1
shall	1
dig	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
dung	1
it:	1
13:9	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
bear	1
fruit,	1
well:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
it	1
down.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
infirmity	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
bowed	1
together,	1
and	1
could	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lift	1
up	1
herself.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
thou	1
art	1
loosed	1
from	1
thine	1
infirmity.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
was	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
answered	1
with	1
indignation,	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
healed	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
There	1
are	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
work:	1
in	1
them	1
therefore	1
come	1
and	1
be	1
healed,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
13:15	1
The	1
Lord	1
then	1
answered	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
doth	1
not	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
loose	1
his	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
ass	1
from	1
the	1
stall,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
watering?	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
ought	1
not	1
this	1
woman,	1
being	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
whom	1
Satan	1
hath	1
bound,	1
lo,	1
these	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
be	1
loosed	1
from	1
this	1
bond	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
all	1
his	1
adversaries	1
were	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
glorious	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
13:18	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Unto	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
like?	1
and	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
resemble	1
it?	1
	1
13:19	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
his	1
garden;	1
and	1
it	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
a	1
great	1
tree;	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
13:21	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching,	1
and	1
journeying	1
toward	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:23	1
Then	1
said	1
one	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
are	1
there	1
few	1
that	1
be	1
saved?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
13:24	1
Strive	1
to	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
many,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able.	1
	1
13:25	1
When	1
once	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
risen	1
up,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
stand	1
without,	1
and	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
unto	1
us;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are:	1
13:26	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk	1
in	1
thy	1
presence,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
in	1
our	1
streets.	1
	1
13:27	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are;	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
13:28	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
you	1
yourselves	1
thrust	1
out.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
are	1
last	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
first	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
last.	1
	1
13:31	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
came	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
depart	1
hence:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
and	1
tell	1
that	1
fox,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
cures	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
perfected.	1
	1
13:33	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
must	1
walk	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following:	1
for	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
perish	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:34	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee;	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
doth	1
gather	1
her	1
brood	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
13:35	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate:	1
and	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
Pharisees	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
	1
14:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
before	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
dropsy.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
lawyers	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go;	1
14:5	1
And	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
ass	1
or	1
an	1
ox	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
pit,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
straightway	1
pull	1
him	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
14:6	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
parable	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
bidden,	1
when	1
he	1
marked	1
how	1
they	1
chose	1
out	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms;	1
saying	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:8	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
wedding,	1
sit	1
not	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
room;	1
lest	1
a	1
more	1
honourable	1
man	1
than	1
thou	1
be	1
bidden	1
of	1
him;	1
14:9	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
this	1
man	1
place;	1
and	1
thou	1
begin	1
with	1
shame	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
lowest	1
room.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden,	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
room;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
cometh,	1
he	1
may	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Friend,	1
go	1
up	1
higher:	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
whosoever	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
14:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
also	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bade	1
him,	1
When	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
dinner	1
or	1
a	1
supper,	1
call	1
not	1
thy	1
friends,	1
nor	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
neither	1
thy	1
kinsmen,	1
nor	1
thy	1
rich	1
neighbours;	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
bid	1
thee	1
again,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
be	1
made	1
thee.	1
	1
14:13	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
feast,	1
call	1
the	1
poor,	1
the	1
maimed,	1
the	1
lame,	1
the	1
blind:	1
14:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blessed;	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
recompense	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
recompensed	1
at	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:16	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
him,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
supper,	1
and	1
bade	1
many:	1
14:17	1
And	1
sent	1
his	1
servant	1
at	1
supper	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden,	1
Come;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
now	1
ready.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
consent	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
excuse.	1
The	1
first	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
it:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
five	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prove	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
14:21	1
So	1
that	1
servant	1
came,	1
and	1
shewed	1
his	1
lord	1
these	1
things.	1
Then	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
being	1
angry	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
lanes	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
hither	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
maimed,	1
and	1
the	1
halt,	1
and	1
the	1
blind.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
room.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways	1
and	1
hedges,	1
and	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
that	1
my	1
house	1
may	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
14:24	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
shall	1
taste	1
of	1
my	1
supper.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
great	1
multitudes	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
14:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
hate	1
not	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
yea,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
also,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:28	1
For	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
intending	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
tower,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
counteth	1
the	1
cost,	1
whether	1
he	1
have	1
sufficient	1
to	1
finish	1
it?	1
14:29	1
Lest	1
haply,	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish	1
it,	1
all	1
that	1
behold	1
it	1
begin	1
to	1
mock	1
him,	1
14:30	1
Saying,	1
This	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish.	1
	1
14:31	1
Or	1
what	1
king,	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
another	1
king,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
consulteth	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
twenty	1
thousand?	1
	1
14:32	1
Or	1
else,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
an	1
ambassage,	1
and	1
desireth	1
conditions	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
14:33	1
So	1
likewise,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
forsaketh	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:34	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
seasoned?	1
	1
14:35	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
dunghill;	1
but	1
men	1
cast	1
it	1
out.	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
receiveth	1
sinners,	1
and	1
eateth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
15:4	1
What	1
man	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
if	1
he	1
lose	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
doth	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
go	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lost,	1
until	1
he	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
home,	1
he	1
calleth	1
together	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
neighbours,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
my	1
sheep	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
15:7	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
likewise	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
heaven	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth,	1
more	1
than	1
over	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
just	1
persons,	1
which	1
need	1
no	1
repentance.	1
	1
15:8	1
Either	1
what	1
woman	1
having	1
ten	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
if	1
she	1
lose	1
one	1
piece,	1
doth	1
not	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
sweep	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
seek	1
diligently	1
till	1
she	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
she	1
calleth	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
her	1
neighbours	1
together,	1
saying,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
piece	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
lost.	1
	1
15:10	1
Likewise,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
there	1
is	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons:	1
15:12	1
And	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Father,	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
goods	1
that	1
falleth	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
living.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
gathered	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
and	1
there	1
wasted	1
his	1
substance	1
with	1
riotous	1
living.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
all,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
mighty	1
famine	1
in	1
that	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
want.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
joined	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
that	1
country;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
fields	1
to	1
feed	1
swine.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
filled	1
his	1
belly	1
with	1
the	1
husks	1
that	1
the	1
swine	1
did	1
eat:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
many	1
hired	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
have	1
bread	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare,	1
and	1
I	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger!	1
15:18	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
before	1
thee,	1
15:19	1
And	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son:	1
make	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
hired	1
servants.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
his	1
father	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
compassion,	1
and	1
ran,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
15:22	1
But	1
the	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
best	1
robe,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
shoes	1
on	1
his	1
feet:	1
15:23	1
And	1
bring	1
hither	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
and	1
kill	1
it;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
eat,	1
and	1
be	1
merry:	1
15:24	1
For	1
this	1
my	1
son	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
he	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
15:25	1
Now	1
his	1
elder	1
son	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
heard	1
musick	1
and	1
dancing.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
meant.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
thy	1
father	1
hath	1
killed	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
received	1
him	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
in:	1
therefore	1
came	1
his	1
father	1
out,	1
and	1
intreated	1
him.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Lo,	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
do	1
I	1
serve	1
thee,	1
neither	1
transgressed	1
I	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thy	1
commandment:	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
never	1
gavest	1
me	1
a	1
kid,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
merry	1
with	1
my	1
friends:	1
15:30	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
thy	1
son	1
was	1
come,	1
which	1
hath	1
devoured	1
thy	1
living	1
with	1
harlots,	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
thou	1
art	1
ever	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
15:32	1
It	1
was	1
meet	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
be	1
glad:	1
for	1
this	1
thy	1
brother	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
and	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
steward;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
accused	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wasted	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
hear	1
this	1
of	1
thee?	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
thy	1
stewardship;	1
for	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
steward.	1
	1
16:3	1
Then	1
the	1
steward	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
for	1
my	1
lord	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
stewardship:	1
I	1
cannot	1
dig;	1
to	1
beg	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed.	1
	1
16:4	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stewardship,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
their	1
houses.	1
	1
16:5	1
So	1
he	1
called	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
lord's	1
debtors	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
first,	1
How	1
much	1
owest	1
thou	1
unto	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
oil.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
quickly,	1
and	1
write	1
fifty.	1
	1
16:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
another,	1
And	1
how	1
much	1
owest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
write	1
fourscore.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
commended	1
the	1
unjust	1
steward,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
wisely:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
generation	1
wiser	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mammon	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
fail,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
you	1
into	1
everlasting	1
habitations.	1
	1
16:10	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
least	1
is	1
faithful	1
also	1
in	1
much:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
unjust	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
is	1
unjust	1
also	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
16:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
mammon,	1
who	1
will	1
commit	1
to	1
your	1
trust	1
the	1
true	1
riches?	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
another	1
man's,	1
who	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
16:13	1
No	1
servant	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also,	1
who	1
were	1
covetous,	1
heard	1
all	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
they	1
derided	1
him.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
justify	1
yourselves	1
before	1
men;	1
but	1
God	1
knoweth	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
abomination	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:16	1
The	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
were	1
until	1
John:	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
preached,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
presseth	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
pass,	1
than	1
one	1
tittle	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
16:18	1
Whosoever	1
putteth	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marrieth	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
marrieth	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
16:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
fared	1
sumptuously	1
every	1
day:	1
16:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
beggar	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
which	1
was	1
laid	1
at	1
his	1
gate,	1
full	1
of	1
sores,	1
16:21	1
And	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
with	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
rich	1
man's	1
table:	1
moreover	1
the	1
dogs	1
came	1
and	1
licked	1
his	1
sores.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
beggar	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
angels	1
into	1
Abraham's	1
bosom:	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
also	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried;	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
hell	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
being	1
in	1
torments,	1
and	1
seeth	1
Abraham	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
Lazarus	1
in	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
Father	1
Abraham,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
send	1
Lazarus,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
dip	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
cool	1
my	1
tongue;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
tormented	1
in	1
this	1
flame.	1
	1
16:25	1
But	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
Son,	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
lifetime	1
receivedst	1
thy	1
good	1
things,	1
and	1
likewise	1
Lazarus	1
evil	1
things:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
comforted,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
tormented.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
gulf	1
fixed:	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
from	1
hence	1
to	1
you	1
cannot;	1
neither	1
can	1
they	1
pass	1
to	1
us,	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
16:27	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
therefore,	1
father,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
16:28	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
five	1
brethren;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
testify	1
unto	1
them,	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
place	1
of	1
torment.	1
	1
16:29	1
Abraham	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
let	1
them	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
father	1
Abraham:	1
but	1
if	1
one	1
went	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
will	1
repent.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
they	1
hear	1
not	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
neither	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
though	1
one	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:1	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
but	1
that	1
offences	1
will	1
come:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
him,	1
through	1
whom	1
they	1
come!	1
	1
17:2	1
It	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
17:3	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
If	1
thy	1
brother	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
rebuke	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
repent,	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
I	1
repent;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Increase	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
might	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
sycamine	1
tree,	1
Be	1
thou	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
root,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
obey	1
you.	1
	1
17:7	1
But	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
servant	1
plowing	1
or	1
feeding	1
cattle,	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
field,	1
Go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat?	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
rather	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Make	1
ready	1
wherewith	1
I	1
may	1
sup,	1
and	1
gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
serve	1
me,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunken;	1
and	1
afterward	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
17:9	1
Doth	1
he	1
thank	1
that	1
servant	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
commanded	1
him?	1
I	1
trow	1
not.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
commanded	1
you,	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
servants:	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Galilee.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
ten	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
lepers,	1
which	1
stood	1
afar	1
off:	1
17:13	1
And	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
shew	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
priests.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
were	1
cleansed.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
healed,	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
glorified	1
God,	1
17:16	1
And	1
fell	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
giving	1
him	1
thanks:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Samaritan.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
Were	1
there	1
not	1
ten	1
cleansed?	1
but	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
nine?	1
	1
17:18	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
found	1
that	1
returned	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
God,	1
save	1
this	1
stranger.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
when	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come,	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
not	1
with	1
observation:	1
17:21	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
say,	1
Lo	1
here!	1
or,	1
lo	1
there!	1
for,	1
behold,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
within	1
you.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
The	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
See	1
here;	1
or,	1
see	1
there:	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
them,	1
nor	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
17:24	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning,	1
that	1
lighteneth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
under	1
heaven,	1
shineth	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
under	1
heaven;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
day.	1
	1
17:25	1
But	1
first	1
must	1
he	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
17:27	1
They	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
married	1
wives,	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:28	1
Likewise	1
also	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Lot;	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
bought,	1
they	1
sold,	1
they	1
planted,	1
they	1
builded;	1
17:29	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Lot	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Sodom	1
it	1
rained	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:30	1
Even	1
thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
revealed.	1
	1
17:31	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
he	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
his	1
stuff	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
let	1
him	1
likewise	1
not	1
return	1
back.	1
	1
17:32	1
Remember	1
Lot's	1
wife.	1
	1
17:33	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
preserve	1
it.	1
	1
17:34	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
in	1
that	1
night	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
bed;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
shall	1
be	1
left.	1
	1
17:35	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
together;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:36	1
Two	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:37	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wheresoever	1
the	1
body	1
is,	1
thither	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
end,	1
that	1
men	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
faint;	1
18:2	1
Saying,	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
a	1
judge,	1
which	1
feared	1
not	1
God,	1
neither	1
regarded	1
man:	1
18:3	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
in	1
that	1
city;	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Avenge	1
me	1
of	1
mine	1
adversary.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
Though	1
I	1
fear	1
not	1
God,	1
nor	1
regard	1
man;	1
18:5	1
Yet	1
because	1
this	1
widow	1
troubleth	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
her,	1
lest	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
coming	1
she	1
weary	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Hear	1
what	1
the	1
unjust	1
judge	1
saith.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
God	1
avenge	1
his	1
own	1
elect,	1
which	1
cry	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
unto	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
bear	1
long	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
18:8	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
avenge	1
them	1
speedily.	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
he	1
find	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
certain	1
which	1
trusted	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
righteous,	1
and	1
despised	1
others:	1
18:10	1
Two	1
men	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
pray;	1
the	1
one	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:11	1
The	1
Pharisee	1
stood	1
and	1
prayed	1
thus	1
with	1
himself,	1
God,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
men	1
are,	1
extortioners,	1
unjust,	1
adulterers,	1
or	1
even	1
as	1
this	1
publican.	1
	1
18:12	1
I	1
fast	1
twice	1
in	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
give	1
tithes	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
possess.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
publican,	1
standing	1
afar	1
off,	1
would	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
but	1
smote	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
saying,	1
God	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
18:14	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
justified	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
also	1
infants,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
touch	1
them:	1
but	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:17	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
none	1
is	1
good,	1
save	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
18:20	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
All	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up.	1
	1
18:22	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yet	1
lackest	1
thou	1
one	1
thing:	1
sell	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
distribute	1
unto	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
this,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
rich.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
18:25	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
needle's	1
eye,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
impossible	1
with	1
men	1
are	1
possible	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
parents,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God's	1
sake,	1
18:30	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
manifold	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
concerning	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished.	1
	1
18:32	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
mocked,	1
and	1
spitefully	1
entreated,	1
and	1
spitted	1
on:	1
18:33	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
neither	1
knew	1
they	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken.	1
	1
18:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
certain	1
blind	1
man	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
begging:	1
18:36	1
And	1
hearing	1
the	1
multitude	1
pass	1
by,	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
	1
18:37	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
passeth	1
by.	1
	1
18:38	1
And	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:39	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
18:41	1
Saying,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
18:42	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Receive	1
thy	1
sight:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee.	1
	1
18:43	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
glorifying	1
God:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
gave	1
praise	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Jericho.	1
	1
19:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Zacchaeus,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
among	1
the	1
publicans,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
rich.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
see	1
Jesus	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
of	1
stature.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
before,	1
and	1
climbed	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sycomore	1
tree	1
to	1
see	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Zacchaeus,	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
come	1
down;	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
I	1
must	1
abide	1
at	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
received	1
him	1
joyfully.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
all	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
be	1
guest	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
Zacchaeus	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Behold,	1
Lord,	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
goods	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
any	1
man	1
by	1
false	1
accusation,	1
I	1
restore	1
him	1
fourfold.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
salvation	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
house,	1
forsomuch	1
as	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
19:10	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
spake	1
a	1
parable,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
immediately	1
appear.	1
	1
19:12	1
He	1
said	1
therefore,	1
A	1
certain	1
nobleman	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
to	1
receive	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
ten	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
ten	1
pounds,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Occupy	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
his	1
citizens	1
hated	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
after	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
returned,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
then	1
he	1
commanded	1
these	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
money,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
gained	1
by	1
trading.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
first,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
thou	1
good	1
servant:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
little,	1
have	1
thou	1
authority	1
over	1
ten	1
cities.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
five	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
likewise	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
thou	1
also	1
over	1
five	1
cities.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
another	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
is	1
thy	1
pound,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
napkin:	1
19:21	1
For	1
I	1
feared	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
austere	1
man:	1
thou	1
takest	1
up	1
that	1
thou	1
layedst	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reapest	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
sow.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
mouth	1
will	1
I	1
judge	1
thee,	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant.	1
Thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
austere	1
man,	1
taking	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
laid	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reaping	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sow:	1
19:23	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
gavest	1
not	1
thou	1
my	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
bank,	1
that	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
required	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury?	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Take	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
pound,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:25	1
(And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
he	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.)	1
	1
19:26	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
19:27	1
But	1
those	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
reign	1
over	1
them,	1
bring	1
hither,	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
went	1
before,	1
ascending	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
19:30	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
at	1
your	1
entering	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
yet	1
never	1
man	1
sat:	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
ask	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
loose	1
him?	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:32	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt,	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
loose	1
ye	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
upon	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
Jesus	1
thereon.	1
	1
19:36	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
they	1
spread	1
their	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh,	1
even	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
and	1
praise	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen;	1
19:38	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
peace	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
multitude	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
rebuke	1
thy	1
disciples.	1
	1
19:40	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
if	1
these	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
the	1
stones	1
would	1
immediately	1
cry	1
out.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
wept	1
over	1
it,	1
19:42	1
Saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
hadst	1
known,	1
even	1
thou,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
day,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
belong	1
unto	1
thy	1
peace!	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:43	1
For	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
trench	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
compass	1
thee	1
round,	1
and	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
19:44	1
And	1
shall	1
lay	1
thee	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
within	1
thee;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
in	1
thee	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another;	1
because	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
visitation.	1
	1
19:45	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
therein,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
bought;	1
19:46	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
19:47	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
him,	1
19:48	1
And	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
days,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
20:2	1
And	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
and	1
answer	1
me:	1
20:4	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
believed	1
ye	1
him	1
not?	1
	1
20:6	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
stone	1
us:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
forth	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard:	1
but	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another	1
servant:	1
and	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
shamefully,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
third:	1
and	1
they	1
wounded	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
20:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
beloved	1
son:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
reverence	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir:	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
inheritance	1
may	1
be	1
ours.	1
	1
20:15	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
killed	1
him.	1
What	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
20:16	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
these	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
to	1
others.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner?	1
	1
20:18	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
that	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
parable	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
spies,	1
which	1
should	1
feign	1
themselves	1
just	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
that	1
so	1
they	1
might	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
sayest	1
and	1
teachest	1
rightly,	1
neither	1
acceptest	1
thou	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
any,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
truly:	1
20:22	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
no?	1
	1
20:23	1
But	1
he	1
perceived	1
their	1
craftiness,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
	1
20:24	1
Shew	1
me	1
a	1
penny.	1
Whose	1
image	1
and	1
superscription	1
hath	1
it?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
God's.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
before	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
his	1
answer,	1
and	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
20:28	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
having	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
without	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
20:29	1
There	1
were	1
therefore	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
children.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
childless.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
took	1
her;	1
and	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
the	1
seven	1
also:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
no	1
children,	1
and	1
died.	1
	1
20:32	1
Last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
20:33	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
she?	1
for	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
marry,	1
and	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:35	1
But	1
they	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:36	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
die	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
equal	1
unto	1
the	1
angels;	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
being	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:37	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
even	1
Moses	1
shewed	1
at	1
the	1
bush,	1
when	1
he	1
calleth	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
20:38	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
for	1
all	1
live	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
20:39	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
answering	1
said,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
say	1
they	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
David's	1
son?	1
20:42	1
And	1
David	1
himself	1
saith	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
20:43	1
Till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
20:44	1
David	1
therefore	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
20:45	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
20:46	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
desire	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
long	1
robes,	1
and	1
love	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
the	1
highest	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts;	1
20:47	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
shew	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
casting	1
their	1
gifts	1
into	1
the	1
treasury.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
also	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow	1
casting	1
in	1
thither	1
two	1
mites.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
21:4	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
of	1
their	1
abundance	1
cast	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
penury	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
that	1
she	1
had.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
as	1
some	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
adorned	1
with	1
goodly	1
stones	1
and	1
gifts,	1
he	1
said,	1
21:6	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
but	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
	1
and	1
what	1
sign	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass?	1
21:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
for	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
draweth	1
near:	1
go	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
21:9	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
commotions,	1
be	1
not	1
terrified:	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
first	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
by	1
and	1
by.	1
	1
21:10	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
21:11	1
And	1
great	1
earthquakes	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences;	1
and	1
fearful	1
sights	1
and	1
great	1
signs	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
21:12	1
But	1
before	1
all	1
these,	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
delivering	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
into	1
prisons,	1
being	1
brought	1
before	1
kings	1
and	1
rulers	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
testimony.	1
	1
21:14	1
Settle	1
it	1
therefore	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
not	1
to	1
meditate	1
before	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer:	1
21:15	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
mouth	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
all	1
your	1
adversaries	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
gainsay	1
nor	1
resist.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
both	1
by	1
parents,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
kinsfolks,	1
and	1
friends;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
they	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:18	1
But	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
perish.	1
	1
21:19	1
In	1
your	1
patience	1
possess	1
ye	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Jerusalem	1
compassed	1
with	1
armies,	1
then	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
desolation	1
thereof	1
is	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:21	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
depart	1
out;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
countries	1
enter	1
thereinto.	1
	1
21:22	1
For	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
vengeance,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:23	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck,	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
distress	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
wrath	1
upon	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stars;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
distress	1
of	1
nations,	1
with	1
perplexity;	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
roaring;	1
21:26	1
Men's	1
hearts	1
failing	1
them	1
for	1
fear,	1
and	1
for	1
looking	1
after	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
coming	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
begin	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
then	1
look	1
up,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads;	1
for	1
your	1
redemption	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
parable;	1
Behold	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees;	1
21:30	1
When	1
they	1
now	1
shoot	1
forth,	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
now	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:31	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:32	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:33	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
your	1
hearts	1
be	1
overcharged	1
with	1
surfeiting,	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
day	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
unawares.	1
	1
21:35	1
For	1
as	1
a	1
snare	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
21:36	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
pray	1
always,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
escape	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
21:38	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
22:1	1
Now	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Passover.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
kill	1
him;	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
22:3	1
Then	1
entered	1
Satan	1
into	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Iscariot,	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
captains,	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
covenanted	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
promised,	1
and	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
22:7	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
the	1
passover	1
must	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
prepare	1
us	1
the	1
passover,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare?	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
there	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
meet	1
you,	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water;	1
follow	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
entereth	1
in.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished:	1
there	1
make	1
ready.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
eat	1
this	1
passover	1
with	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
suffer:	1
22:16	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take	1
this,	1
and	1
divide	1
it	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
22:20	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
cup	1
after	1
supper,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
But,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
truly	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
determined:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
enquire	1
among	1
themselves,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
strife	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
accounted	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them	1
are	1
called	1
benefactors.	1
	1
22:26	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
younger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
chief,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
serve.	1
	1
22:27	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat,	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
serveth?	1
	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat?	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
among	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
serveth.	1
	1
22:28	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
temptations.	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
I	1
appoint	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
appointed	1
unto	1
me;	1
22:30	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
thrones	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Simon,	1
Simon,	1
behold,	1
Satan	1
hath	1
desired	1
to	1
have	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sift	1
you	1
as	1
wheat:	1
22:32	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
prayed	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
thy	1
faith	1
fail	1
not:	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
converted,	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
brethren.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
both	1
into	1
prison,	1
and	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Peter,	1
the	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow	1
this	1
day,	1
before	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
thrice	1
deny	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
me.	1
	1
22:35	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
without	1
purse,	1
and	1
scrip,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
lacked	1
ye	1
any	1
thing?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Nothing.	1
	1
22:36	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
now,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
purse,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
likewise	1
his	1
scrip:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
sword,	1
let	1
him	1
sell	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
buy	1
one.	1
	1
22:37	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
must	1
yet	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
me,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
reckoned	1
among	1
the	1
transgressors:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
me	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
22:38	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
swords.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
enough.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
went,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
to	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
also	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
22:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Pray	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:41	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
them	1
about	1
a	1
stone's	1
cast,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
Father,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
willing,	1
remove	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
my	1
will,	1
but	1
thine,	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:43	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
an	1
angel	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
heaven,	1
strengthening	1
him.	1
	1
22:44	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
he	1
prayed	1
more	1
earnestly:	1
and	1
his	1
sweat	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
great	1
drops	1
of	1
blood	1
falling	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
22:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
prayer,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
sleeping	1
for	1
sorrow,	1
22:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
sleep	1
ye?	1
rise	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold	1
a	1
multitude,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
	1
22:48	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Judas,	1
betrayest	1
thou	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
kiss?	1
	1
22:49	1
When	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
saw	1
what	1
would	1
follow,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
we	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
sword?	1
22:50	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
smote	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
	1
22:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
ye	1
thus	1
far.	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
22:52	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves?	1
	1
22:53	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
ye	1
stretched	1
forth	1
no	1
hands	1
against	1
me:	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
hour,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
22:54	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
house.	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
22:55	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
together,	1
Peter	1
sat	1
down	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
22:56	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
maid	1
beheld	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
earnestly	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:57	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Woman,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
22:58	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
another	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
also	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
22:59	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
one	1
hour	1
after	1
another	1
confidently	1
affirmed,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
fellow	1
also	1
was	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
22:60	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
22:61	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
turned,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
Peter.	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
22:62	1
And	1
Peter	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
22:63	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
held	1
Jesus	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him.	1
	1
22:64	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
blindfolded	1
him,	1
they	1
struck	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy,	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
22:65	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
blasphemously	1
spake	1
they	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:66	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
their	1
council,	1
saying,	1
22:67	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ?	1
tell	1
us.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe:	1
22:68	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
also	1
ask	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
me,	1
nor	1
let	1
me	1
go.	1
	1
22:69	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:70	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
all,	1
Art	1
thou	1
then	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
22:71	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witness?	1
for	1
we	1
ourselves	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
arose,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
found	1
this	1
fellow	1
perverting	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
forbidding	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
Christ	1
a	1
King.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
23:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
fierce,	1
saying,	1
He	1
stirreth	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
teaching	1
throughout	1
all	1
Jewry,	1
beginning	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
23:6	1
When	1
Pilate	1
heard	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
belonged	1
unto	1
Herod's	1
jurisdiction,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Herod,	1
who	1
himself	1
also	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
season,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
some	1
miracle	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
23:9	1
Then	1
he	1
questioned	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
many	1
words;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
nothing.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
stood	1
and	1
vehemently	1
accused	1
him.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
Herod	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
nought,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
gorgeous	1
robe,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
Pilate	1
and	1
Herod	1
were	1
made	1
friends	1
together:	1
for	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
enmity	1
between	1
themselves.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
23:14	1
Said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
man	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
perverteth	1
the	1
people:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
having	1
examined	1
him	1
before	1
you,	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man	1
touching	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
accuse	1
him:	1
23:15	1
No,	1
nor	1
yet	1
Herod:	1
for	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
release	1
him.	1
	1
23:17	1
(For	1
of	1
necessity	1
he	1
must	1
release	1
one	1
unto	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
feast.)	1
23:18	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
saying,	1
Away	1
with	1
this	1
man,	1
and	1
release	1
unto	1
us	1
Barabbas:	1
23:19	1
(Who	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
sedition	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
for	1
murder,	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.)	1
	1
23:20	1
Pilate	1
therefore,	1
willing	1
to	1
release	1
Jesus,	1
spake	1
again	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
they	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
instant	1
with	1
loud	1
voices,	1
requiring	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
prevailed.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
sentence	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
they	1
required.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
him	1
that	1
for	1
sedition	1
and	1
murder	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
desired;	1
but	1
he	1
delivered	1
Jesus	1
to	1
their	1
will.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
they	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
one	1
Simon,	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
on	1
him	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bear	1
it	1
after	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:27	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
women,	1
which	1
also	1
bewailed	1
and	1
lamented	1
him.	1
	1
23:28	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turning	1
unto	1
them	1
said,	1
Daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
weep	1
not	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
weep	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
children.	1
	1
23:29	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
barren,	1
and	1
the	1
wombs	1
that	1
never	1
bare,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
never	1
gave	1
suck.	1
	1
23:30	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Cover	1
us.	1
	1
23:31	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
tree,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
dry?	1
	1
23:32	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
two	1
other,	1
malefactors,	1
led	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Calvary,	1
there	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
malefactors,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
23:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Father,	1
forgive	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
do.	1
And	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
23:35	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
beholding.	1
And	1
the	1
rulers	1
also	1
with	1
them	1
derided	1
him,	1
saying,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
let	1
him	1
save	1
himself,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
Christ,	1
the	1
chosen	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:36	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
also	1
mocked	1
him,	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
offering	1
him	1
vinegar,	1
23:37	1
And	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
	1
23:38	1
And	1
a	1
superscription	1
also	1
was	1
written	1
over	1
him	1
in	1
letters	1
of	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin,	1
and	1
Hebrew,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
23:39	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
malefactors	1
which	1
were	1
hanged	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
Christ,	1
save	1
thyself	1
and	1
us.	1
	1
23:40	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
answering	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Dost	1
not	1
thou	1
fear	1
God,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condemnation?	1
	1
23:41	1
And	1
we	1
indeed	1
justly;	1
for	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
due	1
reward	1
of	1
our	1
deeds:	1
but	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done	1
nothing	1
amiss.	1
	1
23:42	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
remember	1
me	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
into	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
23:43	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
To	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
paradise.	1
	1
23:44	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
23:45	1
And	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
23:46	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
said,	1
Father,	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
I	1
commend	1
my	1
spirit:	1
and	1
having	1
said	1
thus,	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
23:47	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
he	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Certainly	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
righteous	1
man.	1
	1
23:48	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
that	1
sight,	1
beholding	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
done,	1
smote	1
their	1
breasts,	1
and	1
returned.	1
	1
23:49	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
followed	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
beholding	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
23:50	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
a	1
counsellor;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
just:	1
23:51	1
(The	1
same	1
had	1
not	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
counsel	1
and	1
deed	1
of	1
them;)	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:52	1
This	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:53	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
was	1
hewn	1
in	1
stone,	1
wherein	1
never	1
man	1
before	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:54	1
And	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath	1
drew	1
on.	1
	1
23:55	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
also,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
after,	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
how	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:56	1
And	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
prepared	1
spices	1
and	1
ointments;	1
and	1
rested	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
24:1	1
Now	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
bringing	1
the	1
spices	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
prepared,	1
and	1
certain	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
stone	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
they	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
perplexed	1
thereabout,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
shining	1
garments:	1
24:5	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
living	1
among	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
24:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
but	1
is	1
risen:	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
24:7	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinful	1
men,	1
and	1
be	1
crucified,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
they	1
remembered	1
his	1
words,	1
24:9	1
And	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
24:10	1
It	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Joanna,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
other	1
women	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
which	1
told	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
their	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
idle	1
tales,	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
24:12	1
Then	1
arose	1
Peter,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
and	1
stooping	1
down,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
laid	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
departed,	1
wondering	1
in	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
24:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
village	1
called	1
Emmaus,	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
about	1
threescore	1
furlongs.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
they	1
talked	1
together	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
happened.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
communed	1
together	1
and	1
reasoned,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:16	1
But	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
holden	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
communications	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
ye	1
walk,	1
and	1
are	1
sad?	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Cleopas,	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
only	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
there	1
in	1
these	1
days?	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
things?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Concerning	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
mighty	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
word	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
24:20	1
And	1
how	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
our	1
rulers	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
condemned	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
have	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
24:21	1
But	1
we	1
trusted	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
he	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
redeemed	1
Israel:	1
and	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
since	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
24:22	1
Yea,	1
and	1
certain	1
women	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
company	1
made	1
us	1
astonished,	1
which	1
were	1
early	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
24:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
not	1
his	1
body,	1
they	1
came,	1
saying,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
angels,	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
even	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
said:	1
but	1
him	1
they	1
saw	1
not.	1
	1
24:25	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
fools,	1
and	1
slow	1
of	1
heart	1
to	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
spoken:	1
24:26	1
Ought	1
not	1
Christ	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
glory?	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
beginning	1
at	1
Moses	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
he	1
expounded	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
himself.	1
	1
24:28	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
village,	1
whither	1
they	1
went:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
further.	1
	1
24:29	1
But	1
they	1
constrained	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Abide	1
with	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
toward	1
evening,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
far	1
spent.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
vanished	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Did	1
not	1
our	1
heart	1
burn	1
within	1
us,	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
opened	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
scriptures?	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
eleven	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
24:34	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
risen	1
indeed,	1
and	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
Simon.	1
	1
24:35	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
24:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
thus	1
spake,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
terrified	1
and	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
spirit.	1
	1
24:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
troubled?	1
and	1
why	1
do	1
thoughts	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
24:39	1
Behold	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
feet,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
myself:	1
handle	1
me,	1
and	1
see;	1
for	1
a	1
spirit	1
hath	1
not	1
flesh	1
and	1
bones,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
have.	1
	1
24:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
shewed	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
24:41	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
yet	1
believed	1
not	1
for	1
joy,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
here	1
any	1
meat?	1
	1
24:42	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
broiled	1
fish,	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
honeycomb.	1
	1
24:43	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
24:44	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
psalms,	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
24:45	1
Then	1
opened	1
he	1
their	1
understanding,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
understand	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
24:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
behoved	1
Christ	1
to	1
suffer,	1
and	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
24:47	1
And	1
that	1
repentance	1
and	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
beginning	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
24:48	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
24:49	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
upon	1
you:	1
but	1
tarry	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
until	1
ye	1
be	1
endued	1
with	1
power	1
from	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
24:50	1
And	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
24:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
parted	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
up	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
24:52	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
great	1
joy:	1
24:53	1
And	1
were	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
praising	1
and	1
blessing	1
God.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
God.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
same	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:3	1
All	1
things	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
without	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
made	1
that	1
was	1
made.	1
	1
1:4	1
In	1
him	1
was	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
shineth	1
in	1
darkness;	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
comprehended	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
sent	1
from	1
God,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
John.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
for	1
a	1
witness,	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
Light,	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
1:8	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Light,	1
but	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
that	1
Light.	1
	1
1:9	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
Light,	1
which	1
lighteth	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:10	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:11	1
He	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
received	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
received	1
him,	1
to	1
them	1
gave	1
he	1
power	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name:	1
1:13	1
Which	1
were	1
born,	1
not	1
of	1
blood,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
made	1
flesh,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
among	1
us,	1
(and	1
we	1
beheld	1
his	1
glory,	1
the	1
glory	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father,)	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
John	1
bare	1
witness	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
This	1
was	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spake,	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
of	1
his	1
fulness	1
have	1
all	1
we	1
received,	1
and	1
grace	1
for	1
grace.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
Moses,	1
but	1
grace	1
and	1
truth	1
came	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:18	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
John,	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
sent	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
he	1
confessed,	1
and	1
denied	1
not;	1
but	1
confessed,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
then?	1
Art	1
thou	1
Elias?	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
prophet?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
No.	1
	1
1:22	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sent	1
us.	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
thyself?	1
	1
1:23	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Make	1
straight	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
said	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
baptizest	1
thou	1
then,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
that	1
Christ,	1
nor	1
Elias,	1
neither	1
that	1
prophet?	1
	1
1:26	1
John	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
baptize	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
there	1
standeth	1
one	1
among	1
you,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not;	1
1:27	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
who	1
coming	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoe's	1
latchet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:28	1
These	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
Bethabara	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
where	1
John	1
was	1
baptizing.	1
	1
1:29	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
John	1
seeth	1
Jesus	1
coming	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:30	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
said,	1
After	1
me	1
cometh	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
Israel,	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
baptizing	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
John	1
bare	1
record,	1
saying,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending	1
from	1
heaven	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
it	1
abode	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
baptize	1
with	1
water,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Upon	1
whom	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending,	1
and	1
remaining	1
on	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
baptizeth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
bare	1
record	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:35	1
Again	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
after	1
John	1
stood,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples;	1
1:36	1
And	1
looking	1
upon	1
Jesus	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
disciples	1
heard	1
him	1
speak,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:38	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
turned,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
following,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
seek	1
ye?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
(which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Master,)	1
where	1
dwellest	1
thou?	1
	1
1:39	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
They	1
came	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
he	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
tenth	1
hour.	1
	1
1:40	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
which	1
heard	1
John	1
speak,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
was	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:41	1
He	1
first	1
findeth	1
his	1
own	1
brother	1
Simon,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
Messias,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Simon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jona:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
Cephas,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
A	1
stone.	1
	1
1:43	1
The	1
day	1
following	1
Jesus	1
would	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
findeth	1
Philip,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
1:44	1
Now	1
Philip	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Peter.	1
	1
1:45	1
Philip	1
findeth	1
Nathanael,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
of	1
whom	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
write,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Nathanael	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Can	1
there	1
any	1
good	1
thing	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
1:47	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
Nathanael	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
of	1
him,	1
Behold	1
an	1
Israelite	1
indeed,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
guile!	1
	1
1:48	1
Nathanael	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
knowest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
that	1
Philip	1
called	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee.	1
	1
1:49	1
Nathanael	1
answered	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:50	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
believest	1
thou?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
things	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
1:51	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
heaven	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending	1
upon	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
marriage	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
was	1
there:	1
2:2	1
And	1
both	1
Jesus	1
was	1
called,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
wanted	1
wine,	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
wine.	1
	1
2:4	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1
mine	1
hour	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
2:5	1
His	1
mother	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
servants,	1
Whatsoever	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
you,	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
set	1
there	1
six	1
waterpots	1
of	1
stone,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
containing	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
firkins	1
apiece.	1
	1
2:7	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fill	1
the	1
waterpots	1
with	1
water.	1
And	1
they	1
filled	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
brim.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Draw	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
bear	1
unto	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
And	1
they	1
bare	1
it.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
had	1
tasted	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
wine,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
whence	1
it	1
was:	1
(but	1
the	1
servants	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
water	1
knew;)	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
called	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
2:10	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Every	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
doth	1
set	1
forth	1
good	1
wine;	1
and	1
when	1
men	1
have	1
well	1
drunk,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
worse:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
good	1
wine	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:11	1
This	1
beginning	1
of	1
miracles	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
manifested	1
forth	1
his	1
glory;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
2:12	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
there	1
not	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
those	1
that	1
sold	1
oxen	1
and	1
sheep	1
and	1
doves,	1
and	1
the	1
changers	1
of	1
money	1
sitting:	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
scourge	1
of	1
small	1
cords,	1
he	1
drove	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
oxen;	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
changers'	1
money,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables;	1
2:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
Take	1
these	1
things	1
hence;	1
make	1
not	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
merchandise.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
hath	1
eaten	1
me	1
up.	1
	1
2:18	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
unto	1
us,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:19	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Destroy	1
this	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Forty	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
was	1
this	1
temple	1
in	1
building,	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
rear	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
three	1
days?	1
	1
2:21	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
his	1
body.	1
	1
2:22	1
When	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
the	1
scripture,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
2:23	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
passover,	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
Jesus	1
did	1
not	1
commit	1
himself	1
unto	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
men,	1
2:25	1
And	1
needed	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
testify	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
named	1
Nicodemus,	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
3:2	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
teacher	1
come	1
from	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
these	1
miracles	1
that	1
thou	1
doest,	1
except	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
again,	1
he	1
cannot	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
old?	1
can	1
he	1
enter	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
into	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
be	1
born?	1
	1
3:5	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
he	1
cannot	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:6	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
flesh;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:7	1
Marvel	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
born	1
again.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
wind	1
bloweth	1
where	1
it	1
listeth,	1
and	1
thou	1
hearest	1
the	1
sound	1
thereof,	1
but	1
canst	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
cometh,	1
and	1
whither	1
it	1
goeth:	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:9	1
Nicodemus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
3:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
master	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
3:11	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
We	1
speak	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
know,	1
and	1
testify	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen;	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
our	1
witness.	1
	1
3:12	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
earthly	1
things,	1
and	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe,	1
if	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
as	1
Moses	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
serpent	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
even	1
so	1
must	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
lifted	1
up:	1
3:15	1
That	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
God	1
sent	1
not	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
condemn	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:18	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
condemned:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
is	1
condemned	1
already,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
condemnation,	1
that	1
light	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
men	1
loved	1
darkness	1
rather	1
than	1
light,	1
because	1
their	1
deeds	1
were	1
evil.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hateth	1
the	1
light,	1
neither	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
his	1
deeds	1
should	1
be	1
reproved.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
truth	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
his	1
deeds	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
wrought	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
tarried	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
John	1
also	1
was	1
baptizing	1
in	1
Aenon	1
near	1
to	1
Salim,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
water	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:24	1
For	1
John	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
3:25	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
question	1
between	1
some	1
of	1
John's	1
disciples	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
about	1
purifying.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
barest	1
witness,	1
behold,	1
the	1
same	1
baptizeth,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
3:27	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
can	1
receive	1
nothing,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:28	1
Ye	1
yourselves	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
bride	1
is	1
the	1
bridegroom:	1
but	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
which	1
standeth	1
and	1
heareth	1
him,	1
rejoiceth	1
greatly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom's	1
voice:	1
this	1
my	1
joy	1
therefore	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:30	1
He	1
must	1
increase,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
decrease.	1
	1
3:31	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
above	1
all:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
earthly,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
heaven	1
is	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
and	1
heard,	1
that	1
he	1
testifieth;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
receiveth	1
his	1
testimony.	1
	1
3:33	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
received	1
his	1
testimony	1
hath	1
set	1
to	1
his	1
seal	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
3:34	1
For	1
he	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
speaketh	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
giveth	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
measure	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:35	1
The	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:36	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
life;	1
but	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
When	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
made	1
and	1
baptized	1
more	1
disciples	1
than	1
John,	1
4:2	1
(Though	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
baptized	1
not,	1
but	1
his	1
disciples,)	1
4:3	1
He	1
left	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
he	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
through	1
Samaria.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Sychar,	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
ground	1
that	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Joseph.	1
	1
4:6	1
Now	1
Jacob's	1
well	1
was	1
there.	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
being	1
wearied	1
with	1
his	1
journey,	1
sat	1
thus	1
on	1
the	1
well:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour.	1
	1
4:7	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
to	1
draw	1
water:	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
4:8	1
(For	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
buy	1
meat.)	1
	1
4:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
askest	1
drink	1
of	1
me,	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria?	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
no	1
dealings	1
with	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
4:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
knewest	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink;	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
have	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
draw	1
with,	1
and	1
the	1
well	1
is	1
deep:	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
living	1
water?	1
4:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
gave	1
us	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
drank	1
thereof	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
his	1
cattle?	1
	1
4:13	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
this	1
water	1
shall	1
thirst	1
again:	1
4:14	1
But	1
whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst;	1
but	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
springing	1
up	1
into	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
4:15	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
water,	1
that	1
I	1
thirst	1
not,	1
neither	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
draw.	1
	1
4:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go,	1
call	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
4:17	1
The	1
woman	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband.	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband:	1
4:18	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
five	1
husbands;	1
and	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
now	1
hast	1
is	1
not	1
thy	1
husband:	1
in	1
that	1
saidst	1
thou	1
truly.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
4:20	1
Our	1
fathers	1
worshipped	1
in	1
this	1
mountain;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
4:21	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
mountain,	1
nor	1
yet	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
worship	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
4:22	1
Ye	1
worship	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what:	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
worship:	1
for	1
salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
true	1
worshippers	1
shall	1
worship	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth:	1
for	1
the	1
Father	1
seeketh	1
such	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
4:24	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
worship	1
him	1
must	1
worship	1
him	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
4:25	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Messias	1
cometh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ:	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
4:26	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
that	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
upon	1
this	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
woman:	1
yet	1
no	1
man	1
said,	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
or,	1
Why	1
talkest	1
thou	1
with	1
her?	1
	1
4:28	1
The	1
woman	1
then	1
left	1
her	1
waterpot,	1
and	1
went	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
4:29	1
Come,	1
see	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
Christ?	1
	1
4:30	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:31	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
his	1
disciples	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
eat.	1
	1
4:32	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
meat	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
of.	1
	1
4:33	1
Therefore	1
said	1
the	1
disciples	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Hath	1
any	1
man	1
brought	1
him	1
ought	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
4:34	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
meat	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
4:35	1
Say	1
not	1
ye,	1
There	1
are	1
yet	1
four	1
months,	1
and	1
then	1
cometh	1
harvest?	1
behold,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
fields;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
white	1
already	1
to	1
harvest.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
receiveth	1
wages,	1
and	1
gathereth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal:	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
may	1
rejoice	1
together.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
herein	1
is	1
that	1
saying	1
true,	1
One	1
soweth,	1
and	1
another	1
reapeth.	1
	1
4:38	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
reap	1
that	1
whereon	1
ye	1
bestowed	1
no	1
labour:	1
other	1
men	1
laboured,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
labours.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
which	1
testified,	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did.	1
	1
4:40	1
So	1
when	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
tarry	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
he	1
abode	1
there	1
two	1
days.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
believed	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
word;	1
4:42	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Now	1
we	1
believe,	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
saying:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:43	1
Now	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:44	1
For	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
testified,	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
hath	1
no	1
honour	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:45	1
Then	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
the	1
Galilaeans	1
received	1
him,	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
for	1
they	1
also	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
4:46	1
So	1
Jesus	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
where	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
water	1
wine.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
nobleman,	1
whose	1
son	1
was	1
sick	1
at	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
4:47	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
4:48	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Except	1
ye	1
see	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
4:49	1
The	1
nobleman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
come	1
down	1
ere	1
my	1
child	1
die.	1
	1
4:50	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
believed	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
4:51	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
down,	1
his	1
servants	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:52	1
Then	1
enquired	1
he	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
amend.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
seventh	1
hour	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
him.	1
	1
4:53	1
So	1
the	1
father	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth:	1
and	1
himself	1
believed,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
house.	1
	1
4:54	1
This	1
is	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
After	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
5:2	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
sheep	1
market	1
a	1
pool,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Bethesda,	1
having	1
five	1
porches.	1
	1
5:3	1
In	1
these	1
lay	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
impotent	1
folk,	1
of	1
blind,	1
halt,	1
withered,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
moving	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
an	1
angel	1
went	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
season	1
into	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
water:	1
whosoever	1
then	1
first	1
after	1
the	1
troubling	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
stepped	1
in	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
disease	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
there,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
infirmity	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
5:6	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
him	1
lie,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
made	1
whole?	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
impotent	1
man	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man,	1
when	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
troubled,	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
pool:	1
but	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
coming,	1
another	1
steppeth	1
down	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
made	1
whole,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
walked:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
cured,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
carry	1
thy	1
bed.	1
	1
5:11	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
whole,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:12	1
Then	1
asked	1
they	1
him,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
healed	1
wist	1
not	1
who	1
it	1
was:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
had	1
conveyed	1
himself	1
away,	1
a	1
multitude	1
being	1
in	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
5:14	1
Afterward	1
Jesus	1
findeth	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
made	1
whole:	1
sin	1
no	1
more,	1
lest	1
a	1
worse	1
thing	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
The	1
man	1
departed,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
whole.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
therefore	1
did	1
the	1
Jews	1
persecute	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
My	1
Father	1
worketh	1
hitherto,	1
and	1
I	1
work.	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
but	1
said	1
also	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
his	1
Father,	1
making	1
himself	1
equal	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
5:19	1
Then	1
answered	1
Jesus	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
Son	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
himself,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
Father	1
do:	1
for	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
he	1
doeth,	1
these	1
also	1
doeth	1
the	1
Son	1
likewise.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
himself	1
doeth:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
quickeneth	1
them;	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
Son	1
quickeneth	1
whom	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
judgeth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
hath	1
committed	1
all	1
judgment	1
unto	1
the	1
Son:	1
5:23	1
That	1
all	1
men	1
should	1
honour	1
the	1
Son,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
honour	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
He	1
that	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
5:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
condemnation;	1
but	1
is	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
5:25	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
have	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
5:27	1
And	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
authority	1
to	1
execute	1
judgment	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
5:28	1
Marvel	1
not	1
at	1
this:	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
graves	1
shall	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
5:29	1
And	1
shall	1
come	1
forth;	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
good,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
evil,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
damnation.	1
	1
5:30	1
I	1
can	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
do	1
nothing:	1
as	1
I	1
hear,	1
I	1
judge:	1
and	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
just;	1
because	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:31	1
If	1
I	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
my	1
witness	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
5:32	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
witness	1
which	1
he	1
witnesseth	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
5:33	1
Ye	1
sent	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
testimony	1
from	1
man:	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
5:35	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
burning	1
and	1
a	1
shining	1
light:	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
willing	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
light.	1
	1
5:36	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
greater	1
witness	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
John:	1
for	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
finish,	1
the	1
same	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
the	1
Father	1
himself,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
Ye	1
have	1
neither	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
nor	1
seen	1
his	1
shape.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
his	1
word	1
abiding	1
in	1
you:	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent,	1
him	1
ye	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
5:39	1
Search	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
ye	1
think	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
testify	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life.	1
	1
5:41	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
honour	1
from	1
men.	1
	1
5:42	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
5:43	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
me	1
not:	1
if	1
another	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
him	1
ye	1
will	1
receive.	1
	1
5:44	1
How	1
can	1
ye	1
believe,	1
which	1
receive	1
honour	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
seek	1
not	1
the	1
honour	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
5:45	1
Do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
accuse	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Father:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
accuseth	1
you,	1
even	1
Moses,	1
in	1
whom	1
ye	1
trust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
had	1
ye	1
believed	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
believed	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
wrote	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:47	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
his	1
writings,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe	1
my	1
words?	1
	1
6:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
diseased.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
passover,	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
nigh.	1
	1
6:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Whence	1
shall	1
we	1
buy	1
bread,	1
that	1
these	1
may	1
eat?	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
prove	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
himself	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
	1
6:7	1
Philip	1
answered	1
him,	1
Two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
take	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
6:8	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
6:9	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lad	1
here,	1
which	1
hath	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
small	1
fishes:	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
so	1
many?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Make	1
the	1
men	1
sit	1
down.	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
So	1
the	1
men	1
sat	1
down,	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
took	1
the	1
loaves;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
distributed	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
set	1
down;	1
and	1
likewise	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
6:12	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Gather	1
up	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remain,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
lost.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
they	1
gathered	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
filled	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
with	1
the	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
which	1
remained	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
eaten.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
those	1
men,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
that	1
prophet	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
king,	1
he	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
himself	1
alone.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
6:17	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
toward	1
Capernaum.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
dark,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
arose	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
that	1
blew.	1
	1
6:19	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
rowed	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
furlongs,	1
they	1
see	1
Jesus	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:20	1
But	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
they	1
willingly	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
day	1
following,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
boat	1
there,	1
save	1
that	1
one	1
whereinto	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
entered,	1
and	1
that	1
Jesus	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
boat,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
alone;	1
6:23	1
(Howbeit	1
there	1
came	1
other	1
boats	1
from	1
Tiberias	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
given	1
thanks:)	1
6:24	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
saw	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
neither	1
his	1
disciples,	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
shipping,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
seeking	1
for	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
when	1
camest	1
thou	1
hither?	1
	1
6:26	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
not	1
because	1
ye	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:27	1
Labour	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
which	1
perisheth,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
meat	1
which	1
endureth	1
unto	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
him	1
hath	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
sealed.	1
	1
6:28	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
6:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent.	1
	1
6:30	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
then,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
believe	1
thee?	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
work?	1
	1
6:31	1
Our	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
gave	1
them	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Moses	1
gave	1
you	1
not	1
that	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven;	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
giveth	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:33	1
For	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
giveth	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:34	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
evermore	1
give	1
us	1
this	1
bread.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
hunger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst.	1
	1
6:36	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
seen	1
me,	1
and	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
6:37	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
giveth	1
me	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
6:38	1
For	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Father's	1
will	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
nothing,	1
but	1
should	1
raise	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
seeth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him,	1
may	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:41	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
murmured	1
at	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
whose	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
we	1
know?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven?	1
	1
6:43	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Murmur	1
not	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
6:44	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
except	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
draw	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:45	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
taught	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
Every	1
man	1
therefore	1
that	1
hath	1
heard,	1
and	1
hath	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
cometh	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
6:46	1
Not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
6:47	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:48	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
bread	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:49	1
Your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
are	1
dead.	1
	1
6:50	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
and	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
6:51	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
living	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
this	1
bread,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
is	1
my	1
flesh,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:52	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
strove	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
How	1
can	1
this	1
man	1
give	1
us	1
his	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:53	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
drink	1
his	1
blood,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
6:54	1
Whoso	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:55	1
For	1
my	1
flesh	1
is	1
meat	1
indeed,	1
and	1
my	1
blood	1
is	1
drink	1
indeed.	1
	1
6:56	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:57	1
As	1
the	1
living	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
Father:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
me,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
6:58	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna,	1
and	1
are	1
dead:	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
this	1
bread	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:59	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
6:60	1
Many	1
therefore	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
this,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
hard	1
saying;	1
who	1
can	1
hear	1
it?	1
	1
6:61	1
When	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
murmured	1
at	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Doth	1
this	1
offend	1
you?	1
	1
6:62	1
What	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
ascend	1
up	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
before?	1
	1
6:63	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
quickeneth;	1
the	1
flesh	1
profiteth	1
nothing:	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
they	1
are	1
spirit,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
life.	1
	1
6:64	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
not.	1
For	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
and	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
6:65	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
6:66	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
back,	1
and	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:67	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
twelve,	1
Will	1
ye	1
also	1
go	1
away?	1
	1
6:68	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
to	1
whom	1
shall	1
we	1
go?	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:69	1
And	1
we	1
believe	1
and	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
6:70	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
chosen	1
you	1
twelve,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
6:71	1
He	1
spake	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon:	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
7:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
Galilee:	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
Jewry,	1
because	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
7:2	1
Now	1
the	1
Jew's	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles	1
was	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
7:3	1
His	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Depart	1
hence,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
that	1
thy	1
disciples	1
also	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
openly.	1
If	1
thou	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
neither	1
did	1
his	1
brethren	1
believe	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come:	1
but	1
your	1
time	1
is	1
alway	1
ready.	1
	1
7:7	1
The	1
world	1
cannot	1
hate	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
it	1
hateth,	1
because	1
I	1
testify	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
thereof	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
7:8	1
Go	1
ye	1
up	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
up	1
yet	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
for	1
my	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
full	1
come.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
abode	1
still	1
in	1
Galilee.	1
	1
7:10	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
gone	1
up,	1
then	1
went	1
he	1
also	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
openly,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
7:11	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
feast,	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
7:12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
murmuring	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
him:	1
for	1
some	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man:	1
others	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
7:13	1
Howbeit	1
no	1
man	1
spake	1
openly	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
7:14	1
Now	1
about	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
knoweth	1
this	1
man	1
letters,	1
having	1
never	1
learned?	1
	1
7:16	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
doctrine	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
his	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
myself.	1
	1
7:18	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
of	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
his	1
own	1
glory:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
his	1
glory	1
that	1
sent	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:19	1
Did	1
not	1
Moses	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
keepeth	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
Why	1
go	1
ye	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me?	1
	1
7:20	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil:	1
who	1
goeth	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
thee?	1
	1
7:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
one	1
work,	1
and	1
ye	1
all	1
marvel.	1
	1
7:22	1
Moses	1
therefore	1
gave	1
unto	1
you	1
circumcision;	1
(not	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
Moses,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
fathers;)	1
and	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
circumcise	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
7:23	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
receive	1
circumcision,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
broken;	1
are	1
ye	1
angry	1
at	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
man	1
every	1
whit	1
whole	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
7:24	1
Judge	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
appearance,	1
but	1
judge	1
righteous	1
judgment.	1
	1
7:25	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he,	1
whom	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
kill?	1
	1
7:26	1
But,	1
lo,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
boldly,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
nothing	1
unto	1
him.	1
Do	1
the	1
rulers	1
know	1
indeed	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Christ?	1
7:27	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
man	1
whence	1
he	1
is:	1
but	1
when	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
7:28	1
Then	1
cried	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
as	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
both	1
know	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:30	1
Then	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
more	1
miracles	1
than	1
these	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done?	1
7:32	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
such	1
things	1
concerning	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
sent	1
officers	1
to	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:34	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
7:35	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Whither	1
will	1
he	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him?	1
will	1
he	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
dispersed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
teach	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
7:36	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
saying	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come?	1
	1
7:37	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
thirst,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
7:38	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
said,	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly	1
shall	1
flow	1
rivers	1
of	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
7:39	1
(But	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
should	1
receive:	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
given;	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
glorified.)	1
	1
7:40	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying,	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Prophet.	1
	1
7:41	1
Others	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
Christ.	1
But	1
some	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Christ	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
7:42	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
scripture	1
said,	1
That	1
Christ	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
where	1
David	1
was?	1
	1
7:43	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
7:45	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
brought	1
him?	1
	1
7:46	1
The	1
officers	1
answered,	1
Never	1
man	1
spake	1
like	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
7:47	1
Then	1
answered	1
them	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
deceived?	1
	1
7:48	1
Have	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
believed	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
7:49	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
cursed.	1
	1
7:50	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
(he	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
them,)	1
7:51	1
Doth	1
our	1
law	1
judge	1
any	1
man,	1
before	1
it	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
doeth?	1
	1
7:52	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
Search,	1
and	1
look:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee	1
ariseth	1
no	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:53	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:1	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
8:4	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act.	1
	1
8:5	1
Now	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
commanded	1
us,	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
be	1
stoned:	1
but	1
what	1
sayest	1
thou?	1
	1
8:6	1
This	1
they	1
said,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
8:7	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
continued	1
asking	1
him,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
without	1
sin	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
first	1
cast	1
a	1
stone	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
heard	1
it,	1
being	1
convicted	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
conscience,	1
went	1
out	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
last:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
saw	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
woman,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
where	1
are	1
those	1
thine	1
accusers?	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
condemned	1
thee?	1
	1
8:11	1
She	1
said,	1
No	1
man,	1
Lord.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
thee:	1
go,	1
and	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
me	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
but	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
bearest	1
record	1
of	1
thyself;	1
thy	1
record	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
8:14	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
of	1
myself,	1
yet	1
my	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go;	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
tell	1
whence	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
8:15	1
Ye	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
I	1
judge	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
I	1
judge,	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
that	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
two	1
men	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
8:18	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
Father?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Ye	1
neither	1
know	1
me,	1
nor	1
my	1
Father:	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
8:20	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
treasury,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Will	1
he	1
kill	1
himself?	1
because	1
he	1
saith,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
from	1
beneath;	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
above:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
world;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
8:24	1
I	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
8:25	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Even	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
8:26	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true;	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:27	1
They	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
8:28	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
taught	1
me,	1
I	1
speak	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
me	1
alone;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
always	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
him.	1
	1
8:30	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
those	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
my	1
word,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
my	1
disciples	1
indeed;	1
8:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free.	1
	1
8:33	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
were	1
never	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
free?	1
	1
8:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:35	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
abideth	1
ever.	1
	1
8:36	1
If	1
the	1
Son	1
therefore	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
indeed.	1
	1
8:37	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
Abraham's	1
seed;	1
but	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
word	1
hath	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:38	1
I	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
8:39	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham	1
is	1
our	1
father.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
Abraham's	1
children,	1
ye	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
God:	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:41	1
Ye	1
do	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
father.	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
born	1
of	1
fornication;	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
Father,	1
even	1
God.	1
	1
8:42	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
God	1
were	1
your	1
Father,	1
ye	1
would	1
love	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
God;	1
neither	1
came	1
I	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:43	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
understand	1
my	1
speech?	1
even	1
because	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hear	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
8:44	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
ye	1
will	1
do.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
abode	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
truth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
speaketh	1
a	1
lie,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
of	1
his	1
own:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
ye	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:46	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
convinceth	1
me	1
of	1
sin?	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
me?	1
	1
8:47	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
God's	1
words:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
hear	1
them	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:48	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
we	1
not	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Samaritan,	1
and	1
hast	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
8:49	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
devil;	1
but	1
I	1
honour	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
dishonour	1
me.	1
	1
8:50	1
And	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
glory:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
seeketh	1
and	1
judgeth.	1
	1
8:51	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
death.	1
	1
8:52	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
Abraham	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
and	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
taste	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
8:53	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
is	1
dead?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
dead:	1
whom	1
makest	1
thou	1
thyself?	1
	1
8:54	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
If	1
I	1
honour	1
myself,	1
my	1
honour	1
is	1
nothing:	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
that	1
honoureth	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
God:	1
8:55	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
like	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
saying.	1
	1
8:56	1
Your	1
father	1
Abraham	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
day:	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
8:57	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
yet	1
fifty	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
Abraham?	1
	1
8:58	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Before	1
Abraham	1
was,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
8:59	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
up	1
stones	1
to	1
cast	1
at	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
hid	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
blind	1
from	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
who	1
did	1
sin,	1
this	1
man,	1
or	1
his	1
parents,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
	1
9:3	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
sinned,	1
nor	1
his	1
parents:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:4	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
day:	1
the	1
night	1
cometh,	1
when	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
work.	1
	1
9:5	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
9:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
made	1
clay	1
of	1
the	1
spittle,	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
clay,	1
9:7	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
wash	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
(which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
Sent.)	1
He	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
therefore,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
came	1
seeing.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
neighbours	1
therefore,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
before	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
blind,	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
and	1
begged?	1
	1
9:9	1
Some	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
he:	1
others	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
9:10	1
Therefore	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
were	1
thine	1
eyes	1
opened?	1
	1
9:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Jesus	1
made	1
clay,	1
and	1
anointed	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
and	1
wash:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
I	1
received	1
sight.	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
9:13	1
They	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
him	1
that	1
aforetime	1
was	1
blind.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
when	1
Jesus	1
made	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:15	1
Then	1
again	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
put	1
clay	1
upon	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
washed,	1
and	1
do	1
see.	1
	1
9:16	1
Therefore	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
keepeth	1
not	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
Others	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner	1
do	1
such	1
miracles?	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
again,	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
He	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
blind,	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
until	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
ye	1
say	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
how	1
then	1
doth	1
he	1
now	1
see?	1
	1
9:20	1
His	1
parents	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind:	1
9:21	1
But	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
now	1
seeth,	1
we	1
know	1
not;	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
we	1
know	1
not:	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:22	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
agreed	1
already,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
did	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
9:23	1
Therefore	1
said	1
his	1
parents,	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:24	1
Then	1
again	1
called	1
they	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
blind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
God	1
the	1
praise:	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
9:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sinner	1
or	1
no,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
know,	1
that,	1
whereas	1
I	1
was	1
blind,	1
now	1
I	1
see.	1
	1
9:26	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him	1
again,	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
to	1
thee?	1
how	1
opened	1
he	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
	1
9:27	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,	1
and	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
wherefore	1
would	1
ye	1
hear	1
it	1
again?	1
will	1
ye	1
also	1
be	1
his	1
disciples?	1
	1
9:28	1
Then	1
they	1
reviled	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
his	1
disciple;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
Moses'	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:29	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
fellow,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
9:30	1
The	1
man	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
herein	1
is	1
a	1
marvellous	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:31	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
sinners:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
doeth	1
his	1
will,	1
him	1
he	1
heareth.	1
	1
9:32	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
heard	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
blind.	1
	1
9:33	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
9:34	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wast	1
altogether	1
born	1
in	1
sins,	1
and	1
dost	1
thou	1
teach	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
9:35	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
9:36	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
he,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
believe	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
both	1
seen	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
talketh	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
For	1
judgment	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
not	1
might	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
blind.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Are	1
we	1
blind	1
also?	1
	1
9:41	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
blind,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
see;	1
therefore	1
your	1
sin	1
remaineth.	1
	1
10:1	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
entereth	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sheepfold,	1
but	1
climbeth	1
up	1
some	1
other	1
way,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
10:2	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:3	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
porter	1
openeth;	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
hear	1
his	1
voice:	1
and	1
he	1
calleth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
putteth	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
follow	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
a	1
stranger	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
follow,	1
but	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
strangers.	1
	1
10:6	1
This	1
parable	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
were	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
again,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:8	1
All	1
that	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me	1
are	1
thieves	1
and	1
robbers:	1
but	1
the	1
sheep	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:9	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door:	1
by	1
me	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
enter	1
in,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out,	1
and	1
find	1
pasture.	1
	1
10:10	1
The	1
thief	1
cometh	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
to	1
steal,	1
and	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
abundantly.	1
	1
10:11	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd:	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
giveth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
whose	1
own	1
the	1
sheep	1
are	1
not,	1
seeth	1
the	1
wolf	1
coming,	1
and	1
leaveth	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
fleeth:	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
catcheth	1
them,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:13	1
The	1
hireling	1
fleeth,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
careth	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:14	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
am	1
known	1
of	1
mine.	1
	1
10:15	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
know	1
I	1
the	1
Father:	1
and	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
fold:	1
them	1
also	1
I	1
must	1
bring,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold,	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:17	1
Therefore	1
doth	1
my	1
Father	1
love	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
10:18	1
No	1
man	1
taketh	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
This	1
commandment	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
10:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
therefore	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
for	1
these	1
sayings.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
is	1
mad;	1
why	1
hear	1
ye	1
him?	1
	1
10:21	1
Others	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
Can	1
a	1
devil	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
dedication,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
winter.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
10:24	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
Jews	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
dost	1
thou	1
make	1
us	1
to	1
doubt?	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
tell	1
us	1
plainly.	1
	1
10:25	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
not:	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
they	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
sheep,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:27	1
My	1
sheep	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
follow	1
me:	1
10:28	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
perish,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
10:29	1
My	1
Father,	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
me,	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Father's	1
hand.	1
	1
10:30	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
10:31	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
up	1
stones	1
again	1
to	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
10:32	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Many	1
good	1
works	1
have	1
I	1
shewed	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
Father;	1
for	1
which	1
of	1
those	1
works	1
do	1
ye	1
stone	1
me?	1
	1
10:33	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
we	1
stone	1
thee	1
not;	1
but	1
for	1
blasphemy;	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
man,	1
makest	1
thyself	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
I	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
gods?	1
	1
10:35	1
If	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
gods,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
scripture	1
cannot	1
be	1
broken;	1
10:36	1
Say	1
ye	1
of	1
him,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
Thou	1
blasphemest;	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
10:37	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
do,	1
though	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
me,	1
believe	1
the	1
works:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know,	1
and	1
believe,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sought	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand,	1
10:40	1
And	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
John	1
at	1
first	1
baptized;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
abode.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
many	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
John	1
did	1
no	1
miracle:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
John	1
spake	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
true.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
sick,	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
of	1
Bethany,	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
Martha.	1
	1
11:2	1
(It	1
was	1
that	1
Mary	1
which	1
anointed	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair,	1
whose	1
brother	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
sick.)	1
	1
11:3	1
Therefore	1
his	1
sisters	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
11:4	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
sickness	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
glorified	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:5	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
Martha,	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
Lazarus.	1
	1
11:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
he	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
11:7	1
Then	1
after	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea	1
again.	1
	1
11:8	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
late	1
sought	1
to	1
stone	1
thee;	1
and	1
goest	1
thou	1
thither	1
again?	1
	1
11:9	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
twelve	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
he	1
stumbleth	1
not,	1
because	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
stumbleth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
11:11	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Our	1
friend	1
Lazarus	1
sleepeth;	1
but	1
I	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
awake	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
he	1
sleep,	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
11:13	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
taking	1
of	1
rest	1
in	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
plainly,	1
Lazarus	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
ye	1
may	1
believe;	1
nevertheless	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Thomas,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
unto	1
his	1
fellowdisciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
also	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
die	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:17	1
Then	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
four	1
days	1
already.	1
	1
11:18	1
Now	1
Bethany	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
furlongs	1
off:	1
11:19	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
came	1
to	1
Martha	1
and	1
Mary,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
brother.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
Martha,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming,	1
went	1
and	1
met	1
him:	1
but	1
Mary	1
sat	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
11:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Martha	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
11:23	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
Martha	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
11:25	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
in	1
me,	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
dead,	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
live:	1
11:26	1
And	1
whosoever	1
liveth	1
and	1
believeth	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
die.	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this?	1
	1
11:27	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord:	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
she	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
called	1
Mary	1
her	1
sister	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Master	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
calleth	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:29	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that,	1
she	1
arose	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:30	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
where	1
Martha	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
comforted	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Mary,	1
that	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
hastily	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
followed	1
her,	1
saying,	1
She	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
grave	1
to	1
weep	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
Then	1
when	1
Mary	1
was	1
come	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:33	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
her	1
weeping,	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
weeping	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
groaned	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
troubled.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
said,	1
Where	1
have	1
ye	1
laid	1
him?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
11:35	1
Jesus	1
wept.	1
	1
11:36	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
how	1
he	1
loved	1
him!	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
Could	1
not	1
this	1
man,	1
which	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
even	1
this	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
died?	1
	1
11:38	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
again	1
groaning	1
in	1
himself	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
a	1
stone	1
lay	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:39	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Take	1
ye	1
away	1
the	1
stone.	1
Martha,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
dead,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
stinketh:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
dead	1
four	1
days.	1
	1
11:40	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Said	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
believe,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
11:41	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
dead	1
was	1
laid.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me.	1
	1
11:42	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
hearest	1
me	1
always:	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stand	1
by	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
11:43	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thus	1
had	1
spoken,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lazarus,	1
come	1
forth.	1
	1
11:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
came	1
forth,	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
with	1
graveclothes:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
bound	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
napkin.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Loose	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Mary,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
11:46	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
11:47	1
Then	1
gathered	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
do	1
we?	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
doeth	1
many	1
miracles.	1
	1
11:48	1
If	1
we	1
let	1
him	1
thus	1
alone,	1
all	1
men	1
will	1
believe	1
on	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Romans	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
both	1
our	1
place	1
and	1
nation.	1
	1
11:49	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
named	1
Caiaphas,	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
11:50	1
Nor	1
consider	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
11:51	1
And	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
of	1
himself:	1
but	1
being	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
year,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
that	1
Jesus	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
that	1
nation;	1
11:52	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
nation	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
also	1
he	1
should	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
11:53	1
Then	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
they	1
took	1
counsel	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:54	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
among	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
went	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
country	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
there	1
continued	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:55	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand:	1
and	1
many	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
before	1
the	1
passover,	1
to	1
purify	1
themselves.	1
	1
11:56	1
Then	1
sought	1
they	1
for	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
What	1
think	1
ye,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast?	1
	1
11:57	1
Now	1
both	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
commandment,	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
were,	1
he	1
should	1
shew	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
six	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
passover	1
came	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
where	1
Lazarus	1
was,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dead,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:2	1
There	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
supper;	1
and	1
Martha	1
served:	1
but	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
Then	1
took	1
Mary	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard,	1
very	1
costly,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
saith	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
which	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
12:5	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
ointment	1
sold	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor?	1
	1
12:6	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
poor;	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
bare	1
what	1
was	1
put	1
therein.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone:	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
burying	1
hath	1
she	1
kept	1
this.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
ye	1
have	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
12:9	1
Much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
see	1
Lazarus	1
also,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:10	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
Lazarus	1
also	1
to	1
death;	1
12:11	1
Because	1
that	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
believed	1
on	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:12	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
much	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
12:13	1
Took	1
branches	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
Hosanna:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
young	1
ass,	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
12:15	1
Fear	1
not,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh,	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
ass's	1
colt.	1
	1
12:16	1
These	1
things	1
understood	1
not	1
his	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
but	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
glorified,	1
then	1
remembered	1
they	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:17	1
The	1
people	1
therefore	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
Lazarus	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grave,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
bare	1
record.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
met	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
miracle.	1
	1
12:19	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Perceive	1
ye	1
how	1
ye	1
prevail	1
nothing?	1
behold,	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
gone	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
Greeks	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
12:21	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
therefore	1
to	1
Philip,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
desired	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:22	1
Philip	1
cometh	1
and	1
telleth	1
Andrew:	1
and	1
again	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Philip	1
tell	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
come,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
12:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
a	1
corn	1
of	1
wheat	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
die,	1
it	1
abideth	1
alone:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
die,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:25	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
follow	1
me;	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
my	1
servant	1
be:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
my	1
Father	1
honour.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
is	1
my	1
soul	1
troubled;	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
Father,	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
hour:	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
this	1
hour.	1
	1
12:28	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name.	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
glorified	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
glorify	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
12:29	1
The	1
people	1
therefore,	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
thundered:	1
others	1
said,	1
An	1
angel	1
spake	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:30	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
voice	1
came	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes.	1
	1
12:31	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
now	1
shall	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
be	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
I,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
will	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
12:33	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
12:34	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
Christ	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
lifted	1
up?	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Son	1
of	1
man?	1
	1
12:35	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
Walk	1
while	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
darkness	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth.	1
	1
12:36	1
While	1
ye	1
have	1
light,	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
These	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
did	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
12:37	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
many	1
miracles	1
before	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
on	1
him:	1
12:38	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
hath	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
been	1
revealed?	1
	1
12:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
believe,	1
because	1
that	1
Esaias	1
said	1
again,	1
12:40	1
He	1
hath	1
blinded	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
heart;	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
nor	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
12:41	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
Esaias,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
12:42	1
Nevertheless	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
rulers	1
also	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him;	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
him,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
12:43	1
For	1
they	1
loved	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:44	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
believeth	1
not	1
on	1
me,	1
but	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:45	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
seeth	1
me	1
seeth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:46	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
a	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
should	1
not	1
abide	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
believe	1
not,	1
I	1
judge	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
12:48	1
He	1
that	1
rejecteth	1
me,	1
and	1
receiveth	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
hath	1
one	1
that	1
judgeth	1
him:	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
judge	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
12:49	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
sent	1
me,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
commandment,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
speak.	1
	1
12:50	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
commandment	1
is	1
life	1
everlasting:	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
speak	1
therefore,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
before	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
having	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
loved	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
supper	1
being	1
ended,	1
the	1
devil	1
having	1
now	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
to	1
betray	1
him;	1
13:3	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
had	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
God;	1
13:4	1
He	1
riseth	1
from	1
supper,	1
and	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
garments;	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
girded	1
himself.	1
	1
13:5	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
poureth	1
water	1
into	1
a	1
bason,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
disciples'	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
towel	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
girded.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter:	1
and	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
wash	1
my	1
feet?	1
	1
13:7	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
I	1
do	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
hereafter.	1
	1
13:8	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
wash	1
my	1
feet.	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
wash	1
thee	1
not,	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
part	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
13:9	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
not	1
my	1
feet	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
13:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
washed	1
needeth	1
not	1
save	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
but	1
is	1
clean	1
every	1
whit:	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
clean,	1
but	1
not	1
all.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him;	1
therefore	1
said	1
he,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
clean.	1
	1
13:12	1
So	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
again,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
13:13	1
Ye	1
call	1
me	1
Master	1
and	1
Lord:	1
and	1
ye	1
say	1
well;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:14	1
If	1
I	1
then,	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
Master,	1
have	1
washed	1
your	1
feet;	1
ye	1
also	1
ought	1
to	1
wash	1
one	1
another's	1
feet.	1
	1
13:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:16	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord;	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
sent	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
13:17	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
you	1
all:	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
bread	1
with	1
me	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
heel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
13:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
send	1
receiveth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
13:21	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified,	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
13:22	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
looked	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
doubting	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:23	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
leaning	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
bosom	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved.	1
	1
13:24	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:25	1
He	1
then	1
lying	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
breast	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
13:26	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
sop,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
dipped	1
it.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
dipped	1
the	1
sop,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
sop	1
Satan	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
That	1
thou	1
doest,	1
do	1
quickly.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
no	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:29	1
For	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thought,	1
because	1
Judas	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Buy	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
against	1
the	1
feast;	1
or,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
13:30	1
He	1
then	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sop	1
went	1
immediately	1
out:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
night.	1
	1
13:31	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
glorified,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
glorified	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
13:32	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
also	1
glorify	1
him	1
in	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
straightway	1
glorify	1
him.	1
	1
13:33	1
Little	1
children,	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you.	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come;	1
so	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:34	1
A	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
13:35	1
By	1
this	1
shall	1
all	1
men	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
disciples,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
love	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
13:36	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
follow	1
me	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
follow	1
me	1
afterwards.	1
	1
13:37	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
why	1
cannot	1
I	1
follow	1
thee	1
now?	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
13:38	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
denied	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:1	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled:	1
ye	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
believe	1
also	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:2	1
In	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
are	1
many	1
mansions:	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
receive	1
you	1
unto	1
myself;	1
that	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
ye	1
know,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
14:5	1
Thomas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest;	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
14:6	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
no	1
man	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also:	1
and	1
from	1
henceforth	1
ye	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
14:8	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known	1
me,	1
Philip?	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
me	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou	1
then,	1
Shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
14:10	1
Believest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
myself:	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
doeth	1
the	1
works.	1
	1
14:11	1
Believe	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me:	1
or	1
else	1
believe	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
works'	1
sake.	1
	1
14:12	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
also;	1
and	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
14:14	1
If	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
14:15	1
If	1
ye	1
love	1
me,	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
another	1
Comforter,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
abide	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
ever;	1
14:17	1
Even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth;	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
cannot	1
receive,	1
because	1
it	1
seeth	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
him:	1
but	1
ye	1
know	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
you	1
comfortless:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
seeth	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
ye	1
see	1
me:	1
because	1
I	1
live,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
also.	1
	1
14:20	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:21	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
them,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
loveth	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
loved	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
manifest	1
myself	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
14:22	1
Judas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
not	1
Iscariot,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
manifest	1
thyself	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
14:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
love	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
words:	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
our	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:24	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
not	1
keepeth	1
not	1
my	1
sayings:	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
hear	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
the	1
Father's	1
which	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
14:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
being	1
yet	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:26	1
But	1
the	1
Comforter,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
will	1
send	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
bring	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
your	1
remembrance,	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:27	1
Peace	1
I	1
leave	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
peace	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
giveth,	1
give	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
how	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
go	1
away,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you.	1
If	1
ye	1
loved	1
me,	1
ye	1
would	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father:	1
for	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
14:30	1
Hereafter	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
talk	1
much	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
cometh,	1
and	1
hath	1
nothing	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
gave	1
me	1
commandment,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do.	1
Arise,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
hence.	1
	1
15:1	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
true	1
vine,	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
the	1
husbandman.	1
	1
15:2	1
Every	1
branch	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
beareth	1
not	1
fruit	1
he	1
taketh	1
away:	1
and	1
every	1
branch	1
that	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
he	1
purgeth	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
more	1
fruit.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
clean	1
through	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:4	1
Abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
As	1
the	1
branch	1
cannot	1
bear	1
fruit	1
of	1
itself,	1
except	1
it	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
vine;	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
15:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
vine,	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
branches:	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit:	1
for	1
without	1
me	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:6	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
abide	1
not	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
cast	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
branch,	1
and	1
is	1
withered;	1
and	1
men	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
burned.	1
	1
15:7	1
If	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
what	1
ye	1
will,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:8	1
Herein	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
glorified,	1
that	1
ye	1
bear	1
much	1
fruit;	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:9	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
loved	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
loved	1
you:	1
continue	1
ye	1
in	1
my	1
love.	1
	1
15:10	1
If	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
my	1
love;	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
Father's	1
commandments,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
15:11	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
might	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
15:12	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
commandment,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you.	1
	1
15:13	1
Greater	1
love	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
his	1
friends.	1
	1
15:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
not	1
servants;	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
not	1
what	1
his	1
lord	1
doeth:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
you	1
friends;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:16	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
chosen	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you,	1
and	1
ordained	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
fruit	1
should	1
remain:	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:18	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
hated	1
me	1
before	1
it	1
hated	1
you.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
love	1
his	1
own:	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
hateth	1
you.	1
	1
15:20	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me,	1
they	1
will	1
also	1
persecute	1
you;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
saying,	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
yours	1
also.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
15:22	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
cloak	1
for	1
their	1
sin.	1
	1
15:23	1
He	1
that	1
hateth	1
me	1
hateth	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
15:24	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
none	1
other	1
man	1
did,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
they	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
hated	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
this	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
law,	1
They	1
hated	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Comforter	1
is	1
come,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
which	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
shall	1
testify	1
of	1
me:	1
15:27	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
bear	1
witness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
16:1	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
16:2	1
They	1
shall	1
put	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues:	1
yea,	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
killeth	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
doeth	1
God	1
service.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
Father,	1
nor	1
me.	1
	1
16:4	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come,	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:5	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
asketh	1
me,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
sorrow	1
hath	1
filled	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
16:7	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth;	1
It	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
away:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
away,	1
the	1
Comforter	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
depart,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
sin,	1
and	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment:	1
16:9	1
Of	1
sin,	1
because	1
they	1
believe	1
not	1
on	1
me;	1
16:10	1
Of	1
righteousness,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
16:11	1
Of	1
judgment,	1
because	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
judged.	1
	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them	1
now.	1
	1
16:13	1
Howbeit	1
when	1
he,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
into	1
all	1
truth:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
himself;	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
hear,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
speak:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
shall	1
glorify	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:15	1
All	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
are	1
mine:	1
therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:16	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:17	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
themselves,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
us,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me:	1
and,	1
Because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
16:18	1
They	1
said	1
therefore,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
little	1
while?	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
16:19	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
enquire	1
among	1
yourselves	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me?	1
	1
16:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
lament,	1
but	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
but	1
your	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
joy.	1
	1
16:21	1
A	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
travail	1
hath	1
sorrow,	1
because	1
her	1
hour	1
is	1
come:	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
delivered	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
she	1
remembereth	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
anguish,	1
for	1
joy	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
ye	1
now	1
therefore	1
have	1
sorrow:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
and	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
me	1
nothing.	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
Hitherto	1
have	1
ye	1
asked	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
ask,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
16:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs:	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
plainly	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:26	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
you:	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
himself	1
loveth	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:28	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world:	1
again,	1
I	1
leave	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:29	1
His	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
now	1
speakest	1
thou	1
plainly,	1
and	1
speakest	1
no	1
proverb.	1
	1
16:30	1
Now	1
are	1
we	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
needest	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
ask	1
thee:	1
by	1
this	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:31	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
now	1
believe?	1
	1
16:32	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
yea,	1
is	1
now	1
come,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
me	1
alone:	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
because	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:33	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
world	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation:	1
but	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
I	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:1	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
glorify	1
thy	1
Son,	1
that	1
thy	1
Son	1
also	1
may	1
glorify	1
thee:	1
17:2	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
power	1
over	1
all	1
flesh,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
eternal	1
life	1
to	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
eternal,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
thee	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent.	1
	1
17:4	1
I	1
have	1
glorified	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thou	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
was.	1
	1
17:6	1
I	1
have	1
manifested	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
thine	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
17:7	1
Now	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
surely	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
all	1
mine	1
are	1
thine,	1
and	1
thine	1
are	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
glorified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
keep	1
through	1
thine	1
own	1
name	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
are.	1
	1
17:12	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
name:	1
those	1
that	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
kept,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
now	1
come	1
I	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
my	1
joy	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
themselves.	1
	1
17:14	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
thy	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
hated	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:15	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
17:16	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:17	1
Sanctify	1
them	1
through	1
thy	1
truth:	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
17:18	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
I	1
sanctify	1
myself,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
might	1
be	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
17:20	1
Neither	1
pray	1
I	1
for	1
these	1
alone,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
me	1
through	1
their	1
word;	1
17:21	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
one;	1
as	1
thou,	1
Father,	1
art	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
us:	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
one:	1
17:23	1
I	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
one;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
loved	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me.	1
	1
17:24	1
Father,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
they	1
also,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
am;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
behold	1
my	1
glory,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:25	1
O	1
righteous	1
Father,	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
not	1
known	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
thee,	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
will	1
declare	1
it:	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Cedron,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
garden,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
entered,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
knew	1
the	1
place:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
ofttimes	1
resorted	1
thither	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:3	1
Judas	1
then,	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
cometh	1
thither	1
with	1
lanterns	1
and	1
torches	1
and	1
weapons.	1
	1
18:4	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
knowing	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
	1
18:5	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
stood	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:6	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
they	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
asked	1
he	1
them	1
again,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
18:8	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
if	1
therefore	1
ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
let	1
these	1
go	1
their	1
way:	1
18:9	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Of	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
have	1
I	1
lost	1
none.	1
	1
18:10	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
having	1
a	1
sword	1
drew	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
servant,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
The	1
servant's	1
name	1
was	1
Malchus.	1
	1
18:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Put	1
up	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
sheath:	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
drink	1
it?	1
	1
18:12	1
Then	1
the	1
band	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
18:13	1
And	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Annas	1
first;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
Caiaphas,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year.	1
	1
18:14	1
Now	1
Caiaphas	1
was	1
he,	1
which	1
gave	1
counsel	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
followed	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
another	1
disciple:	1
that	1
disciple	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
without.	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
Peter.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
damsel	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
man's	1
disciples?	1
He	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
officers	1
stood	1
there,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cold:	1
and	1
they	1
warmed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
Peter	1
stood	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
	1
18:19	1
The	1
high	1
priest	1
then	1
asked	1
Jesus	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
18:20	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
spake	1
openly	1
to	1
the	1
world;	1
I	1
ever	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
whither	1
the	1
Jews	1
always	1
resort;	1
and	1
in	1
secret	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
18:21	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
me?	1
ask	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
me,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
behold,	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
which	1
stood	1
by	1
struck	1
Jesus	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
so?	1
	1
18:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
evil,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
well,	1
why	1
smitest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
18:24	1
Now	1
Annas	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
bound	1
unto	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
stood	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples?	1
He	1
denied	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:26	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
being	1
his	1
kinsman	1
whose	1
ear	1
Peter	1
cut	1
off,	1
saith,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
him?	1
18:27	1
Peter	1
then	1
denied	1
again:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
led	1
they	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Caiaphas	1
unto	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
judgment:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
early;	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
went	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
defiled;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
eat	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
18:29	1
Pilate	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
accusation	1
bring	1
ye	1
against	1
this	1
man?	1
	1
18:30	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
malefactor,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
judge	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
law.	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
put	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
death:	1
18:32	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
18:33	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall	1
again,	1
and	1
called	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sayest	1
thou	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
thyself,	1
or	1
did	1
others	1
tell	1
it	1
thee	1
of	1
me?	1
	1
18:35	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
Jew?	1
Thine	1
own	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
have	1
delivered	1
thee	1
unto	1
me:	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
18:36	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
My	1
kingdom	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
if	1
my	1
kingdom	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
then	1
would	1
my	1
servants	1
fight,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Jews:	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
my	1
kingdom	1
not	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
18:37	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
king	1
then?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
king.	1
To	1
this	1
end	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
heareth	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
18:38	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
truth?	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
fault	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:39	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
a	1
custom,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
passover:	1
will	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:40	1
Then	1
cried	1
they	1
all	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
this	1
man,	1
but	1
Barabbas.	1
Now	1
Barabbas	1
was	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
19:1	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
scourged	1
him.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
purple	1
robe,	1
19:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
19:4	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:5	1
Then	1
came	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
wearing	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
purple	1
robe.	1
And	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man!	1
	1
19:6	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
therefore	1
and	1
officers	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
crucify	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:8	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
afraid;	1
19:9	1
And	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
But	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Speakest	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
me?	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
crucify	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
release	1
thee?	1
	1
19:11	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
couldest	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
thee	1
from	1
above:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
unto	1
thee	1
hath	1
the	1
greater	1
sin.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
Pilate	1
sought	1
to	1
release	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
Jews	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
go,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
Caesar's	1
friend:	1
whosoever	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
speaketh	1
against	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:13	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
brought	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Pavement,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew,	1
Gabbatha.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
your	1
King!	1
	1
19:15	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
Away	1
with	1
him,	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
I	1
crucify	1
your	1
King?	1
The	1
chief	1
priests	1
answered,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
but	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
delivered	1
he	1
him	1
therefore	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
bearing	1
his	1
cross	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
Golgotha:	1
19:18	1
Where	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
with	1
him,	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
one,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
Pilate	1
wrote	1
a	1
title,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
cross.	1
And	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
JESUS	1
OF	1
NAZARETH	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
19:20	1
This	1
title	1
then	1
read	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was	1
crucified	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew,	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin.	1
	1
19:21	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
Write	1
not,	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
19:22	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
I	1
have	1
written.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
Jesus,	1
took	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
made	1
four	1
parts,	1
to	1
every	1
soldier	1
a	1
part;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
coat:	1
now	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
without	1
seam,	1
woven	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
throughout.	1
	1
19:24	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
rend	1
it,	1
but	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
it,	1
whose	1
it	1
shall	1
be:	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
raiment	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
vesture	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
lots.	1
These	1
things	1
therefore	1
the	1
soldiers	1
did.	1
	1
19:25	1
Now	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Jesus	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
Mary	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Cleophas,	1
and	1
Mary	1
Magdalene.	1
	1
19:26	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
disciple	1
standing	1
by,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
Woman,	1
behold	1
thy	1
son!	1
19:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
disciple,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
mother!	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
that	1
disciple	1
took	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
19:28	1
After	1
this,	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
now	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
saith,	1
I	1
thirst.	1
	1
19:29	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
a	1
vessel	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar:	1
and	1
they	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
19:30	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
vinegar,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
finished:	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
19:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
the	1
bodies	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
(for	1
that	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
an	1
high	1
day,)	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
their	1
legs	1
might	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
19:32	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
crucified	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:33	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
already,	1
they	1
brake	1
not	1
his	1
legs:	1
19:34	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
with	1
a	1
spear	1
pierced	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
came	1
there	1
out	1
blood	1
and	1
water.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
bare	1
record,	1
and	1
his	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
true,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
19:36	1
For	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
A	1
bone	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
again	1
another	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
They	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
they	1
pierced.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
being	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
but	1
secretly	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
him	1
leave.	1
He	1
came	1
therefore,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
Nicodemus,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
myrrh	1
and	1
aloes,	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
pound	1
weight.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wound	1
it	1
in	1
linen	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
spices,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
is	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:41	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
garden;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
a	1
new	1
sepulchre,	1
wherein	1
was	1
never	1
man	1
yet	1
laid.	1
	1
19:42	1
There	1
laid	1
they	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews'	1
preparation	1
day;	1
for	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
cometh	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
early,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
dark,	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
stone	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
she	1
runneth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
disciple,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:3	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:4	1
So	1
they	1
ran	1
both	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
disciple	1
did	1
outrun	1
Peter,	1
and	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
he	1
stooping	1
down,	1
and	1
looking	1
in,	1
saw	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lying;	1
yet	1
went	1
he	1
not	1
in.	1
	1
20:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
following	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lie,	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
napkin,	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
not	1
lying	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
but	1
wrapped	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
itself.	1
	1
20:8	1
Then	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
he	1
saw,	1
and	1
believed.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
as	1
yet	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
scripture,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
Mary	1
stood	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
weeping:	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
wept,	1
she	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
20:12	1
And	1
seeth	1
two	1
angels	1
in	1
white	1
sitting,	1
the	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
feet,	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lain.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
she	1
turned	1
herself	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
standing,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
20:15	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
whom	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
She,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
gardener,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
if	1
thou	1
have	1
borne	1
him	1
hence,	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
20:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Mary.	1
She	1
turned	1
herself,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabboni;	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Master.	1
	1
20:17	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Touch	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
ascended	1
to	1
my	1
Father:	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
ascend	1
unto	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
your	1
Father;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:18	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
disciples	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
20:19	1
Then	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
at	1
evening,	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut	1
where	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
assembled	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
he	1
shewed	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
disciples	1
glad,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
send	1
I	1
you.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
breathed	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Receive	1
ye	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
20:23	1
Whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
remit,	1
they	1
are	1
remitted	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
retain,	1
they	1
are	1
retained.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
Thomas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came.	1
	1
20:25	1
The	1
other	1
disciples	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Except	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
side,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
after	1
eight	1
days	1
again	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
within,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
with	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
doors	1
being	1
shut,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
Thomas,	1
Reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
behold	1
my	1
hands;	1
and	1
reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
side:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
faithless,	1
but	1
believing.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Thomas	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
LORD	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
20:29	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thomas,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed:	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
have	1
believed.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
signs	1
truly	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
20:31	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
written,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
that	1
believing	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life	1
through	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
21:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
shewed	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
21:2	1
There	1
were	1
together	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
and	1
Nathanael	1
of	1
Cana	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
21:3	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
a	1
fishing.	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
thee.	1
They	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
immediately;	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
caught	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore:	1
but	1
the	1
disciples	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:5	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
have	1
ye	1
any	1
meat?	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
No.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Cast	1
the	1
net	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find.	1
They	1
cast	1
therefore,	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
that	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Now	1
when	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord,	1
he	1
girt	1
his	1
fisher's	1
coat	1
unto	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
naked,)	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
disciples	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
ship;	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
land,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
cubits,)	1
dragging	1
the	1
net	1
with	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:9	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals	1
there,	1
and	1
fish	1
laid	1
thereon,	1
and	1
bread.	1
	1
21:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
now	1
caught.	1
	1
21:11	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
net	1
to	1
land	1
full	1
of	1
great	1
fishes,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
and	1
three:	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many,	1
yet	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
net	1
broken.	1
	1
21:12	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
dine.	1
And	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
durst	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
21:13	1
Jesus	1
then	1
cometh,	1
and	1
taketh	1
bread,	1
and	1
giveth	1
them,	1
and	1
fish	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:14	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
21:15	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
these?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
lambs.	1
	1
21:16	1
He	1
saith	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:17	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Peter	1
was	1
grieved	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:18	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
young,	1
thou	1
girdest	1
thyself,	1
and	1
walkedst	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest:	1
but	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
old,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hands,	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
gird	1
thee,	1
and	1
carry	1
thee	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not.	1
	1
21:19	1
This	1
spake	1
he,	1
signifying	1
by	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
glorify	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
21:20	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
turning	1
about,	1
seeth	1
the	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
following;	1
which	1
also	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
supper,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
thee?	1
	1
21:21	1
Peter	1
seeing	1
him	1
saith	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
do?	1
	1
21:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
follow	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
21:23	1
Then	1
went	1
this	1
saying	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
that	1
disciple	1
should	1
not	1
die:	1
yet	1
Jesus	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
die;	1
but,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
21:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
disciple	1
which	1
testifieth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
wrote	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
testimony	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
the	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
every	1
one,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
written.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Acts	1
of	1
the	1
Apostles	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
former	1
treatise	1
have	1
I	1
made,	1
O	1
Theophilus,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Jesus	1
began	1
both	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
teach,	1
1:2	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
had	1
given	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen:	1
1:3	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
alive	1
after	1
his	1
passion	1
by	1
many	1
infallible	1
proofs,	1
being	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
1:4	1
And,	1
being	1
assembled	1
together	1
with	1
them,	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
but	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
which,	1
saith	1
he,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
John	1
truly	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
hence.	1
	1
1:6	1
When	1
they	1
therefore	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
they	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
restore	1
again	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
Israel?	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
times	1
or	1
the	1
seasons,	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
power,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
me	1
both	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things,	1
while	1
they	1
beheld,	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up;	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
received	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
looked	1
stedfastly	1
toward	1
heaven	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
white	1
apparel;	1
1:11	1
Which	1
also	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
why	1
stand	1
ye	1
gazing	1
up	1
into	1
heaven?	1
this	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
you	1
into	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
so	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
go	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
returned	1
they	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
Olivet,	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
sabbath	1
day's	1
journey.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
upper	1
room,	1
where	1
abode	1
both	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
Zelotes,	1
and	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
1:14	1
These	1
all	1
continued	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication,	1
with	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
Peter	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
(the	1
number	1
of	1
names	1
together	1
were	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty,)	1
1:16	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
this	1
scripture	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
David	1
spake	1
before	1
concerning	1
Judas,	1
which	1
was	1
guide	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
took	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
had	1
obtained	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
this	1
man	1
purchased	1
a	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
falling	1
headlong,	1
he	1
burst	1
asunder	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bowels	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
dwellers	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
insomuch	1
as	1
that	1
field	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
tongue,	1
Aceldama,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
Let	1
his	1
habitation	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
and	1
his	1
bishoprick	1
let	1
another	1
take.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
companied	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
us,	1
1:22	1
Beginning	1
from	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
unto	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
us,	1
must	1
one	1
be	1
ordained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
with	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
they	1
appointed	1
two,	1
Joseph	1
called	1
Barsabas,	1
who	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Justus,	1
and	1
Matthias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
shew	1
whether	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
1:25	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
from	1
which	1
Judas	1
by	1
transgression	1
fell,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
forth	1
their	1
lots;	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Matthias;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
eleven	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost	1
was	1
fully	1
come,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
from	1
heaven	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
rushing	1
mighty	1
wind,	1
and	1
it	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
cloven	1
tongues	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
sat	1
upon	1
each	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
other	1
tongues,	1
as	1
the	1
Spirit	1
gave	1
them	1
utterance.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Jews,	1
devout	1
men,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
nation	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:6	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
noised	1
abroad,	1
the	1
multitude	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
confounded,	1
because	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
and	1
marvelled,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
which	1
speak	1
Galilaeans?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
how	1
hear	1
we	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
tongue,	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
born?	1
	1
2:9	1
Parthians,	1
and	1
Medes,	1
and	1
Elamites,	1
and	1
the	1
dwellers	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
and	1
in	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Cappadocia,	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
and	1
Asia,	1
2:10	1
Phrygia,	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Libya	1
about	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
strangers	1
of	1
Rome,	1
Jews	1
and	1
proselytes,	1
2:11	1
Cretes	1
and	1
Arabians,	1
we	1
do	1
hear	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
our	1
tongues	1
the	1
wonderful	1
works	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
doubt,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
this?	1
	1
2:13	1
Others	1
mocking	1
said,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
new	1
wine.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
Peter,	1
standing	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
eleven,	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
be	1
this	1
known	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
words:	1
2:15	1
For	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
drunken,	1
as	1
ye	1
suppose,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Joel;	1
2:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days,	1
saith	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions,	1
and	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams:	1
2:18	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
servants	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
handmaidens	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath;	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
vapour	1
of	1
smoke:	1
2:20	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
notable	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
come:	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:22	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
these	1
words;	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
a	1
man	1
approved	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs,	1
which	1
God	1
did	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
also	1
know:	1
2:23	1
Him,	1
being	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
determinate	1
counsel	1
and	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
taken,	1
and	1
by	1
wicked	1
hands	1
have	1
crucified	1
and	1
slain:	1
2:24	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
up,	1
having	1
loosed	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death:	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
holden	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
David	1
speaketh	1
concerning	1
him,	1
I	1
foresaw	1
the	1
Lord	1
always	1
before	1
my	1
face,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
did	1
my	1
heart	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
was	1
glad;	1
moreover	1
also	1
my	1
flesh	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
hope:	1
2:27	1
Because	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:28	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
life;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
with	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
2:29	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
let	1
me	1
freely	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
patriarch	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
both	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
and	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:30	1
Therefore	1
being	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
he	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
Christ	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne;	1
2:31	1
He	1
seeing	1
this	1
before	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
his	1
flesh	1
did	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
God	1
raised	1
up,	1
whereof	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
2:33	1
Therefore	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
exalted,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
forth	1
this,	1
which	1
ye	1
now	1
see	1
and	1
hear.	1
	1
2:34	1
For	1
David	1
is	1
not	1
ascended	1
into	1
the	1
heavens:	1
but	1
he	1
saith	1
himself,	1
The	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
2:35	1
Until	1
I	1
make	1
thy	1
foes	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
2:36	1
Therefore	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
know	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
crucified,	1
both	1
Lord	1
and	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:37	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
pricked	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
2:38	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Repent,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:39	1
For	1
the	1
promise	1
is	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
testify	1
and	1
exhort,	1
saying,	1
Save	1
yourselves	1
from	1
this	1
untoward	1
generation.	1
	1
2:41	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
gladly	1
received	1
his	1
word	1
were	1
baptized:	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
were	1
added	1
unto	1
them	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
souls.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
they	1
continued	1
stedfastly	1
in	1
the	1
apostles'	1
doctrine	1
and	1
fellowship,	1
and	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
prayers.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
every	1
soul:	1
and	1
many	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
together,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common;	1
2:45	1
And	1
sold	1
their	1
possessions	1
and	1
goods,	1
and	1
parted	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
they,	1
continuing	1
daily	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
breaking	1
bread	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
meat	1
with	1
gladness	1
and	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
2:47	1
Praising	1
God,	1
and	1
having	1
favour	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
daily	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
went	1
up	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
prayer,	1
being	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
lame	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb	1
was	1
carried,	1
whom	1
they	1
laid	1
daily	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Beautiful,	1
to	1
ask	1
alms	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
seeing	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
asked	1
an	1
alms.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Peter,	1
fastening	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
John,	1
said,	1
Look	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
them,	1
expecting	1
to	1
receive	1
something	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Silver	1
and	1
gold	1
have	1
I	1
none;	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
give	1
I	1
thee:	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up:	1
and	1
immediately	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
ankle	1
bones	1
received	1
strength.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
leaping	1
up	1
stood,	1
and	1
walked,	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
walking,	1
and	1
leaping,	1
and	1
praising	1
God.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
and	1
praising	1
God:	1
3:10	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
which	1
sat	1
for	1
alms	1
at	1
the	1
Beautiful	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
held	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Solomon's,	1
greatly	1
wondering.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
marvel	1
ye	1
at	1
this?	1
or	1
why	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
earnestly	1
on	1
us,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
power	1
or	1
holiness	1
we	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
walk?	1
3:13	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
hath	1
glorified	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus;	1
whom	1
ye	1
delivered	1
up,	1
and	1
denied	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
ye	1
denied	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
and	1
the	1
Just,	1
and	1
desired	1
a	1
murderer	1
to	1
be	1
granted	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:15	1
And	1
killed	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
life,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
whereof	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
hath	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
strong,	1
whom	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know:	1
yea,	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
him	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
this	1
perfect	1
soundness	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
through	1
ignorance	1
ye	1
did	1
it,	1
as	1
did	1
also	1
your	1
rulers.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
those	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
before	1
had	1
shewed	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets,	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
he	1
hath	1
so	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:19	1
Repent	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
that	1
your	1
sins	1
may	1
be	1
blotted	1
out,	1
when	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
refreshing	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
before	1
was	1
preached	1
unto	1
you:	1
3:21	1
Whom	1
the	1
heaven	1
must	1
receive	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
restitution	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began.	1
	1
3:22	1
For	1
Moses	1
truly	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
soul,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
prophet,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:24	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
from	1
Samuel	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
follow	1
after,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
spoken,	1
have	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
	1
3:25	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
God	1
made	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
saying	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:26	1
Unto	1
you	1
first	1
God,	1
having	1
raised	1
up	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
you,	1
in	1
turning	1
away	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
iniquities.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
grieved	1
that	1
they	1
taught	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
preached	1
through	1
Jesus	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
hold	1
unto	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
eventide.	1
	1
4:4	1
Howbeit	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
believed;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
4:6	1
And	1
Annas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
Caiaphas,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
they	1
asked,	1
By	1
what	1
power,	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
name,	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this?	1
	1
4:8	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
4:9	1
If	1
we	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
examined	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
deed	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
impotent	1
man,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
whole;	1
4:10	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
ye	1
crucified,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
by	1
him	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
stand	1
here	1
before	1
you	1
whole.	1
	1
4:11	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
of	1
you	1
builders,	1
which	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
4:12	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
salvation	1
in	1
any	1
other:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
name	1
under	1
heaven	1
given	1
among	1
men,	1
whereby	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
4:13	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
unlearned	1
and	1
ignorant	1
men,	1
they	1
marvelled;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
beholding	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
standing	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
they	1
conferred	1
among	1
themselves,	1
4:16	1
Saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
these	1
men?	1
for	1
that	1
indeed	1
a	1
notable	1
miracle	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
them	1
is	1
manifest	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
spread	1
no	1
further	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
let	1
us	1
straitly	1
threaten	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
henceforth	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all	1
nor	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
unto	1
God,	1
judge	1
ye.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
we	1
cannot	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
4:21	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
further	1
threatened	1
them,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
finding	1
nothing	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
punish	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
glorified	1
God	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
above	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
on	1
whom	1
this	1
miracle	1
of	1
healing	1
was	1
shewed.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
being	1
let	1
go,	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
company,	1
and	1
reported	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
God,	1
which	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is:	1
4:25	1
Who	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
hast	1
said,	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
heathen	1
rage,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
vain	1
things?	1
	1
4:26	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
against	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
anointed,	1
both	1
Herod,	1
and	1
Pontius	1
Pilate,	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
4:28	1
For	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
hand	1
and	1
thy	1
counsel	1
determined	1
before	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
now,	1
Lord,	1
behold	1
their	1
threatenings:	1
and	1
grant	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness	1
they	1
may	1
speak	1
thy	1
word,	1
4:30	1
By	1
stretching	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
heal;	1
and	1
that	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
shaken	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
together;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
boldness.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
heart	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
soul:	1
neither	1
said	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
was	1
his	1
own;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
gave	1
the	1
apostles	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
great	1
grace	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
4:34	1
Neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
lacked:	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
possessors	1
of	1
lands	1
or	1
houses	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
sold,	1
4:35	1
And	1
laid	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet:	1
and	1
distribution	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
Joses,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
apostles	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Barnabas,	1
(which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
consolation,)	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
4:37	1
Having	1
land,	1
sold	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias,	1
with	1
Sapphira	1
his	1
wife,	1
sold	1
a	1
possession,	1
5:2	1
And	1
kept	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price,	1
his	1
wife	1
also	1
being	1
privy	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
certain	1
part,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Ananias,	1
why	1
hath	1
Satan	1
filled	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
5:4	1
Whiles	1
it	1
remained,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
thine	1
own?	1
and	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
sold,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
power?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
conceived	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
thine	1
heart?	1
	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
lied	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Ananias	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
arose,	1
wound	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
after,	1
when	1
his	1
wife,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
unto	1
her,	1
Tell	1
me	1
whether	1
ye	1
sold	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
so	1
much?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Yea,	1
for	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
agreed	1
together	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
behold,	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
buried	1
thy	1
husband	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
out.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
fell	1
she	1
down	1
straightway	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
dead,	1
and,	1
carrying	1
her	1
forth,	1
buried	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
upon	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
were	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
(and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
durst	1
no	1
man	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
magnified	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
believers	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
multitudes	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women.)	1
	1
5:15	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
sick	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
beds	1
and	1
couches,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Peter	1
passing	1
by	1
might	1
overshadow	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
came	1
also	1
a	1
multitude	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
bringing	1
sick	1
folks,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed	1
every	1
one.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,)	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
indignation,	1
5:18	1
And	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
prison.	1
	1
5:19	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
night	1
opened	1
the	1
prison	1
doors,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
said,	1
5:20	1
Go,	1
stand	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
taught.	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
council	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
brought.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
officers	1
came,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
told,	1
5:23	1
Saying,	1
The	1
prison	1
truly	1
found	1
we	1
shut	1
with	1
all	1
safety,	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
standing	1
without	1
before	1
the	1
doors:	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
opened,	1
we	1
found	1
no	1
man	1
within.	1
	1
5:24	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
doubted	1
of	1
them	1
whereunto	1
this	1
would	1
grow.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
came	1
one	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
ye	1
put	1
in	1
prison	1
are	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
teaching	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
5:26	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
without	1
violence:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
stoned.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them,	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
council:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
them,	1
5:28	1
Saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
straitly	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
teach	1
in	1
this	1
name?	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
have	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
your	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
intend	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
man's	1
blood	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
apostles	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
obey	1
God	1
rather	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
5:30	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
5:31	1
Him	1
hath	1
God	1
exalted	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Prince	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
for	1
to	1
give	1
repentance	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
5:33	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
5:34	1
Then	1
stood	1
there	1
up	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
named	1
Gamaliel,	1
a	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
had	1
in	1
reputation	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
apostles	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
space;	1
5:35	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves	1
what	1
ye	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
touching	1
these	1
men.	1
	1
5:36	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
rose	1
up	1
Theudas,	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
somebody;	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
about	1
four	1
hundred,	1
joined	1
themselves:	1
who	1
was	1
slain;	1
and	1
all,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
scattered,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:37	1
After	1
this	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
Judas	1
of	1
Galilee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
taxing,	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
much	1
people	1
after	1
him:	1
he	1
also	1
perished;	1
and	1
all,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
dispersed.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Refrain	1
from	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
alone:	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
counsel	1
or	1
this	1
work	1
be	1
of	1
men,	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
5:39	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
overthrow	1
it;	1
lest	1
haply	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
agreed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
beaten	1
them,	1
they	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
worthy	1
to	1
suffer	1
shame	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
house,	1
they	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
preach	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
was	1
multiplied,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
Grecians	1
against	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
because	1
their	1
widows	1
were	1
neglected	1
in	1
the	1
daily	1
ministration.	1
	1
6:2	1
Then	1
the	1
twelve	1
called	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
tables.	1
	1
6:3	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
look	1
ye	1
out	1
among	1
you	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
honest	1
report,	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
this	1
business.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
ourselves	1
continually	1
to	1
prayer,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
chose	1
Stephen,	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Prochorus,	1
and	1
Nicanor,	1
and	1
Timon,	1
and	1
Parmenas,	1
and	1
Nicolas	1
a	1
proselyte	1
of	1
Antioch:	1
6:6	1
Whom	1
they	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
apostles:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
increased;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
greatly;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
Stephen,	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
power,	1
did	1
great	1
wonders	1
and	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Libertines,	1
and	1
Cyrenians,	1
and	1
Alexandrians,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
disputing	1
with	1
Stephen.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
they	1
suborned	1
men,	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
council,	1
6:13	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
this	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
law:	1
6:14	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
shall	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
change	1
the	1
customs	1
which	1
Moses	1
delivered	1
us.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
looking	1
stedfastly	1
on	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
angel.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
Are	1
these	1
things	1
so?	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hearken;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
glory	1
appeared	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
before	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran,	1
7:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldaeans,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran:	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
removed	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
now	1
dwell.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
none	1
inheritance	1
in	1
it,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on:	1
yet	1
he	1
promised	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him,	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
That	1
his	1
seed	1
should	1
sojourn	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage,	1
and	1
entreat	1
them	1
evil	1
four	1
hundred	1
years.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bondage	1
will	1
I	1
judge,	1
said	1
God:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
circumcision:	1
and	1
so	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
the	1
eighth	1
day;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
begat	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
begat	1
the	1
twelve	1
patriarchs.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
patriarchs,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
but	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
7:10	1
And	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
afflictions,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
and	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
governor	1
over	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:11	1
Now	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
dearth	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Chanaan,	1
and	1
great	1
affliction:	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
found	1
no	1
sustenance.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
our	1
fathers	1
first.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
Joseph	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
kindred	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
sent	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
father	1
Jacob	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kindred,	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
souls.	1
	1
7:15	1
So	1
Jacob	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
died,	1
he,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
7:16	1
And	1
were	1
carried	1
over	1
into	1
Sychem,	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
for	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Emmor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Sychem.	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
people	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
7:18	1
Till	1
another	1
king	1
arose,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
7:19	1
The	1
same	1
dealt	1
subtilly	1
with	1
our	1
kindred,	1
and	1
evil	1
entreated	1
our	1
fathers,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
their	1
young	1
children,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
which	1
time	1
Moses	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
was	1
exceeding	1
fair,	1
and	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
three	1
months:	1
7:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
nourished	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
son.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
learned	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
deeds.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
seeing	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suffer	1
wrong,	1
he	1
defended	1
him,	1
and	1
avenged	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptian:	1
7:25	1
For	1
he	1
supposed	1
his	1
brethren	1
would	1
have	1
understood	1
how	1
that	1
God	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
would	1
deliver	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
strove,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
one	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren;	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
wrong	1
one	1
to	1
another?	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
his	1
neighbour	1
wrong	1
thrust	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
7:28	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
diddest	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
yesterday?	1
	1
7:29	1
Then	1
fled	1
Moses	1
at	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Madian,	1
where	1
he	1
begat	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
forty	1
years	1
were	1
expired,	1
there	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mount	1
Sina	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
bush.	1
	1
7:31	1
When	1
Moses	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
sight:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
behold	1
it,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
7:32	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Then	1
Moses	1
trembled,	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
behold.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
him,	1
Put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
7:34	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
Moses	1
whom	1
they	1
refused,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge?	1
the	1
same	1
did	1
God	1
send	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
deliverer	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bush.	1
	1
7:36	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
Moses,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear.	1
	1
7:38	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Sina,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
fathers:	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
lively	1
oracles	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
us:	1
7:39	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
not	1
obey,	1
but	1
thrust	1
him	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
7:40	1
Saying	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
which	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:41	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
calf	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
idol,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
7:42	1
Then	1
God	1
turned,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
ye	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
slain	1
beasts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
7:43	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Moloch,	1
and	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god	1
Remphan,	1
figures	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
worship	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
you	1
away	1
beyond	1
Babylon.	1
	1
7:44	1
Our	1
fathers	1
had	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appointed,	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fashion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
7:45	1
Which	1
also	1
our	1
fathers	1
that	1
came	1
after	1
brought	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whom	1
God	1
drave	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David;	1
7:46	1
Who	1
found	1
favour	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
7:47	1
But	1
Solomon	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:48	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
as	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet,	1
7:49	1
Heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
what	1
house	1
will	1
ye	1
build	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord:	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
7:50	1
Hath	1
not	1
my	1
hand	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
7:51	1
Ye	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
ears,	1
ye	1
do	1
always	1
resist	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did,	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:52	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
not	1
your	1
fathers	1
persecuted?	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
which	1
shewed	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Just	1
One;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
the	1
betrayers	1
and	1
murderers:	1
7:53	1
Who	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
it.	1
	1
7:54	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
they	1
gnashed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
7:55	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
looked	1
up	1
stedfastly	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
7:56	1
And	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:57	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
ran	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
7:58	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
witnesses	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
clothes	1
at	1
a	1
young	1
man's	1
feet,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul.	1
	1
7:59	1
And	1
they	1
stoned	1
Stephen,	1
calling	1
upon	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
receive	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
7:60	1
And	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lord,	1
lay	1
not	1
this	1
sin	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
persecution	1
against	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
except	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
devout	1
men	1
carried	1
Stephen	1
to	1
his	1
burial,	1
and	1
made	1
great	1
lamentation	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
8:3	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
made	1
havock	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
entering	1
into	1
every	1
house,	1
and	1
haling	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
committed	1
them	1
to	1
prison.	1
	1
8:4	1
Therefore	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
went	1
every	1
where	1
preaching	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
8:5	1
Then	1
Philip	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
preached	1
Christ	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Philip	1
spake,	1
hearing	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
crying	1
with	1
loud	1
voice,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
many	1
taken	1
with	1
palsies,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
called	1
Simon,	1
which	1
beforetime	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
city	1
used	1
sorcery,	1
and	1
bewitched	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
giving	1
out	1
that	1
himself	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
one:	1
8:10	1
To	1
whom	1
they	1
all	1
gave	1
heed,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
regard,	1
because	1
that	1
of	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
bewitched	1
them	1
with	1
sorceries.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
believed	1
Philip	1
preaching	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
Simon	1
himself	1
believed	1
also:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
Philip,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
beholding	1
the	1
miracles	1
and	1
signs	1
which	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
apostles	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
heard	1
that	1
Samaria	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
Peter	1
and	1
John:	1
8:15	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down,	1
prayed	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
8:16	1
(For	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
none	1
of	1
them:	1
only	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.)	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
laid	1
they	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
when	1
Simon	1
saw	1
that	1
through	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
apostles'	1
hands	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
given,	1
he	1
offered	1
them	1
money,	1
8:19	1
Saying,	1
Give	1
me	1
also	1
this	1
power,	1
that	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
lay	1
hands,	1
he	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:20	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
money	1
perish	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
purchased	1
with	1
money.	1
	1
8:21	1
Thou	1
hast	1
neither	1
part	1
nor	1
lot	1
in	1
this	1
matter:	1
for	1
thy	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
Repent	1
therefore	1
of	1
this	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
pray	1
God,	1
if	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
8:23	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
8:24	1
Then	1
answered	1
Simon,	1
and	1
said,	1
Pray	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
come	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
testified	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
many	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
is	1
desert.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
an	1
eunuch	1
of	1
great	1
authority	1
under	1
Candace	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
treasure,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship,	1
8:28	1
Was	1
returning,	1
and	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
read	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
8:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
join	1
thyself	1
to	1
this	1
chariot.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Philip	1
ran	1
thither	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
read	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
and	1
said,	1
Understandest	1
thou	1
what	1
thou	1
readest?	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I,	1
except	1
some	1
man	1
should	1
guide	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
Philip	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:32	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
which	1
he	1
read	1
was	1
this,	1
He	1
was	1
led	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
dumb	1
before	1
his	1
shearer,	1
so	1
opened	1
he	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
8:33	1
In	1
his	1
humiliation	1
his	1
judgment	1
was	1
taken	1
away:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
eunuch	1
answered	1
Philip,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
whom	1
speaketh	1
the	1
prophet	1
this?	1
of	1
himself,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
man?	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
Philip	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
scripture,	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
him	1
Jesus.	1
	1
8:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch	1
said,	1
See,	1
here	1
is	1
water;	1
what	1
doth	1
hinder	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
baptized?	1
	1
8:37	1
And	1
Philip	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
believest	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
thou	1
mayest.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:38	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
stand	1
still:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
both	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
both	1
Philip	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch;	1
and	1
he	1
baptized	1
him.	1
	1
8:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
caught	1
away	1
Philip,	1
that	1
the	1
eunuch	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
Philip	1
was	1
found	1
at	1
Azotus:	1
and	1
passing	1
through	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Saul,	1
yet	1
breathing	1
out	1
threatenings	1
and	1
slaughter	1
against	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
9:2	1
And	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
Damascus	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
way,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
or	1
women,	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shined	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven:	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest:	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
trembling	1
and	1
astonished	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
him	1
stood	1
speechless,	1
hearing	1
a	1
voice,	1
but	1
seeing	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
without	1
sight,	1
and	1
neither	1
did	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
named	1
Ananias;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
Ananias.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Straight,	1
and	1
enquire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judas	1
for	1
one	1
called	1
Saul,	1
of	1
Tarsus:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prayeth,	1
9:12	1
And	1
hath	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
Ananias	1
answered,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
how	1
much	1
evil	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
thy	1
saints	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
9:14	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
hath	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
to	1
bind	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
vessel	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
name	1
before	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
Ananias	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
said,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
thou	1
camest,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
scales:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
sight	1
forthwith,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
meat,	1
he	1
was	1
strengthened.	1
Then	1
was	1
Saul	1
certain	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
disciples	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
preached	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said;	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
them	1
which	1
called	1
on	1
this	1
name	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
came	1
hither	1
for	1
that	1
intent,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests?	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Saul	1
increased	1
the	1
more	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
confounded	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
proving	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
many	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
kill	1
him:	1
9:24	1
But	1
their	1
laying	1
await	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
Saul.	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
the	1
gates	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
a	1
basket.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
disciples:	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
believed	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disciple.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
preached	1
boldly	1
at	1
Damascus	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
disputed	1
against	1
the	1
Grecians:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
9:30	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
knew,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
Tarsus.	1
	1
9:31	1
Then	1
had	1
the	1
churches	1
rest	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Galilee	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
were	1
edified;	1
and	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
were	1
multiplied.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Peter	1
passed	1
throughout	1
all	1
quarters,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Aeneas,	1
which	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
bed	1
eight	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Aeneas,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
maketh	1
thee	1
whole:	1
arise,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
bed.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
immediately.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda	1
and	1
Saron	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:36	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
Joppa	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
named	1
Tabitha,	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
called	1
Dorcas:	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
works	1
and	1
almsdeeds	1
which	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
died:	1
whom	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
washed,	1
they	1
laid	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
upper	1
chamber.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
Lydda	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Peter	1
was	1
there,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
Then	1
Peter	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
widows	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
coats	1
and	1
garments	1
which	1
Dorcas	1
made,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:40	1
But	1
Peter	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
forth,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed;	1
and	1
turning	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
said,	1
Tabitha,	1
arise.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter,	1
she	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
widows,	1
presented	1
her	1
alive.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
throughout	1
all	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
Joppa	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner.	1
	1
10:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
in	1
Caesarea	1
called	1
Cornelius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
called	1
the	1
Italian	1
band,	1
10:2	1
A	1
devout	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feared	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
gave	1
much	1
alms	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
alway.	1
	1
10:3	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
evidently	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
coming	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cornelius.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
Lord?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
prayers	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
come	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
now	1
send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
one	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter:	1
10:6	1
He	1
lodgeth	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner,	1
whose	1
house	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
Cornelius	1
was	1
departed,	1
he	1
called	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
household	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
devout	1
soldier	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
continually;	1
10:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Joppa.	1
	1
10:9	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
Peter	1
went	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
hungry,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
eaten:	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
made	1
ready,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
10:11	1
And	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descending	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
four	1
corners,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
10:12	1
Wherein	1
were	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
Peter;	1
kill,	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
eaten	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
10:16	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
thrice:	1
and	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
while	1
Peter	1
doubted	1
in	1
himself	1
what	1
this	1
vision	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
should	1
mean,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Cornelius	1
had	1
made	1
enquiry	1
for	1
Simon's	1
house,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate,	1
10:18	1
And	1
called,	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
Simon,	1
which	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Peter,	1
were	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
While	1
Peter	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
vision,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
three	1
men	1
seek	1
thee.	1
	1
10:20	1
Arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
doubting	1
nothing:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
them.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Peter	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
Cornelius;	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
come?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Cornelius	1
the	1
centurion,	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
report	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
warned	1
from	1
God	1
by	1
an	1
holy	1
angel	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
thee	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
words	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
10:23	1
Then	1
called	1
he	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
lodged	1
them.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Peter	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
from	1
Joppa	1
accompanied	1
him.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
Caesarea.	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
waited	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
his	1
kinsmen	1
and	1
near	1
friends.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
coming	1
in,	1
Cornelius	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
Peter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Stand	1
up;	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unlawful	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
nation;	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
any	1
man	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:29	1
Therefore	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
without	1
gainsaying,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
for:	1
I	1
ask	1
therefore	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
said,	1
Four	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
fasting	1
until	1
this	1
hour;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
bright	1
clothing,	1
10:31	1
And	1
said,	1
Cornelius,	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard,	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
had	1
in	1
remembrance	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Send	1
therefore	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
hither	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
he	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
Immediately	1
therefore	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
done	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
here	1
present	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
commanded	1
thee	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Then	1
Peter	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
no	1
respecter	1
of	1
persons:	1
10:35	1
But	1
in	1
every	1
nation	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
him,	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
is	1
accepted	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:36	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
God	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
preaching	1
peace	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
(he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
all:)	1
10:37	1
That	1
word,	1
I	1
say,	1
ye	1
know,	1
which	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
began	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
after	1
the	1
baptism	1
which	1
John	1
preached;	1
10:38	1
How	1
God	1
anointed	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
power:	1
who	1
went	1
about	1
doing	1
good,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
oppressed	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
whom	1
they	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
10:40	1
Him	1
God	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
openly;	1
10:41	1
Not	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
but	1
unto	1
witnesses	1
chosen	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
quick	1
and	1
dead.	1
	1
10:43	1
To	1
him	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
witness,	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
name	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
receive	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:44	1
While	1
Peter	1
yet	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
10:45	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
which	1
believed	1
were	1
astonished,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
with	1
Peter,	1
because	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
10:46	1
For	1
they	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
magnify	1
God.	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
10:47	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
forbid	1
water,	1
that	1
these	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
baptized,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we?	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Then	1
prayed	1
they	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Judaea	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
had	1
also	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
contended	1
with	1
him,	1
11:3	1
Saying,	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
in	1
to	1
men	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
didst	1
eat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
Peter	1
rehearsed	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
expounded	1
it	1
by	1
order	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
11:5	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Joppa	1
praying:	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
vision,	1
A	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descend,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet,	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
four	1
corners;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
me:	1
11:6	1
Upon	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fastened	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
I	1
considered,	1
and	1
saw	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
Peter;	1
slay	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord:	1
for	1
nothing	1
common	1
or	1
unclean	1
hath	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
the	1
voice	1
answered	1
me	1
again	1
from	1
heaven,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
immediately	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
men	1
already	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
sent	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
nothing	1
doubting.	1
Moreover	1
these	1
six	1
brethren	1
accompanied	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
man's	1
house:	1
11:13	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
us	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
stood	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
11:14	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
words,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
on	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
remembered	1
I	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
John	1
indeed	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
11:17	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
like	1
gift	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us,	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
what	1
was	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
withstand	1
God?	1
	1
11:18	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Then	1
hath	1
God	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
granted	1
repentance	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
11:19	1
Now	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
persecution	1
that	1
arose	1
about	1
Stephen	1
travelled	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
Cyprus,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
only.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
Cyprus	1
and	1
Cyrene,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
preaching	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
believed,	1
and	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
tidings	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
Barnabas,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
exhorted	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
with	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
they	1
would	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
of	1
faith:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
departed	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Tarsus,	1
for	1
to	1
seek	1
Saul:	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
taught	1
much	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
called	1
Christians	1
first	1
in	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
came	1
prophets	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
named	1
Agabus,	1
and	1
signified	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
great	1
dearth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
world:	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Claudius	1
Caesar.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability,	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
relief	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Judaea:	1
11:30	1
Which	1
also	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
elders	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
about	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
vex	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
James	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
John	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
further	1
to	1
take	1
Peter	1
also.	1
(Then	1
were	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
apprehended	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
four	1
quaternions	1
of	1
soldiers	1
to	1
keep	1
him;	1
intending	1
after	1
Easter	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
12:5	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
prison:	1
but	1
prayer	1
was	1
made	1
without	1
ceasing	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
Peter	1
was	1
sleeping	1
between	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains:	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
kept	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
12:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
shined	1
in	1
the	1
prison:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
Peter	1
on	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Arise	1
up	1
quickly.	1
And	1
his	1
chains	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
bind	1
on	1
thy	1
sandals.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cast	1
thy	1
garment	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
which	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
angel;	1
but	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
vision.	1
	1
12:10	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
ward,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
iron	1
gate	1
that	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
the	1
city;	1
which	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
through	1
one	1
street;	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Herod,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
considered	1
the	1
thing,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark;	1
where	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
praying.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
to	1
hearken,	1
named	1
Rhoda.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
Peter's	1
voice,	1
she	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
gladness,	1
but	1
ran	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
how	1
Peter	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
mad.	1
But	1
she	1
constantly	1
affirmed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
so.	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
It	1
is	1
his	1
angel.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
continued	1
knocking:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
he,	1
beckoning	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
shew	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
James,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
brethren.	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
another	1
place.	1
	1
12:18	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
what	1
was	1
become	1
of	1
Peter.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
had	1
sought	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
keepers,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
there	1
abode.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Herod	1
was	1
highly	1
displeased	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon:	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
made	1
Blastus	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain	1
their	1
friend,	1
desired	1
peace;	1
because	1
their	1
country	1
was	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
country.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
upon	1
a	1
set	1
day	1
Herod,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
royal	1
apparel,	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
oration	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gave	1
a	1
shout,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
gave	1
not	1
God	1
the	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eaten	1
of	1
worms,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
their	1
ministry,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Antioch	1
certain	1
prophets	1
and	1
teachers;	1
as	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Niger,	1
and	1
Lucius	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
Manaen,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
13:2	1
As	1
they	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
said,	1
Separate	1
me	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
whereunto	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
they	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
13:4	1
So	1
they,	1
being	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
departed	1
unto	1
Seleucia;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
sailed	1
to	1
Cyprus.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
Salamis,	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
John	1
to	1
their	1
minister.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
isle	1
unto	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
sorcerer,	1
a	1
false	1
prophet,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Barjesus:	1
13:7	1
Which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
Sergius	1
Paulus,	1
a	1
prudent	1
man;	1
who	1
called	1
for	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:8	1
But	1
Elymas	1
the	1
sorcerer	1
(for	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
by	1
interpretation)	1
withstood	1
them,	1
seeking	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
deputy	1
from	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
13:9	1
Then	1
Saul,	1
(who	1
also	1
is	1
called	1
Paul,)	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
set	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
subtilty	1
and	1
all	1
mischief,	1
thou	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
thou	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blind,	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
mist	1
and	1
a	1
darkness;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
seeking	1
some	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
13:12	1
Then	1
the	1
deputy,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
believed,	1
being	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:13	1
Now	1
when	1
Paul	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
loosed	1
from	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Perga	1
in	1
Pamphylia:	1
and	1
John	1
departing	1
from	1
them	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Perga,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch	1
in	1
Pisidia,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
sent	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
13:16	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
beckoning	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
said,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
give	1
audience.	1
	1
13:17	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
chose	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
exalted	1
the	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
dwelt	1
as	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
arm	1
brought	1
he	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
suffered	1
he	1
their	1
manners	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
seven	1
nations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chanaan,	1
he	1
divided	1
their	1
land	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
lot.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
judges	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years,	1
until	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
afterward	1
they	1
desired	1
a	1
king:	1
and	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cis,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king;	1
to	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
testimony,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
fulfil	1
all	1
my	1
will.	1
	1
13:23	1
Of	1
this	1
man's	1
seed	1
hath	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise	1
raised	1
unto	1
Israel	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
Jesus:	1
13:24	1
When	1
John	1
had	1
first	1
preached	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
as	1
John	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
course,	1
he	1
said,	1
Whom	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
he.	1
But,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
after	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
loose.	1
	1
13:26	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
among	1
you	1
feareth	1
God,	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
this	1
salvation	1
sent.	1
	1
13:27	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
their	1
rulers,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
are	1
read	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
they	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
them	1
in	1
condemning	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him,	1
yet	1
desired	1
they	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
13:30	1
But	1
God	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
13:31	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
many	1
days	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
we	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
glad	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
13:33	1
God	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
same	1
unto	1
us	1
their	1
children,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
again;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
13:34	1
And	1
as	1
concerning	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
now	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
corruption,	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
13:35	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:36	1
For	1
David,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
his	1
own	1
generation	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
fell	1
on	1
sleep,	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
unto	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
saw	1
corruption:	1
13:37	1
But	1
he,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
again,	1
saw	1
no	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:38	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore,	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
that	1
through	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
13:39	1
And	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
are	1
justified	1
from	1
all	1
things,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
13:40	1
Beware	1
therefore,	1
lest	1
that	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
prophets;	1
13:41	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
despisers,	1
and	1
wonder,	1
and	1
perish:	1
for	1
I	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
believe,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
13:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
besought	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
preached	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:43	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
religious	1
proselytes	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas:	1
who,	1
speaking	1
to	1
them,	1
persuaded	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:44	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath	1
day	1
came	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:45	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
envy,	1
and	1
spake	1
against	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul,	1
contradicting	1
and	1
blaspheming.	1
	1
13:46	1
Then	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
waxed	1
bold,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
first	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
to	1
you:	1
but	1
seeing	1
ye	1
put	1
it	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
judge	1
yourselves	1
unworthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
lo,	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
13:47	1
For	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
us,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
for	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
13:48	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
glorified	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
ordained	1
to	1
eternal	1
life	1
believed.	1
	1
13:49	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region.	1
	1
13:50	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
devout	1
and	1
honourable	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
raised	1
persecution	1
against	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
expelled	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
13:51	1
But	1
they	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Iconium.	1
	1
13:52	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Iconium,	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
so	1
spake,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks	1
believed.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
minds	1
evil	1
affected	1
against	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
14:3	1
Long	1
time	1
therefore	1
abode	1
they	1
speaking	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
which	1
gave	1
testimony	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
and	1
granted	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
divided:	1
and	1
part	1
held	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
assault	1
made	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
with	1
their	1
rulers,	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
despitefully,	1
and	1
to	1
stone	1
them,	1
14:6	1
They	1
were	1
ware	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
fled	1
unto	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Derbe,	1
cities	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
region	1
that	1
lieth	1
round	1
about:	1
14:7	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
at	1
Lystra,	1
impotent	1
in	1
his	1
feet,	1
being	1
a	1
cripple	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
walked:	1
14:9	1
The	1
same	1
heard	1
Paul	1
speak:	1
who	1
stedfastly	1
beholding	1
him,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
faith	1
to	1
be	1
healed,	1
14:10	1
Said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Stand	1
upright	1
on	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
he	1
leaped	1
and	1
walked.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
what	1
Paul	1
had	1
done,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
The	1
gods	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Barnabas,	1
Jupiter;	1
and	1
Paul,	1
Mercurius,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
speaker.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
their	1
city,	1
brought	1
oxen	1
and	1
garlands	1
unto	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:14	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
heard	1
of,	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
crying	1
out,	1
14:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
these	1
things?	1
We	1
also	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
like	1
passions	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
turn	1
from	1
these	1
vanities	1
unto	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
which	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
therein:	1
14:16	1
Who	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
suffered	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
ways.	1
	1
14:17	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
left	1
not	1
himself	1
without	1
witness,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fruitful	1
seasons,	1
filling	1
our	1
hearts	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
sayings	1
scarce	1
restrained	1
they	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
thither	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Iconium,	1
who	1
persuaded	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
having	1
stoned	1
Paul,	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
supposing	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dead.	1
	1
14:20	1
Howbeit,	1
as	1
the	1
disciples	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
departed	1
with	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Derbe.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
had	1
taught	1
many,	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
Lystra,	1
and	1
to	1
Iconium,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
14:22	1
Confirming	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
exhorting	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
through	1
much	1
tribulation	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
ordained	1
them	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
church,	1
and	1
had	1
prayed	1
with	1
fasting,	1
they	1
commended	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
believed.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
throughout	1
Pisidia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Pamphylia.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Perga,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Attalia:	1
14:26	1
And	1
thence	1
sailed	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
church	1
together,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
abode	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
certain	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
taught	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
15:2	1
When	1
therefore	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
had	1
no	1
small	1
dissension	1
and	1
disputation	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
determined	1
that	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
about	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
being	1
brought	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
church,	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
Phenice	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
declaring	1
the	1
conversion	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
great	1
joy	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
were	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
they	1
declared	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
believed,	1
saying,	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
to	1
circumcise	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
came	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
disputing,	1
Peter	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
ago	1
God	1
made	1
choice	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
my	1
mouth	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
believe.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
God,	1
which	1
knoweth	1
the	1
hearts,	1
bare	1
them	1
witness,	1
giving	1
them	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us;	1
15:9	1
And	1
put	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
them,	1
purifying	1
their	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
15:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
God,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
which	1
neither	1
our	1
fathers	1
nor	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
bear?	1
15:11	1
But	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
even	1
as	1
they.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
kept	1
silence,	1
and	1
gave	1
audience	1
to	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
declaring	1
what	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
James	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:14	1
Simeon	1
hath	1
declared	1
how	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
did	1
visit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
to	1
this	1
agree	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
15:16	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
fallen	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
ruins	1
thereof,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
it	1
up:	1
15:17	1
That	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
men	1
might	1
seek	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
upon	1
whom	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
called,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
doeth	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:18	1
Known	1
unto	1
God	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
sentence	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
trouble	1
not	1
them,	1
which	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
turned	1
to	1
God:	1
15:20	1
But	1
that	1
we	1
write	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
abstain	1
from	1
pollutions	1
of	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
blood.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
Moses	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
hath	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
him,	1
being	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:22	1
Then	1
pleased	1
it	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
company	1
to	1
Antioch	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas;	1
namely,	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Barsabas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
chief	1
men	1
among	1
the	1
brethren:	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
wrote	1
letters	1
by	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
The	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
and	1
brethren	1
send	1
greeting	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia.	1
	1
15:24	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
that	1
certain	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us	1
have	1
troubled	1
you	1
with	1
words,	1
subverting	1
your	1
souls,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
no	1
such	1
commandment:	1
15:25	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
being	1
assembled	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
our	1
beloved	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
15:26	1
Men	1
that	1
have	1
hazarded	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:27	1
We	1
have	1
sent	1
therefore	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
who	1
shall	1
also	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
by	1
mouth.	1
	1
15:28	1
For	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
lay	1
upon	1
you	1
no	1
greater	1
burden	1
than	1
these	1
necessary	1
things;	1
15:29	1
That	1
ye	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication:	1
from	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
yourselves,	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
Fare	1
ye	1
well.	1
	1
15:30	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
multitude	1
together,	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle:	1
15:31	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
being	1
prophets	1
also	1
themselves,	1
exhorted	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
many	1
words,	1
and	1
confirmed	1
them.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
tarried	1
there	1
a	1
space,	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
go	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:34	1
Notwithstanding	1
it	1
pleased	1
Silas	1
to	1
abide	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
15:35	1
Paul	1
also	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
continued	1
in	1
Antioch,	1
teaching	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
some	1
days	1
after	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
Barnabas,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
again	1
and	1
visit	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
15:38	1
But	1
Paul	1
thought	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
who	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
from	1
Pamphylia,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
the	1
contention	1
was	1
so	1
sharp	1
between	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
asunder	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other:	1
and	1
so	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
Mark,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Cyprus;	1
15:40	1
And	1
Paul	1
chose	1
Silas,	1
and	1
departed,	1
being	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia,	1
confirming	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
to	1
Derbe	1
and	1
Lystra:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
was	1
there,	1
named	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
and	1
believed;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek:	1
16:2	1
Which	1
was	1
well	1
reported	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Iconium.	1
	1
16:3	1
Him	1
would	1
Paul	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
took	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
those	1
quarters:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities,	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
the	1
decrees	1
for	1
to	1
keep,	1
that	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
churches	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
number	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
throughout	1
Phrygia	1
and	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
and	1
were	1
forbidden	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Asia,	1
16:7	1
After	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Mysia,	1
they	1
assayed	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Bithynia:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
suffered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
passing	1
by	1
Mysia	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Troas.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
There	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
over	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
immediately	1
we	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
assuredly	1
gathering	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
called	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
16:11	1
Therefore	1
loosing	1
from	1
Troas,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
Samothracia,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Neapolis;	1
16:12	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Philippi,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
city	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
a	1
colony:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
abiding	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
river	1
side,	1
where	1
prayer	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
women	1
which	1
resorted	1
thither.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Lydia,	1
a	1
seller	1
of	1
purple,	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Thyatira,	1
which	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
heard	1
us:	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
Lord	1
opened,	1
that	1
she	1
attended	1
unto	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
baptized,	1
and	1
her	1
household,	1
she	1
besought	1
us,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
judged	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
abide	1
there.	1
And	1
she	1
constrained	1
us.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
prayer,	1
a	1
certain	1
damsel	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
divination	1
met	1
us,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
masters	1
much	1
gain	1
by	1
soothsaying:	1
16:17	1
The	1
same	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
us,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
shew	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
this	1
did	1
she	1
many	1
days.	1
But	1
Paul,	1
being	1
grieved,	1
turned	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
spirit,	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
hour.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
masters	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
their	1
gains	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
caught	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
marketplace	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers,	1
16:20	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
magistrates,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men,	1
being	1
Jews,	1
do	1
exceedingly	1
trouble	1
our	1
city,	1
16:21	1
And	1
teach	1
customs,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
receive,	1
neither	1
to	1
observe,	1
being	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rose	1
up	1
together	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
magistrates	1
rent	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
beat	1
them.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
many	1
stripes	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison,	1
charging	1
the	1
jailor	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
safely:	1
16:24	1
Who,	1
having	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
charge,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
prison,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
feet	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
prayed,	1
and	1
sang	1
praises	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
shaken:	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
every	1
one's	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
awaking	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
prison	1
doors	1
open,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
himself,	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
fled.	1
	1
16:28	1
But	1
Paul	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
thyself	1
no	1
harm:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here.	1
	1
16:29	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
16:30	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
what	1
must	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Believe	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
washed	1
their	1
stripes;	1
and	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his,	1
straightway.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
rejoiced,	1
believing	1
in	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
magistrates	1
sent	1
the	1
serjeants,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
those	1
men	1
go.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
told	1
this	1
saying	1
to	1
Paul,	1
The	1
magistrates	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go:	1
now	1
therefore	1
depart,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
16:37	1
But	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
beaten	1
us	1
openly	1
uncondemned,	1
being	1
Romans,	1
and	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
into	1
prison;	1
and	1
now	1
do	1
they	1
thrust	1
us	1
out	1
privily?	1
nay	1
verily;	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
themselves	1
and	1
fetch	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
16:38	1
And	1
the	1
serjeants	1
told	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
magistrates:	1
and	1
they	1
feared,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
desired	1
them	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
16:40	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Lydia:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
brethren,	1
they	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Amphipolis	1
and	1
Apollonia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Thessalonica,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
17:2	1
And	1
Paul,	1
as	1
his	1
manner	1
was,	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
three	1
sabbath	1
days	1
reasoned	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
17:3	1
Opening	1
and	1
alleging,	1
that	1
Christ	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
suffered,	1
and	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
I	1
preach	1
unto	1
you,	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
believed,	1
and	1
consorted	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
devout	1
Greeks	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
women	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:5	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
not,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
took	1
unto	1
them	1
certain	1
lewd	1
fellows	1
of	1
the	1
baser	1
sort,	1
and	1
gathered	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
assaulted	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not,	1
they	1
drew	1
Jason	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
crying,	1
These	1
that	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
world	1
upside	1
down	1
are	1
come	1
hither	1
also;	1
17:7	1
Whom	1
Jason	1
hath	1
received:	1
and	1
these	1
all	1
do	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
king,	1
one	1
Jesus.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
they	1
troubled	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
security	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
brethren	1
immediately	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
by	1
night	1
unto	1
Berea:	1
who	1
coming	1
thither	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
17:11	1
These	1
were	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
those	1
in	1
Thessalonica,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
all	1
readiness	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
daily,	1
whether	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
believed;	1
also	1
of	1
honourable	1
women	1
which	1
were	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
of	1
men,	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:13	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
Thessalonica	1
had	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
Paul	1
at	1
Berea,	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
also,	1
and	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
then	1
immediately	1
the	1
brethren	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
but	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
abode	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
conducted	1
Paul	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Athens:	1
and	1
receiving	1
a	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
for	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
speed,	1
they	1
departed.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
while	1
Paul	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Athens,	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
stirred	1
in	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
city	1
wholly	1
given	1
to	1
idolatry.	1
	1
17:17	1
Therefore	1
disputed	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
devout	1
persons,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
daily	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
met	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:18	1
Then	1
certain	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1
Epicureans,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Stoicks,	1
encountered	1
him.	1
And	1
some	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
this	1
babbler	1
say?	1
other	1
some,	1
He	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
setter	1
forth	1
of	1
strange	1
gods:	1
because	1
he	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Areopagus,	1
saying,	1
May	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine,	1
whereof	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
is?	1
	1
17:20	1
For	1
thou	1
bringest	1
certain	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
our	1
ears:	1
we	1
would	1
know	1
therefore	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean.	1
	1
17:21	1
(For	1
all	1
the	1
Athenians	1
and	1
strangers	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
nothing	1
else,	1
but	1
either	1
to	1
tell,	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
new	1
thing.)	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Mars'	1
hill,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Athens,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
are	1
too	1
superstitious.	1
	1
17:23	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
beheld	1
your	1
devotions,	1
I	1
found	1
an	1
altar	1
with	1
this	1
inscription,	1
TO	1
THE	1
UNKNOWN	1
GOD.	1
Whom	1
therefore	1
ye	1
ignorantly	1
worship,	1
him	1
declare	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:24	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
therein,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
17:25	1
Neither	1
is	1
worshipped	1
with	1
men's	1
hands,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
needed	1
any	1
thing,	1
seeing	1
he	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
breath,	1
and	1
all	1
things;	1
17:26	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
blood	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
determined	1
the	1
times	1
before	1
appointed,	1
and	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
their	1
habitation;	1
17:27	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
Lord,	1
if	1
haply	1
they	1
might	1
feel	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us:	1
17:28	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
live,	1
and	1
move,	1
and	1
have	1
our	1
being;	1
as	1
certain	1
also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
poets	1
have	1
said,	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
also	1
his	1
offspring.	1
	1
17:29	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Godhead	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
gold,	1
or	1
silver,	1
or	1
stone,	1
graven	1
by	1
art	1
and	1
man's	1
device.	1
	1
17:30	1
And	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
this	1
ignorance	1
God	1
winked	1
at;	1
but	1
now	1
commandeth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
to	1
repent:	1
17:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
a	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
righteousness	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
ordained;	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
assurance	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
some	1
mocked:	1
and	1
others	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
hear	1
thee	1
again	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
17:33	1
So	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
17:34	1
Howbeit	1
certain	1
men	1
clave	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
believed:	1
among	1
the	1
which	1
was	1
Dionysius	1
the	1
Areopagite,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
named	1
Damaris,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
Athens,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Corinth;	1
18:2	1
And	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Aquila,	1
born	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
lately	1
come	1
from	1
Italy,	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Priscilla;	1
(because	1
that	1
Claudius	1
had	1
commanded	1
all	1
Jews	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
Rome:)	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
craft,	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
wrought:	1
for	1
by	1
their	1
occupation	1
they	1
were	1
tentmakers.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
reasoned	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
every	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
when	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul	1
was	1
pressed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
blasphemed,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Your	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
heads;	1
I	1
am	1
clean;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
man's	1
house,	1
named	1
Justus,	1
one	1
that	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
whose	1
house	1
joined	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Crispus,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
hearing	1
believed,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
18:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
vision,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
but	1
speak,	1
and	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace:	1
18:10	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
set	1
on	1
thee	1
to	1
hurt	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
he	1
continued	1
there	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
when	1
Gallio	1
was	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
Jews	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
18:13	1
Saying,	1
This	1
fellow	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Gallio	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
wrong	1
or	1
wicked	1
lewdness,	1
O	1
ye	1
Jews,	1
reason	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
with	1
you:	1
18:15	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
names,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
law,	1
look	1
ye	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
he	1
drave	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Greeks	1
took	1
Sosthenes,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
beat	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
And	1
Gallio	1
cared	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
Paul	1
after	1
this	1
tarried	1
there	1
yet	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sailed	1
thence	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila;	1
having	1
shorn	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Cenchrea:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vow.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
there:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
reasoned	1
with	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
18:20	1
When	1
they	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
longer	1
time	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
consented	1
not;	1
18:21	1
But	1
bade	1
them	1
farewell,	1
saying,	1
I	1
must	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
keep	1
this	1
feast	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
God	1
will.	1
And	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
gone	1
up,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
church,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Antioch.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
there,	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Galatia	1
and	1
Phrygia	1
in	1
order,	1
strengthening	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Apollos,	1
born	1
at	1
Alexandria,	1
an	1
eloquent	1
man,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:25	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
instructed	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
being	1
fervent	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
taught	1
diligently	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
knowing	1
only	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
whom	1
when	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
had	1
heard,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
expounded	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
brethren	1
wrote,	1
exhorting	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
receive	1
him:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
helped	1
them	1
much	1
which	1
had	1
believed	1
through	1
grace:	1
18:28	1
For	1
he	1
mightily	1
convinced	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
that	1
publickly,	1
shewing	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
Apollos	1
was	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
Paul	1
having	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
coasts	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus:	1
and	1
finding	1
certain	1
disciples,	1
19:2	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
since	1
ye	1
believed?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
heard	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
what	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Unto	1
John's	1
baptism.	1
	1
19:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
John	1
verily	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance,	1
saying	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
after	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:5	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
came	1
on	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
about	1
twelve.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
spake	1
boldly	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
months,	1
disputing	1
and	1
persuading	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:9	1
But	1
when	1
divers	1
were	1
hardened,	1
and	1
believed	1
not,	1
but	1
spake	1
evil	1
of	1
that	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
separated	1
the	1
disciples,	1
disputing	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
one	1
Tyrannus.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
this	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Asia	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
God	1
wrought	1
special	1
miracles	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Paul:	1
19:12	1
So	1
that	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
handkerchiefs	1
or	1
aprons,	1
and	1
the	1
diseases	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
vagabond	1
Jews,	1
exorcists,	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
evil	1
spirits	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
We	1
adjure	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
Paul	1
preacheth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
Sceva,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
Paul	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
ye?	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaped	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
overcame	1
them,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
naked	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks	1
also	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Ephesus;	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
was	1
magnified.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
many	1
that	1
believed	1
came,	1
and	1
confessed,	1
and	1
shewed	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
19:19	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
used	1
curious	1
arts	1
brought	1
their	1
books	1
together,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
before	1
all	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
counted	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
19:20	1
So	1
mightily	1
grew	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prevailed.	1
	1
19:21	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
ended,	1
Paul	1
purposed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there,	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
see	1
Rome.	1
	1
19:22	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
into	1
Macedonia	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
Timotheus	1
and	1
Erastus;	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
stayed	1
in	1
Asia	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
there	1
arose	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
about	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:24	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Demetrius,	1
a	1
silversmith,	1
which	1
made	1
silver	1
shrines	1
for	1
Diana,	1
brought	1
no	1
small	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
craftsmen;	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
he	1
called	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
workmen	1
of	1
like	1
occupation,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
craft	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
wealth.	1
	1
19:26	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
that	1
not	1
alone	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
but	1
almost	1
throughout	1
all	1
Asia,	1
this	1
Paul	1
hath	1
persuaded	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
much	1
people,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
no	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
with	1
hands:	1
19:27	1
So	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
our	1
craft	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought;	1
but	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana	1
should	1
be	1
despised,	1
and	1
her	1
magnificence	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
whom	1
all	1
Asia	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
worshippeth.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
sayings,	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
wrath,	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
confusion:	1
and	1
having	1
caught	1
Gaius	1
and	1
Aristarchus,	1
men	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul's	1
companions	1
in	1
travel,	1
they	1
rushed	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
disciples	1
suffered	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
Asia,	1
which	1
were	1
his	1
friends,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
adventure	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:32	1
Some	1
therefore	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
some	1
another:	1
for	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
confused:	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
knew	1
not	1
wherefore	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
Alexander	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
the	1
Jews	1
putting	1
him	1
forward.	1
And	1
Alexander	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
defence	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew,	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
cried	1
out,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
townclerk	1
had	1
appeased	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians	1
is	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
Jupiter?	1
	1
19:36	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
cannot	1
be	1
spoken	1
against,	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly.	1
	1
19:37	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
hither	1
these	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
neither	1
robbers	1
of	1
churches,	1
nor	1
yet	1
blasphemers	1
of	1
your	1
goddess.	1
	1
19:38	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
Demetrius,	1
and	1
the	1
craftsmen	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
have	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
any	1
man,	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
deputies:	1
let	1
them	1
implead	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
19:39	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
enquire	1
any	1
thing	1
concerning	1
other	1
matters,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
determined	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
assembly.	1
	1
19:40	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
for	1
this	1
day's	1
uproar,	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
cause	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
concourse.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
dismissed	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
uproar	1
was	1
ceased,	1
Paul	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
those	1
parts,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
much	1
exhortation,	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
Greece,	1
20:3	1
And	1
there	1
abode	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
into	1
Syria,	1
he	1
purposed	1
to	1
return	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
there	1
accompanied	1
him	1
into	1
Asia	1
Sopater	1
of	1
Berea;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians,	1
Aristarchus	1
and	1
Secundus;	1
and	1
Gaius	1
of	1
Derbe,	1
and	1
Timotheus;	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
Tychicus	1
and	1
Trophimus.	1
	1
20:5	1
These	1
going	1
before	1
tarried	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
Troas.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
Philippi	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
Troas	1
in	1
five	1
days;	1
where	1
we	1
abode	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
break	1
bread,	1
Paul	1
preached	1
unto	1
them,	1
ready	1
to	1
depart	1
on	1
the	1
morrow;	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
until	1
midnight.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
window	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man	1
named	1
Eutychus,	1
being	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep:	1
and	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
long	1
preaching,	1
he	1
sunk	1
down	1
with	1
sleep,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
third	1
loft,	1
and	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Paul	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
said,	1
Trouble	1
not	1
yourselves;	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
When	1
he	1
therefore	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
bread,	1
and	1
eaten,	1
and	1
talked	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
even	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day,	1
so	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
alive,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
comforted.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
we	1
went	1
before	1
to	1
ship,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Assos,	1
there	1
intending	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
Paul:	1
for	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
appointed,	1
minding	1
himself	1
to	1
go	1
afoot.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
Assos,	1
we	1
took	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Mitylene.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
over	1
against	1
Chios;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
Samos,	1
and	1
tarried	1
at	1
Trogyllium;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Miletus.	1
	1
20:16	1
For	1
Paul	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
Ephesus,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Asia:	1
for	1
he	1
hasted,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
from	1
Miletus	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Asia,	1
after	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
seasons,	1
20:19	1
Serving	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
humility	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
tears,	1
and	1
temptations,	1
which	1
befell	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
20:20	1
And	1
how	1
I	1
kept	1
back	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
profitable	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
have	1
shewed	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
publickly,	1
and	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
20:21	1
Testifying	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
repentance	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
faith	1
toward	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
go	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
befall	1
me	1
there:	1
20:23	1
Save	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
witnesseth	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
saying	1
that	1
bonds	1
and	1
afflictions	1
abide	1
me.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
move	1
me,	1
neither	1
count	1
I	1
my	1
life	1
dear	1
unto	1
myself,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
finish	1
my	1
course	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
ministry,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
all,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
20:26	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
record	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
pure	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
20:27	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shunned	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:28	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
flock,	1
over	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
overseers,	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purchased	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood.	1
	1
20:29	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
departing	1
shall	1
grievous	1
wolves	1
enter	1
in	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
sparing	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
20:30	1
Also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
shall	1
men	1
arise,	1
speaking	1
perverse	1
things,	1
to	1
draw	1
away	1
disciples	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
20:31	1
Therefore	1
watch,	1
and	1
remember,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
warn	1
every	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
commend	1
you	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
you	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
20:33	1
I	1
have	1
coveted	1
no	1
man's	1
silver,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
apparel.	1
	1
20:34	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know,	1
that	1
these	1
hands	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
my	1
necessities,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:35	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
how	1
that	1
so	1
labouring	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
how	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
blessed	1
to	1
give	1
than	1
to	1
receive.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed	1
with	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
wept	1
sore,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
Paul's	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
20:38	1
Sorrowing	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
accompanied	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
gotten	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
launched,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
unto	1
Coos,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
unto	1
Rhodes,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
Patara:	1
21:2	1
And	1
finding	1
a	1
ship	1
sailing	1
over	1
unto	1
Phenicia,	1
we	1
went	1
aboard,	1
and	1
set	1
forth.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
discovered	1
Cyprus,	1
we	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
sailed	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
landed	1
at	1
Tyre:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
to	1
unlade	1
her	1
burden.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
finding	1
disciples,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
seven	1
days:	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
Paul	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
accomplished	1
those	1
days,	1
we	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
our	1
way;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
brought	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way,	1
with	1
wives	1
and	1
children,	1
till	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
we	1
kneeled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
our	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
we	1
took	1
ship;	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
again.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
our	1
course	1
from	1
Tyre,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Ptolemais,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
Paul's	1
company	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea:	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Philip	1
the	1
evangelist,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven;	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
had	1
four	1
daughters,	1
virgins,	1
which	1
did	1
prophesy.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
a	1
certain	1
prophet,	1
named	1
Agabus.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
us,	1
he	1
took	1
Paul's	1
girdle,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
Jews	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
bind	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
owneth	1
this	1
girdle,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
besought	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:13	1
Then	1
Paul	1
answered,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
mine	1
heart?	1
	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
die	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
we	1
ceased,	1
saying,	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
we	1
took	1
up	1
our	1
carriages,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:16	1
There	1
went	1
with	1
us	1
also	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
Mnason	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
an	1
old	1
disciple,	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
should	1
lodge.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
brethren	1
received	1
us	1
gladly.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
Paul	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
James;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
saluted	1
them,	1
he	1
declared	1
particularly	1
what	1
things	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
his	1
ministry.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest,	1
brother,	1
how	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Jews	1
there	1
are	1
which	1
believe;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
21:21	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
informed	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
teachest	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
forsake	1
Moses,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
circumcise	1
their	1
children,	1
neither	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
customs.	1
	1
21:22	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
therefore?	1
the	1
multitude	1
must	1
needs	1
come	1
together:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
	1
21:23	1
Do	1
therefore	1
this	1
that	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
thee:	1
We	1
have	1
four	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
vow	1
on	1
them;	1
21:24	1
Them	1
take,	1
and	1
purify	1
thyself	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
charges	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
shave	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
those	1
things,	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
informed	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
are	1
nothing;	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
also	1
walkest	1
orderly,	1
and	1
keepest	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
21:25	1
As	1
touching	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
believe,	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
concluded	1
that	1
they	1
observe	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
save	1
only	1
that	1
they	1
keep	1
themselves	1
from	1
things	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication.	1
	1
21:26	1
Then	1
Paul	1
took	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
purifying	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
purification,	1
until	1
that	1
an	1
offering	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
almost	1
ended,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Asia,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
stirred	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
21:28	1
Crying	1
out,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
help:	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
teacheth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
this	1
place:	1
and	1
further	1
brought	1
Greeks	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
hath	1
polluted	1
this	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
21:29	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
Trophimus	1
an	1
Ephesian,	1
whom	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
temple.)	1
21:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut.	1
	1
21:31	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
tidings	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
band,	1
that	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
uproar.	1
	1
21:32	1
Who	1
immediately	1
took	1
soldiers	1
and	1
centurions,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
they	1
left	1
beating	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
21:33	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains;	1
and	1
demanded	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
some	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
some	1
another,	1
among	1
the	1
multitude:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
tumult,	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:36	1
For	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
after,	1
crying,	1
Away	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
Who	1
said,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
speak	1
Greek?	1
	1
21:38	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
that	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
madest	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
leddest	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
murderers?	1
	1
21:39	1
But	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
no	1
mean	1
city:	1
and,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
licence,	1
Paul	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
silence,	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
saying,	1
22:1	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hear	1
ye	1
my	1
defence	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
now	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
22:2	1
(And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
more	1
silence:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,)	1
22:3	1
I	1
am	1
verily	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew,	1
born	1
in	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
yet	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Gamaliel,	1
and	1
taught	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
perfect	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
zealous	1
toward	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
I	1
persecuted	1
this	1
way	1
unto	1
the	1
death,	1
binding	1
and	1
delivering	1
into	1
prisons	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
22:5	1
As	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
doth	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
elders:	1
from	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
received	1
letters	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
punished.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Damascus	1
about	1
noon,	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shone	1
from	1
heaven	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
round	1
about	1
me.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
indeed	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid;	1
but	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
LORD?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Damascus;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
light,	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
one	1
Ananias,	1
a	1
devout	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
22:13	1
Came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
I	1
looked	1
up	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
know	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
Just	1
One,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
his	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
now	1
why	1
tarriest	1
thou?	1
arise,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
wash	1
away	1
thy	1
sins,	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
while	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
trance;	1
22:18	1
And	1
saw	1
him	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
thy	1
testimony	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
imprisoned	1
and	1
beat	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
on	1
thee:	1
22:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
martyr	1
Stephen	1
was	1
shed,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Depart:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
far	1
hence	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
audience	1
unto	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Away	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
live.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
threw	1
dust	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
22:24	1
The	1
chief	1
captain	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
bade	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
scourging;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
so	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
thongs,	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
scourge	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
uncondemned?	1
	1
22:26	1
When	1
the	1
centurion	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
thou	1
doest:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
22:27	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
art	1
thou	1
a	1
Roman?	1
He	1
said,	1
Yea.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
answered,	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
sum	1
obtained	1
I	1
this	1
freedom.	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
free	1
born.	1
	1
22:29	1
Then	1
straightway	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
examined	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
also	1
was	1
afraid,	1
after	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
bound	1
him.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
certainty	1
wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
loosed	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
bands,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
council	1
to	1
appear,	1
and	1
brought	1
Paul	1
down,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Paul,	1
earnestly	1
beholding	1
the	1
council,	1
said,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
Ananias	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee,	1
thou	1
whited	1
wall:	1
for	1
sittest	1
thou	1
to	1
judge	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
commandest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said,	1
Revilest	1
thou	1
God's	1
high	1
priest?	1
	1
23:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
wist	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
were	1
Sadducees,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Pharisees,	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Pharisee:	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
and	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
dissension	1
between	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees:	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
was	1
divided.	1
	1
23:8	1
For	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
neither	1
angel,	1
nor	1
spirit:	1
but	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
confess	1
both.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
cry:	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees'	1
part	1
arose,	1
and	1
strove,	1
saying,	1
We	1
find	1
no	1
evil	1
in	1
this	1
man:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
spirit	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
dissension,	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
Paul	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
pulled	1
in	1
pieces	1
of	1
them,	1
commanded	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
the	1
night	1
following	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
Paul:	1
for	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
testified	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
must	1
thou	1
bear	1
witness	1
also	1
at	1
Rome.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
banded	1
together,	1
and	1
bound	1
themselves	1
under	1
a	1
curse,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
conspiracy.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
curse,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
eat	1
nothing	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
slain	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
council	1
signify	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
that	1
he	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
morrow,	1
as	1
though	1
ye	1
would	1
enquire	1
something	1
more	1
perfectly	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
we,	1
or	1
ever	1
he	1
come	1
near,	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
when	1
Paul's	1
sister's	1
son	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
told	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
Paul	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
centurions	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
23:18	1
So	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
and	1
said,	1
Paul	1
the	1
prisoner	1
called	1
me	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
prayed	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
thee,	1
who	1
hath	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
aside	1
privately,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
tell	1
me?	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
Jews	1
have	1
agreed	1
to	1
desire	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
bring	1
down	1
Paul	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
the	1
council,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
enquire	1
somewhat	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
yield	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
men,	1
which	1
have	1
bound	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
him:	1
and	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
ready,	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
promise	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
23:22	1
So	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
then	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
depart,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
centurions,	1
saying,	1
Make	1
ready	1
two	1
hundred	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
horsemen	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten,	1
and	1
spearmen	1
two	1
hundred,	1
at	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night;	1
23:24	1
And	1
provide	1
them	1
beasts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
set	1
Paul	1
on,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
safe	1
unto	1
Felix	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
23:26	1
Claudius	1
Lysias	1
unto	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
governor	1
Felix	1
sendeth	1
greeting.	1
	1
23:27	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
of	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
I	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
rescued	1
him,	1
having	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
they	1
accused	1
him,	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
their	1
council:	1
23:29	1
Whom	1
I	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
of	1
questions	1
of	1
their	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
laid	1
to	1
his	1
charge	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
sent	1
straightway	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
his	1
accusers	1
also	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
thee	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
against	1
him.	1
Farewell.	1
	1
23:31	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them,	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
Antipatris.	1
	1
23:32	1
On	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
horsemen	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
castle:	1
23:33	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle	1
to	1
the	1
governor,	1
presented	1
Paul	1
also	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
what	1
province	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Cilicia;	1
23:35	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
thee,	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
thine	1
accusers	1
are	1
also	1
come.	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
Herod's	1
judgment	1
hall.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
after	1
five	1
days	1
Ananias	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
descended	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
orator	1
named	1
Tertullus,	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
governor	1
against	1
Paul.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
forth,	1
Tertullus	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Seeing	1
that	1
by	1
thee	1
we	1
enjoy	1
great	1
quietness,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
are	1
done	1
unto	1
this	1
nation	1
by	1
thy	1
providence,	1
24:3	1
We	1
accept	1
it	1
always,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places,	1
most	1
noble	1
Felix,	1
with	1
all	1
thankfulness.	1
	1
24:4	1
Notwithstanding,	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
further	1
tedious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
hear	1
us	1
of	1
thy	1
clemency	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
pestilent	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
mover	1
of	1
sedition	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
throughout	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
ringleader	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarenes:	1
24:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
gone	1
about	1
to	1
profane	1
the	1
temple:	1
whom	1
we	1
took,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
law.	1
	1
24:7	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
Lysias	1
came	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
24:8	1
Commanding	1
his	1
accusers	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
by	1
examining	1
of	1
whom	1
thyself	1
mayest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
whereof	1
we	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
assented,	1
saying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
24:10	1
Then	1
Paul,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
speak,	1
answered,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
judge	1
unto	1
this	1
nation,	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
more	1
cheerfully	1
answer	1
for	1
myself:	1
24:11	1
Because	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
understand,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
yet	1
but	1
twelve	1
days	1
since	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
neither	1
found	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
disputing	1
with	1
any	1
man,	1
neither	1
raising	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
city:	1
24:13	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
prove	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
they	1
now	1
accuse	1
me.	1
	1
24:14	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
confess	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
heresy,	1
so	1
worship	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
believing	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets:	1
24:15	1
And	1
have	1
hope	1
toward	1
God,	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
also	1
allow,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
unjust.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
herein	1
do	1
I	1
exercise	1
myself,	1
to	1
have	1
always	1
a	1
conscience	1
void	1
to	1
offence	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
24:17	1
Now	1
after	1
many	1
years	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
bring	1
alms	1
to	1
my	1
nation,	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
24:18	1
Whereupon	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Asia	1
found	1
me	1
purified	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
neither	1
with	1
multitude,	1
nor	1
with	1
tumult.	1
	1
24:19	1
Who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
object,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
ought	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
24:20	1
Or	1
else	1
let	1
these	1
same	1
here	1
say,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
found	1
any	1
evil	1
doing	1
in	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
council,	1
24:21	1
Except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
voice,	1
that	1
I	1
cried	1
standing	1
among	1
them,	1
Touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
by	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
when	1
Felix	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
having	1
more	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
deferred	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Lysias	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
I	1
will	1
know	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
your	1
matter.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
a	1
centurion	1
to	1
keep	1
Paul,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
liberty,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
forbid	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
minister	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days,	1
when	1
Felix	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Drusilla,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
Paul,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
reasoned	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
temperance,	1
and	1
judgment	1
to	1
come,	1
Felix	1
trembled,	1
and	1
answered,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way	1
for	1
this	1
time;	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
convenient	1
season,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
24:26	1
He	1
hoped	1
also	1
that	1
money	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
Paul,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
loose	1
him:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
oftener,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:27	1
But	1
after	1
two	1
years	1
Porcius	1
Festus	1
came	1
into	1
Felix'	1
room:	1
and	1
Felix,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
left	1
Paul	1
bound.	1
	1
25:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Festus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
province,	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
ascended	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
25:2	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
him	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
25:3	1
And	1
desired	1
favour	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
laying	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
25:4	1
But	1
Festus	1
answered,	1
that	1
Paul	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
depart	1
shortly	1
thither.	1
	1
25:5	1
Let	1
them	1
therefore,	1
said	1
he,	1
which	1
among	1
you	1
are	1
able,	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
accuse	1
this	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wickedness	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tarried	1
among	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
days,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
Caesarea;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
commanded	1
Paul	1
to	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
laid	1
many	1
and	1
grievous	1
complaints	1
against	1
Paul,	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
prove.	1
	1
25:8	1
While	1
he	1
answered	1
for	1
himself,	1
Neither	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
neither	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
nor	1
yet	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
Festus,	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
answered	1
Paul,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
25:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
Caesar's	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
where	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
judged:	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
wrong,	1
as	1
thou	1
very	1
well	1
knowest.	1
	1
25:11	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
an	1
offender,	1
or	1
have	1
committed	1
any	1
thing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
whereof	1
these	1
accuse	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
deliver	1
me	1
unto	1
them.	1
I	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:12	1
Then	1
Festus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
with	1
the	1
council,	1
answered,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar?	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days	1
king	1
Agrippa	1
and	1
Bernice	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
salute	1
Festus.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
Festus	1
declared	1
Paul's	1
cause	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
bonds	1
by	1
Felix:	1
25:15	1
About	1
whom,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
me,	1
desiring	1
to	1
have	1
judgment	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:16	1
To	1
whom	1
I	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Romans	1
to	1
deliver	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
die,	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
accused	1
have	1
the	1
accusers	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
have	1
licence	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
himself	1
concerning	1
the	1
crime	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:17	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
hither,	1
without	1
any	1
delay	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:18	1
Against	1
whom	1
when	1
the	1
accusers	1
stood	1
up,	1
they	1
brought	1
none	1
accusation	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
I	1
supposed:	1
25:19	1
But	1
had	1
certain	1
questions	1
against	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
superstition,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
whom	1
Paul	1
affirmed	1
to	1
be	1
alive.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
doubted	1
of	1
such	1
manner	1
of	1
questions,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
matters.	1
	1
25:21	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
till	1
I	1
might	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:22	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
I	1
would	1
also	1
hear	1
the	1
man	1
myself.	1
To	1
morrow,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
Agrippa	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
with	1
great	1
pomp,	1
and	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
hearing,	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
principal	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
at	1
Festus'	1
commandment	1
Paul	1
was	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
Festus	1
said,	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
here	1
present	1
with	1
us,	1
ye	1
see	1
this	1
man,	1
about	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
me,	1
both	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
also	1
here,	1
crying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
any	1
longer.	1
	1
25:25	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
appealed	1
to	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
him.	1
	1
25:26	1
Of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
specially	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
that,	1
after	1
examination	1
had,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
write.	1
	1
25:27	1
For	1
it	1
seemeth	1
to	1
me	1
unreasonable	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
not	1
withal	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
crimes	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
26:1	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Thou	1
art	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
answered	1
for	1
himself:	1
26:2	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
happy,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
because	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
thee	1
touching	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
26:3	1
Especially	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
expert	1
in	1
all	1
customs	1
and	1
questions	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Jews:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
patiently.	1
	1
26:4	1
My	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
my	1
youth,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
mine	1
own	1
nation	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
Jews;	1
26:5	1
Which	1
knew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
testify,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
straitest	1
sect	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
I	1
lived	1
a	1
Pharisee.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
am	1
judged	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers:	1
26:7	1
Unto	1
which	1
promise	1
our	1
twelve	1
tribes,	1
instantly	1
serving	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
hope	1
to	1
come.	1
For	1
which	1
hope's	1
sake,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
26:8	1
Why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
incredible	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
raise	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
26:9	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
many	1
things	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:10	1
Which	1
thing	1
I	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
did	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
prison,	1
having	1
received	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
voice	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
punished	1
them	1
oft	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
compelled	1
them	1
to	1
blaspheme;	1
and	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
mad	1
against	1
them,	1
I	1
persecuted	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
strange	1
cities.	1
	1
26:12	1
Whereupon	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
commission	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:13	1
At	1
midday,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven,	1
above	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
shining	1
round	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
26:16	1
But	1
rise,	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
purpose,	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
minister	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
thee;	1
26:17	1
Delivering	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
unto	1
whom	1
now	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
26:18	1
To	1
open	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
darkness	1
to	1
light,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
inheritance	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
26:19	1
Whereupon,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
disobedient	1
unto	1
the	1
heavenly	1
vision:	1
26:20	1
But	1
shewed	1
first	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
works	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance.	1
	1
26:21	1
For	1
these	1
causes	1
the	1
Jews	1
caught	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
Having	1
therefore	1
obtained	1
help	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
continue	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
witnessing	1
both	1
to	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
saying	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
Moses	1
did	1
say	1
should	1
come:	1
26:23	1
That	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
should	1
shew	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
thus	1
spake	1
for	1
himself,	1
Festus	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Paul,	1
thou	1
art	1
beside	1
thyself;	1
much	1
learning	1
doth	1
make	1
thee	1
mad.	1
	1
26:25	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mad,	1
most	1
noble	1
Festus;	1
but	1
speak	1
forth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness.	1
	1
26:26	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
knoweth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
before	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
speak	1
freely:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
hidden	1
from	1
him;	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
	1
26:27	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
believest	1
thou	1
the	1
prophets?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
believest.	1
	1
26:28	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Almost	1
thou	1
persuadest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
thou,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
were	1
both	1
almost,	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
except	1
these	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
them:	1
26:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
aside,	1
they	1
talked	1
between	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
doeth	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Agrippa	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
This	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
at	1
liberty,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sail	1
into	1
Italy,	1
they	1
delivered	1
Paul	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
prisoners	1
unto	1
one	1
named	1
Julius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
Augustus'	1
band.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Adramyttium,	1
we	1
launched,	1
meaning	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Asia;	1
one	1
Aristarchus,	1
a	1
Macedonian	1
of	1
Thessalonica,	1
being	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
touched	1
at	1
Sidon.	1
And	1
Julius	1
courteously	1
entreated	1
Paul,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
liberty	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
refresh	1
himself.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
launched	1
from	1
thence,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Cyprus,	1
because	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
contrary.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Myra,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Lycia.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
centurion	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria	1
sailing	1
into	1
Italy;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
therein.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
slowly	1
many	1
days,	1
and	1
scarce	1
were	1
come	1
over	1
against	1
Cnidus,	1
the	1
wind	1
not	1
suffering	1
us,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Crete,	1
over	1
against	1
Salmone;	1
27:8	1
And,	1
hardly	1
passing	1
it,	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
fair	1
havens;	1
nigh	1
whereunto	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lasea.	1
	1
27:9	1
Now	1
when	1
much	1
time	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
when	1
sailing	1
was	1
now	1
dangerous,	1
because	1
the	1
fast	1
was	1
now	1
already	1
past,	1
Paul	1
admonished	1
them,	1
27:10	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sirs,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
voyage	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
hurt	1
and	1
much	1
damage,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
lading	1
and	1
ship,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
	1
27:11	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
centurion	1
believed	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
more	1
than	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
haven	1
was	1
not	1
commodious	1
to	1
winter	1
in,	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
advised	1
to	1
depart	1
thence	1
also,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
attain	1
to	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
winter;	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
Crete,	1
and	1
lieth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
west	1
and	1
north	1
west.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew	1
softly,	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
their	1
purpose,	1
loosing	1
thence,	1
they	1
sailed	1
close	1
by	1
Crete.	1
	1
27:14	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
there	1
arose	1
against	1
it	1
a	1
tempestuous	1
wind,	1
called	1
Euroclydon.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
caught,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
we	1
let	1
her	1
drive.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
running	1
under	1
a	1
certain	1
island	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Clauda,	1
we	1
had	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
boat:	1
27:17	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
used	1
helps,	1
undergirding	1
the	1
ship;	1
and,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
quicksands,	1
strake	1
sail,	1
and	1
so	1
were	1
driven.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
we	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
tossed	1
with	1
a	1
tempest,	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship;	1
27:19	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
we	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
the	1
tackling	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
when	1
neither	1
sun	1
nor	1
stars	1
in	1
many	1
days	1
appeared,	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
tempest	1
lay	1
on	1
us,	1
all	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
was	1
then	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
after	1
long	1
abstinence	1
Paul	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
loosed	1
from	1
Crete,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
this	1
harm	1
and	1
loss.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
loss	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
life	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:23	1
For	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
me	1
this	1
night	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
serve,	1
27:24	1
Saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Paul;	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Caesar:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sail	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
27:25	1
Wherefore,	1
sirs,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
God,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me.	1
	1
27:26	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
island.	1
	1
27:27	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
night	1
was	1
come,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
Adria,	1
about	1
midnight	1
the	1
shipmen	1
deemed	1
that	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
some	1
country;	1
27:28	1
And	1
sounded,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
twenty	1
fathoms:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
further,	1
they	1
sounded	1
again,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifteen	1
fathoms.	1
	1
27:29	1
Then	1
fearing	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
upon	1
rocks,	1
they	1
cast	1
four	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
shipmen	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
boat	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
under	1
colour	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
cast	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foreship,	1
27:31	1
Paul	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
centurion	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
Except	1
these	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
27:32	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
fall	1
off.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
coming	1
on,	1
Paul	1
besought	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
take	1
meat,	1
saying,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
tarried	1
and	1
continued	1
fasting,	1
having	1
taken	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:34	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
meat:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
health:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
it,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
27:36	1
Then	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
some	1
meat.	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
two	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
sixteen	1
souls.	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
enough,	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
certain	1
creek	1
with	1
a	1
shore,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
minded,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
to	1
thrust	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:40	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
anchors,	1
they	1
committed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
loosed	1
the	1
rudder	1
bands,	1
and	1
hoised	1
up	1
the	1
mainsail	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
made	1
toward	1
shore.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
seas	1
met,	1
they	1
ran	1
the	1
ship	1
aground;	1
and	1
the	1
forepart	1
stuck	1
fast,	1
and	1
remained	1
unmoveable,	1
but	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
was	1
broken	1
with	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
waves.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
counsel	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
swim	1
out,	1
and	1
escape.	1
	1
27:43	1
But	1
the	1
centurion,	1
willing	1
to	1
save	1
Paul,	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
purpose;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
could	1
swim	1
should	1
cast	1
themselves	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
land:	1
27:44	1
And	1
the	1
rest,	1
some	1
on	1
boards,	1
and	1
some	1
on	1
broken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
escaped	1
all	1
safe	1
to	1
land.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
escaped,	1
then	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
was	1
called	1
Melita.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
the	1
barbarous	1
people	1
shewed	1
us	1
no	1
little	1
kindness:	1
for	1
they	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
received	1
us	1
every	1
one,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
rain,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cold.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
viper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
barbarians	1
saw	1
the	1
venomous	1
beast	1
hang	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
No	1
doubt	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
murderer,	1
whom,	1
though	1
he	1
hath	1
escaped	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
vengeance	1
suffereth	1
not	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
beast	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
28:6	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
looked	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
swollen,	1
or	1
fallen	1
down	1
dead	1
suddenly:	1
but	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
a	1
great	1
while,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
harm	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god.	1
	1
28:7	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
quarters	1
were	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Publius;	1
who	1
received	1
us,	1
and	1
lodged	1
us	1
three	1
days	1
courteously.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Publius	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
bloody	1
flux:	1
to	1
whom	1
Paul	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
28:9	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
others	1
also,	1
which	1
had	1
diseases	1
in	1
the	1
island,	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
healed:	1
28:10	1
Who	1
also	1
honoured	1
us	1
with	1
many	1
honours;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
departed,	1
they	1
laded	1
us	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
necessary.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
months	1
we	1
departed	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria,	1
which	1
had	1
wintered	1
in	1
the	1
isle,	1
whose	1
sign	1
was	1
Castor	1
and	1
Pollux.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
landing	1
at	1
Syracuse,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
we	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Rhegium:	1
and	1
after	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Puteoli:	1
28:14	1
Where	1
we	1
found	1
brethren,	1
and	1
were	1
desired	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
toward	1
Rome.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Appii	1
forum,	1
and	1
The	1
three	1
taverns:	1
whom	1
when	1
Paul	1
saw,	1
he	1
thanked	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
courage.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Rome,	1
the	1
centurion	1
delivered	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard:	1
but	1
Paul	1
was	1
suffered	1
to	1
dwell	1
by	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
soldier	1
that	1
kept	1
him.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
Paul	1
called	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
together:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
customs	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
yet	1
was	1
I	1
delivered	1
prisoner	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Romans.	1
	1
28:18	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
examined	1
me,	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
28:19	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
spake	1
against	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ought	1
to	1
accuse	1
my	1
nation	1
of.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
with	1
this	1
chain.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
neither	1
received	1
letters	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
came	1
shewed	1
or	1
spake	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
28:22	1
But	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
thinkest:	1
for	1
as	1
concerning	1
this	1
sect,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
spoken	1
against.	1
	1
28:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
him	1
a	1
day,	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
lodging;	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
expounded	1
and	1
testified	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
persuading	1
them	1
concerning	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
evening.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
some	1
believed	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken,	1
and	1
some	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
28:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
agreed	1
not	1
among	1
themselves,	1
they	1
departed,	1
after	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
spoken	1
one	1
word,	1
Well	1
spake	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers,	1
28:26	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive:	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
have	1
they	1
closed;	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
28:28	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
28:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Jews	1
departed,	1
and	1
had	1
great	1
reasoning	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
28:30	1
And	1
Paul	1
dwelt	1
two	1
whole	1
years	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hired	1
house,	1
and	1
received	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
28:31	1
Preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
teaching	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
with	1
all	1
confidence,	1
no	1
man	1
forbidding	1
him.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Romans	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle,	1
separated	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
1:2	1
(Which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
afore	1
by	1
his	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,)	1
1:3	1
Concerning	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
1:4	1
And	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
power,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
holiness,	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:5	1
By	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
grace	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
for	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
for	1
his	1
name:	1
1:6	1
Among	1
whom	1
are	1
ye	1
also	1
the	1
called	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
To	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Rome,	1
beloved	1
of	1
God,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints:	1
Grace	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
First,	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:10	1
Making	1
request,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
now	1
at	1
length	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
prosperous	1
journey	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
impart	1
unto	1
you	1
some	1
spiritual	1
gift,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
established;	1
1:12	1
That	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
comforted	1
together	1
with	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
faith	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
oftentimes	1
I	1
purposed	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
(but	1
was	1
let	1
hitherto,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
fruit	1
among	1
you	1
also,	1
even	1
as	1
among	1
other	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
am	1
debtor	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Barbarians;	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unwise.	1
	1
1:15	1
So,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
me	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Rome	1
also.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
salvation	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth;	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greek.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
therein	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
revealed	1
from	1
faith	1
to	1
faith:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
against	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
unrighteousness	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
hold	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
unrighteousness;	1
1:19	1
Because	1
that	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
known	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
manifest	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
it	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
invisible	1
things	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
clearly	1
seen,	1
being	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
even	1
his	1
eternal	1
power	1
and	1
Godhead;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
excuse:	1
1:21	1
Because	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
God,	1
they	1
glorified	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
God,	1
neither	1
were	1
thankful;	1
but	1
became	1
vain	1
in	1
their	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
their	1
foolish	1
heart	1
was	1
darkened.	1
	1
1:22	1
Professing	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
wise,	1
they	1
became	1
fools,	1
1:23	1
And	1
changed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
uncorruptible	1
God	1
into	1
an	1
image	1
made	1
like	1
to	1
corruptible	1
man,	1
and	1
to	1
birds,	1
and	1
fourfooted	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things.	1
	1
1:24	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
to	1
dishonour	1
their	1
own	1
bodies	1
between	1
themselves:	1
1:25	1
Who	1
changed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
creature	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Creator,	1
who	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
vile	1
affections:	1
for	1
even	1
their	1
women	1
did	1
change	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
into	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
against	1
nature:	1
1:27	1
And	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
men,	1
leaving	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
burned	1
in	1
their	1
lust	1
one	1
toward	1
another;	1
men	1
with	1
men	1
working	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
recompence	1
of	1
their	1
error	1
which	1
was	1
meet.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
retain	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
knowledge,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
reprobate	1
mind,	1
to	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient;	1
1:29	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
unrighteousness,	1
fornication,	1
wickedness,	1
covetousness,	1
maliciousness;	1
full	1
of	1
envy,	1
murder,	1
debate,	1
deceit,	1
malignity;	1
whisperers,	1
1:30	1
Backbiters,	1
haters	1
of	1
God,	1
despiteful,	1
proud,	1
boasters,	1
inventors	1
of	1
evil	1
things,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
1:31	1
Without	1
understanding,	1
covenantbreakers,	1
without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
implacable,	1
unmerciful:	1
1:32	1
Who	1
knowing	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
inexcusable,	1
O	1
man,	1
whosoever	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
judgest:	1
for	1
wherein	1
thou	1
judgest	1
another,	1
thou	1
condemnest	1
thyself;	1
for	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
doest	1
the	1
same	1
things.	1
	1
2:2	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
truth	1
against	1
them	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
this,	1
O	1
man,	1
that	1
judgest	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
doest	1
the	1
same,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
2:4	1
Or	1
despisest	1
thou	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
forbearance	1
and	1
longsuffering;	1
not	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
to	1
repentance?	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
after	1
thy	1
hardness	1
and	1
impenitent	1
heart	1
treasurest	1
up	1
unto	1
thyself	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
will	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
deeds:	1
2:7	1
To	1
them	1
who	1
by	1
patient	1
continuance	1
in	1
well	1
doing	1
seek	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
immortality,	1
eternal	1
life:	1
2:8	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
contentious,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
obey	1
unrighteousness,	1
indignation	1
and	1
wrath,	1
2:9	1
Tribulation	1
and	1
anguish,	1
upon	1
every	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil,	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentile;	1
2:10	1
But	1
glory,	1
honour,	1
and	1
peace,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
worketh	1
good,	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentile:	1
2:11	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
without	1
law	1
shall	1
also	1
perish	1
without	1
law:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
2:13	1
(For	1
not	1
the	1
hearers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
just	1
before	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
things	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
these,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
are	1
a	1
law	1
unto	1
themselves:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
shew	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
their	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
witness,	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
accusing	1
or	1
else	1
excusing	1
one	1
another;)	1
2:16	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
God	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:17	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
restest	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
God,	1
2:18	1
And	1
knowest	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
approvest	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
more	1
excellent,	1
being	1
instructed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
2:19	1
And	1
art	1
confident	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
art	1
a	1
guide	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
2:20	1
An	1
instructor	1
of	1
the	1
foolish,	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
babes,	1
which	1
hast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:21	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
which	1
teachest	1
another,	1
teachest	1
thou	1
not	1
thyself?	1
thou	1
that	1
preachest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
steal,	1
dost	1
thou	1
steal?	1
	1
2:22	1
Thou	1
that	1
sayest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
adultery?	1
thou	1
that	1
abhorrest	1
idols,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
sacrilege?	1
	1
2:23	1
Thou	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
through	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
dishonourest	1
thou	1
God?	1
	1
2:24	1
For	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
blasphemed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
circumcision	1
verily	1
profiteth,	1
if	1
thou	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breaker	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
thy	1
circumcision	1
is	1
made	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
if	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
keep	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
shall	1
not	1
his	1
uncircumcision	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
circumcision?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
uncircumcision	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
nature,	1
if	1
it	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law,	1
judge	1
thee,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
circumcision	1
dost	1
transgress	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
2:28	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
outwardly;	1
neither	1
is	1
that	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
is	1
outward	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
2:29	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
inwardly;	1
and	1
circumcision	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
What	1
advantage	1
then	1
hath	1
the	1
Jew?	1
or	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
circumcision?	1
	1
3:2	1
Much	1
every	1
way:	1
chiefly,	1
because	1
that	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
committed	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
what	1
if	1
some	1
did	1
not	1
believe?	1
shall	1
their	1
unbelief	1
make	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
effect?	1
	1
3:4	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
let	1
God	1
be	1
true,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
liar;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
thy	1
sayings,	1
and	1
mightest	1
overcome	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
judged.	1
	1
3:5	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
unrighteousness	1
commend	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say?	1
Is	1
God	1
unrighteous	1
who	1
taketh	1
vengeance?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
man)	1
3:6	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
then	1
how	1
shall	1
God	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
more	1
abounded	1
through	1
my	1
lie	1
unto	1
his	1
glory;	1
why	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
also	1
judged	1
as	1
a	1
sinner?	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
not	1
rather,	1
(as	1
we	1
be	1
slanderously	1
reported,	1
and	1
as	1
some	1
affirm	1
that	1
we	1
say,)	1
Let	1
us	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
good	1
may	1
come?	1
whose	1
damnation	1
is	1
just.	1
	1
3:9	1
What	1
then?	1
are	1
we	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
No,	1
in	1
no	1
wise:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
proved	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
under	1
sin;	1
3:10	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
righteous,	1
no,	1
not	1
one:	1
3:11	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
understandeth,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
seeketh	1
after	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
they	1
are	1
together	1
become	1
unprofitable;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
3:13	1
Their	1
throat	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre;	1
with	1
their	1
tongues	1
they	1
have	1
used	1
deceit;	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
asps	1
is	1
under	1
their	1
lips:	1
3:14	1
Whose	1
mouth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
cursing	1
and	1
bitterness:	1
3:15	1
Their	1
feet	1
are	1
swift	1
to	1
shed	1
blood:	1
3:16	1
Destruction	1
and	1
misery	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
ways:	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
known:	1
3:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
3:19	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
the	1
law	1
saith,	1
it	1
saith	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law:	1
that	1
every	1
mouth	1
may	1
be	1
stopped,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
become	1
guilty	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Therefore	1
by	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
manifested,	1
being	1
witnessed	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
3:22	1
Even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
all	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference:	1
3:23	1
For	1
all	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God;	1
3:24	1
Being	1
justified	1
freely	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
3:25	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
propitiation	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
that	1
are	1
past,	1
through	1
the	1
forbearance	1
of	1
God;	1
3:26	1
To	1
declare,	1
I	1
say,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
just,	1
and	1
the	1
justifier	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
believeth	1
in	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
Where	1
is	1
boasting	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
excluded.	1
By	1
what	1
law?	1
of	1
works?	1
Nay:	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
3:28	1
Therefore	1
we	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
faith	1
without	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:29	1
Is	1
he	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only?	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
Yes,	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also:	1
3:30	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
which	1
shall	1
justify	1
the	1
circumcision	1
by	1
faith,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:31	1
Do	1
we	1
then	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
law	1
through	1
faith?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
we	1
establish	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
4:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then	1
that	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
found?	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
if	1
Abraham	1
were	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
to	1
glory;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:4	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
is	1
the	1
reward	1
not	1
reckoned	1
of	1
grace,	1
but	1
of	1
debt.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
not,	1
but	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
justifieth	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
his	1
faith	1
is	1
counted	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:6	1
Even	1
as	1
David	1
also	1
describeth	1
the	1
blessedness	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
whom	1
God	1
imputeth	1
righteousness	1
without	1
works,	1
4:7	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
whose	1
iniquities	1
are	1
forgiven,	1
and	1
whose	1
sins	1
are	1
covered.	1
	1
4:8	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
impute	1
sin.	1
	1
4:9	1
Cometh	1
this	1
blessedness	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
also?	1
for	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
faith	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Abraham	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:10	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
reckoned?	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
or	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
Not	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
but	1
in	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
circumcision,	1
a	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
being	1
uncircumcised:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
circumcised;	1
that	1
righteousness	1
might	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
them	1
also:	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
circumcision	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
that	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
being	1
yet	1
uncircumcised.	1
	1
4:13	1
For	1
the	1
promise,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
seed,	1
through	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
be	1
heirs,	1
faith	1
is	1
made	1
void,	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect:	1
4:15	1
Because	1
the	1
law	1
worketh	1
wrath:	1
for	1
where	1
no	1
law	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
transgression.	1
	1
4:16	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
faith,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
grace;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
promise	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
seed;	1
not	1
to	1
that	1
only	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Abraham;	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
us	1
all,	1
4:17	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,)	1
before	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
believed,	1
even	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
calleth	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were.	1
	1
4:18	1
Who	1
against	1
hope	1
believed	1
in	1
hope,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
being	1
not	1
weak	1
in	1
faith,	1
he	1
considered	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
now	1
dead,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
neither	1
yet	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
Sarah's	1
womb:	1
4:20	1
He	1
staggered	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
unbelief;	1
but	1
was	1
strong	1
in	1
faith,	1
giving	1
glory	1
to	1
God;	1
4:21	1
And	1
being	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
promised,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
perform.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:23	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
written	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
alone,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him;	1
4:24	1
But	1
for	1
us	1
also,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed,	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
4:25	1
Who	1
was	1
delivered	1
for	1
our	1
offences,	1
and	1
was	1
raised	1
again	1
for	1
our	1
justification.	1
	1
5:1	1
Therefore	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
faith,	1
we	1
have	1
peace	1
with	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
5:2	1
By	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
faith	1
into	1
this	1
grace	1
wherein	1
we	1
stand,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
glory	1
in	1
tribulations	1
also:	1
knowing	1
that	1
tribulation	1
worketh	1
patience;	1
5:4	1
And	1
patience,	1
experience;	1
and	1
experience,	1
hope:	1
5:5	1
And	1
hope	1
maketh	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
because	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
shed	1
abroad	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
without	1
strength,	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
scarcely	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
will	1
one	1
die:	1
yet	1
peradventure	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
some	1
would	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
God	1
commendeth	1
his	1
love	1
toward	1
us,	1
in	1
that,	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
sinners,	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:9	1
Much	1
more	1
then,	1
being	1
now	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
blood,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
wrath	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
if,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
enemies,	1
we	1
were	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
much	1
more,	1
being	1
reconciled,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
also	1
joy	1
in	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
received	1
the	1
atonement.	1
	1
5:12	1
Wherefore,	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
death	1
by	1
sin;	1
and	1
so	1
death	1
passed	1
upon	1
all	1
men,	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
have	1
sinned:	1
5:13	1
(For	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
sin	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:14	1
Nevertheless	1
death	1
reigned	1
from	1
Adam	1
to	1
Moses,	1
even	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
sinned	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Adam's	1
transgression,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
offence,	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
free	1
gift.	1
For	1
if	1
through	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
many	1
be	1
dead,	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
gift	1
by	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
one	1
man,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
abounded	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
that	1
sinned,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
condemnation,	1
but	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
is	1
of	1
many	1
offences	1
unto	1
justification.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
if	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
offence	1
death	1
reigned	1
by	1
one;	1
much	1
more	1
they	1
which	1
receive	1
abundance	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
life	1
by	1
one,	1
Jesus	1
Christ.)	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
judgment	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
condemnation;	1
even	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
one	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
justification	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:19	1
For	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
disobedience	1
many	1
were	1
made	1
sinners,	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
one	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
made	1
righteous.	1
	1
5:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
law	1
entered,	1
that	1
the	1
offence	1
might	1
abound.	1
But	1
where	1
sin	1
abounded,	1
grace	1
did	1
much	1
more	1
abound:	1
5:21	1
That	1
as	1
sin	1
hath	1
reigned	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
so	1
might	1
grace	1
reign	1
through	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Shall	1
we	1
continue	1
in	1
sin,	1
that	1
grace	1
may	1
abound?	1
	1
6:2	1
God	1
forbid.	1
How	1
shall	1
we,	1
that	1
are	1
dead	1
to	1
sin,	1
live	1
any	1
longer	1
therein?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
his	1
death?	1
	1
6:4	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
buried	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
baptism	1
into	1
death:	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
by	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
also	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
planted	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection:	1
6:6	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
serve	1
sin.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
dead	1
is	1
freed	1
from	1
sin.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ,	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
6:9	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Christ	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dieth	1
no	1
more;	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
more	1
dominion	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
died	1
unto	1
sin	1
once:	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
liveth,	1
he	1
liveth	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
Likewise	1
reckon	1
ye	1
also	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
dead	1
indeed	1
unto	1
sin,	1
but	1
alive	1
unto	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:12	1
Let	1
not	1
sin	1
therefore	1
reign	1
in	1
your	1
mortal	1
body,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
obey	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:13	1
Neither	1
yield	1
ye	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
unto	1
sin:	1
but	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
God,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
alive	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
sin	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace.	1
	1
6:15	1
What	1
then?	1
shall	1
we	1
sin,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
servants	1
to	1
obey,	1
his	1
servants	1
ye	1
are	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
obey;	1
whether	1
of	1
sin	1
unto	1
death,	1
or	1
of	1
obedience	1
unto	1
righteousness?	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
God	1
be	1
thanked,	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
obeyed	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
Being	1
then	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
ye	1
became	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:19	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
infirmity	1
of	1
your	1
flesh:	1
for	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
yielded	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
to	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
iniquity;	1
even	1
so	1
now	1
yield	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
when	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
ye	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:21	1
What	1
fruit	1
had	1
ye	1
then	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
are	1
now	1
ashamed?	1
	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
6:22	1
But	1
now	1
being	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
and	1
become	1
servants	1
to	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
your	1
fruit	1
unto	1
holiness,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:1	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
(for	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
the	1
law,)	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
hath	1
dominion	1
over	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth?	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
So	1
then	1
if,	1
while	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth,	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
adulteress:	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
law;	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
adulteress,	1
though	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
7:4	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
become	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
sins,	1
which	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
being	1
dead	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
held;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
oldness	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
7:7	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
Nay,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
sin,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
lust,	1
except	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet.	1
	1
7:8	1
But	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
wrought	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
concupiscence.	1
For	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
once:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
commandment	1
came,	1
sin	1
revived,	1
and	1
I	1
died.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
commandment,	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
to	1
life,	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
slew	1
me.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment	1
holy,	1
and	1
just,	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
7:13	1
Was	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
made	1
death	1
unto	1
me?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
But	1
sin,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
appear	1
sin,	1
working	1
death	1
in	1
me	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
that	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
might	1
become	1
exceeding	1
sinful.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
spiritual:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
carnal,	1
sold	1
under	1
sin.	1
	1
7:15	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
allow	1
not:	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
would,	1
that	1
do	1
I	1
not;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
hate,	1
that	1
do	1
I.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
then	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
I	1
consent	1
unto	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
7:17	1
Now	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
(that	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
flesh,)	1
dwelleth	1
no	1
good	1
thing:	1
for	1
to	1
will	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
how	1
to	1
perform	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
I	1
find	1
not.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
that	1
I	1
do.	1
	1
7:20	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
find	1
then	1
a	1
law,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
good,	1
evil	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
the	1
inward	1
man:	1
7:23	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
another	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
members,	1
warring	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
bringing	1
me	1
into	1
captivity	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
members.	1
	1
7:24	1
O	1
wretched	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
death?	1
	1
7:25	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
So	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
I	1
myself	1
serve	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:1	1
There	1
is	1
therefore	1
now	1
no	1
condemnation	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:2	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
do,	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
weak	1
through	1
the	1
flesh,	1
God	1
sending	1
his	1
own	1
Son	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
sinful	1
flesh,	1
and	1
for	1
sin,	1
condemned	1
sin	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
8:4	1
That	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
us,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
do	1
mind	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
to	1
be	1
carnally	1
minded	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
spiritually	1
minded	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:7	1
Because	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
is	1
enmity	1
against	1
God:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
indeed	1
can	1
be.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
cannot	1
please	1
God.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwell	1
in	1
you.	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
because	1
of	1
sin;	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dwell	1
in	1
you,	1
he	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
also	1
quicken	1
your	1
mortal	1
bodies	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:12	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
debtors,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
do	1
mortify	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:15	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
bondage	1
again	1
to	1
fear;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
adoption,	1
whereby	1
we	1
cry,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
beareth	1
witness	1
with	1
our	1
spirit,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
8:17	1
And	1
if	1
children,	1
then	1
heirs;	1
heirs	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
joint-heirs	1
with	1
Christ;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
suffer	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
also	1
glorified	1
together.	1
	1
8:18	1
For	1
I	1
reckon	1
that	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
are	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
8:19	1
For	1
the	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:20	1
For	1
the	1
creature	1
was	1
made	1
subject	1
to	1
vanity,	1
not	1
willingly,	1
but	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
subjected	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
hope,	1
8:21	1
Because	1
the	1
creature	1
itself	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
corruption	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
groaneth	1
and	1
travaileth	1
in	1
pain	1
together	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
they,	1
but	1
ourselves	1
also,	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
we	1
ourselves	1
groan	1
within	1
ourselves,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
adoption,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
8:24	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
hope:	1
but	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
is	1
not	1
hope:	1
for	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
seeth,	1
why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
hope	1
for?	1
	1
8:25	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
hope	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
not,	1
then	1
do	1
we	1
with	1
patience	1
wait	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
8:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
Spirit	1
also	1
helpeth	1
our	1
infirmities:	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
pray	1
for	1
as	1
we	1
ought:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
groanings	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
uttered.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
searcheth	1
the	1
hearts	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
because	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
saints	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
work	1
together	1
for	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
God,	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
called	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
purpose.	1
	1
8:29	1
For	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
foreknow,	1
he	1
also	1
did	1
predestinate	1
to	1
be	1
conformed	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
firstborn	1
among	1
many	1
brethren.	1
	1
8:30	1
Moreover	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
predestinate,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
called:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
called,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
justified:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
justified,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
glorified.	1
	1
8:31	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
then	1
say	1
to	1
these	1
things?	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
8:32	1
He	1
that	1
spared	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
Son,	1
but	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
freely	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
things?	1
	1
8:33	1
Who	1
shall	1
lay	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
God's	1
elect?	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
justifieth.	1
	1
8:34	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth?	1
It	1
is	1
Christ	1
that	1
died,	1
yea	1
rather,	1
that	1
is	1
risen	1
again,	1
who	1
is	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
8:35	1
Who	1
shall	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
tribulation,	1
or	1
distress,	1
or	1
persecution,	1
or	1
famine,	1
or	1
nakedness,	1
or	1
peril,	1
or	1
sword?	1
	1
8:36	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
thy	1
sake	1
we	1
are	1
killed	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
we	1
are	1
accounted	1
as	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
8:37	1
Nay,	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
we	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
conquerors	1
through	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
8:38	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
that	1
neither	1
death,	1
nor	1
life,	1
nor	1
angels,	1
nor	1
principalities,	1
nor	1
powers,	1
nor	1
things	1
present,	1
nor	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
8:39	1
Nor	1
height,	1
nor	1
depth,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
creature,	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
I	1
lie	1
not,	1
my	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
me	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
9:2	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
heaviness	1
and	1
continual	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
9:3	1
For	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
that	1
myself	1
were	1
accursed	1
from	1
Christ	1
for	1
my	1
brethren,	1
my	1
kinsmen	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:4	1
Who	1
are	1
Israelites;	1
to	1
whom	1
pertaineth	1
the	1
adoption,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
covenants,	1
and	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
promises;	1
9:5	1
Whose	1
are	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
as	1
concerning	1
the	1
flesh	1
Christ	1
came,	1
who	1
is	1
over	1
all,	1
God	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
9:6	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
none	1
effect.	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:7	1
Neither,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
children:	1
but,	1
In	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
9:8	1
That	1
is,	1
They	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
are	1
counted	1
for	1
the	1
seed.	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
promise,	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
this;	1
but	1
when	1
Rebecca	1
also	1
had	1
conceived	1
by	1
one,	1
even	1
by	1
our	1
father	1
Isaac;	1
9:11	1
(For	1
the	1
children	1
being	1
not	1
yet	1
born,	1
neither	1
having	1
done	1
any	1
good	1
or	1
evil,	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
election	1
might	1
stand,	1
not	1
of	1
works,	1
but	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth;)	1
9:12	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Jacob	1
have	1
I	1
loved,	1
but	1
Esau	1
have	1
I	1
hated.	1
	1
9:14	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
there	1
unrighteousness	1
with	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
willeth,	1
nor	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
runneth,	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Even	1
for	1
this	1
same	1
purpose	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
he	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
he	1
hardeneth.	1
	1
9:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then	1
unto	1
me,	1
Why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
find	1
fault?	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
resisted	1
his	1
will?	1
	1
9:20	1
Nay	1
but,	1
O	1
man,	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
repliest	1
against	1
God?	1
Shall	1
the	1
thing	1
formed	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
formed	1
it,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
me	1
thus?	1
	1
9:21	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
potter	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
clay,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
lump	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
and	1
another	1
unto	1
dishonour?	1
	1
9:22	1
What	1
if	1
God,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
power	1
known,	1
endured	1
with	1
much	1
longsuffering	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
wrath	1
fitted	1
to	1
destruction:	1
9:23	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
on	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
mercy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
afore	1
prepared	1
unto	1
glory,	1
9:24	1
Even	1
us,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
called,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
9:25	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
Osee,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
them	1
my	1
people,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
her	1
beloved,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
beloved.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
9:27	1
Esaias	1
also	1
crieth	1
concerning	1
Israel,	1
Though	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
a	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
9:28	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
finish	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
short	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
because	1
a	1
short	1
work	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
Esaias	1
said	1
before,	1
Except	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Sabaoth	1
had	1
left	1
us	1
a	1
seed,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
Sodoma,	1
and	1
been	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
Gomorrha.	1
	1
9:30	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
followed	1
not	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
attained	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
Israel,	1
which	1
followed	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
hath	1
not	1
attained	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
9:32	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
they	1
sought	1
it	1
not	1
by	1
faith,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
For	1
they	1
stumbled	1
at	1
that	1
stumblingstone;	1
9:33	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
stumblingstone	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
offence:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:1	1
Brethren,	1
my	1
heart's	1
desire	1
and	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
Israel	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
them	1
record	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
zeal	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
they	1
being	1
ignorant	1
of	1
God's	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
going	1
about	1
to	1
establish	1
their	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
not	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
righteousness	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
10:5	1
For	1
Moses	1
describeth	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
doeth	1
those	1
things	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith	1
speaketh	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
Say	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
Christ	1
down	1
from	1
above:)	1
10:7	1
Or,	1
Who	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
deep?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
Christ	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.)	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
it?	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
nigh	1
thee,	1
even	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
heart:	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
faith,	1
which	1
we	1
preach;	1
10:9	1
That	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
confess	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shalt	1
believe	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
heart	1
man	1
believeth	1
unto	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mouth	1
confession	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:11	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
the	1
Greek:	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
Lord	1
over	1
all	1
is	1
rich	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:14	1
How	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
believed?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
hear	1
without	1
a	1
preacher?	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
preach,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
sent?	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
How	1
beautiful	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
bring	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
things!	1
	1
10:16	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
obeyed	1
the	1
gospel.	1
For	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
	1
10:17	1
So	1
then	1
faith	1
cometh	1
by	1
hearing,	1
and	1
hearing	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:18	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
heard?	1
Yes	1
verily,	1
their	1
sound	1
went	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Did	1
not	1
Israel	1
know?	1
First	1
Moses	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
provoke	1
you	1
to	1
jealousy	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
people,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
foolish	1
nation	1
I	1
will	1
anger	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
Esaias	1
is	1
very	1
bold,	1
and	1
saith,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not;	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
to	1
Israel	1
he	1
saith,	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
forth	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
a	1
disobedient	1
and	1
gainsaying	1
people.	1
	1
11:1	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Hath	1
God	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
11:2	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people	1
which	1
he	1
foreknew.	1
Wot	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
of	1
Elias?	1
how	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
to	1
God	1
against	1
Israel	1
saying,	1
11:3	1
Lord,	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
digged	1
down	1
thine	1
altars;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
to	1
myself	1
seven	1
thousand	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:5	1
Even	1
so	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
also	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remnant	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
grace.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
if	1
by	1
grace,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
works:	1
otherwise	1
grace	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
works,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace:	1
otherwise	1
work	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
work.	1
	1
11:7	1
What	1
then?	1
Israel	1
hath	1
not	1
obtained	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeketh	1
for;	1
but	1
the	1
election	1
hath	1
obtained	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
blinded.	1
	1
11:8	1
(According	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
slumber,	1
eyes	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
ears	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear;)	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
David	1
saith,	1
Let	1
their	1
table	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
a	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
unto	1
them:	1
11:10	1
Let	1
their	1
eyes	1
be	1
darkened,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
their	1
back	1
alway.	1
	1
11:11	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Have	1
they	1
stumbled	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
but	1
rather	1
through	1
their	1
fall	1
salvation	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
for	1
to	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
	1
11:12	1
Now	1
if	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
diminishing	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
their	1
fulness?	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
I	1
magnify	1
mine	1
office:	1
11:14	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
may	1
provoke	1
to	1
emulation	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
might	1
save	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
casting	1
away	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
reconciling	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
them	1
be,	1
but	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
11:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
firstfruit	1
be	1
holy,	1
the	1
lump	1
is	1
also	1
holy:	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
root	1
be	1
holy,	1
so	1
are	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
be	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
wild	1
olive	1
tree,	1
wert	1
graffed	1
in	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
partakest	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree;	1
11:18	1
Boast	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
branches.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
boast,	1
thou	1
bearest	1
not	1
the	1
root,	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
thee.	1
	1
11:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then,	1
The	1
branches	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
graffed	1
in.	1
	1
11:20	1
Well;	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou	1
standest	1
by	1
faith.	1
Be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
but	1
fear:	1
11:21	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
also	1
spare	1
not	1
thee.	1
	1
11:22	1
Behold	1
therefore	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
severity	1
of	1
God:	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
fell,	1
severity;	1
but	1
toward	1
thee,	1
goodness,	1
if	1
thou	1
continue	1
in	1
his	1
goodness:	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
they	1
also,	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
not	1
still	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
shall	1
be	1
graffed	1
in:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
graff	1
them	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
wild	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
wert	1
graffed	1
contrary	1
to	1
nature	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
olive	1
tree:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
these,	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
be	1
graffed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
olive	1
tree?	1
	1
11:25	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
mystery,	1
lest	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits;	1
that	1
blindness	1
in	1
part	1
is	1
happened	1
to	1
Israel,	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
so	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Sion	1
the	1
Deliverer,	1
and	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
ungodliness	1
from	1
Jacob:	1
11:27	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
unto	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
11:28	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
gospel,	1
they	1
are	1
enemies	1
for	1
your	1
sakes:	1
but	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
election,	1
they	1
are	1
beloved	1
for	1
the	1
father's	1
sakes.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
the	1
gifts	1
and	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
without	1
repentance.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
have	1
not	1
believed	1
God,	1
yet	1
have	1
now	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
through	1
their	1
unbelief:	1
11:31	1
Even	1
so	1
have	1
these	1
also	1
now	1
not	1
believed,	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
mercy	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
11:32	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
concluded	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
all.	1
	1
11:33	1
O	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
riches	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
how	1
unsearchable	1
are	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
past	1
finding	1
out!	1
	1
11:34	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
his	1
counsellor?	1
	1
11:35	1
Or	1
who	1
hath	1
first	1
given	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
him	1
again?	1
	1
11:36	1
For	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
are	1
all	1
things:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
12:1	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
present	1
your	1
bodies	1
a	1
living	1
sacrifice,	1
holy,	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
reasonable	1
service.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
conformed	1
to	1
this	1
world:	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
transformed	1
by	1
the	1
renewing	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prove	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
good,	1
and	1
acceptable,	1
and	1
perfect,	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
I	1
say,	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
himself	1
more	1
highly	1
than	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
soberly,	1
according	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
12:4	1
For	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
members	1
in	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
members	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
office:	1
12:5	1
So	1
we,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
then	1
gifts	1
differing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
us,	1
whether	1
prophecy,	1
let	1
us	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
faith;	1
12:7	1
Or	1
ministry,	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
on	1
our	1
ministering:	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
teacheth,	1
on	1
teaching;	1
12:8	1
Or	1
he	1
that	1
exhorteth,	1
on	1
exhortation:	1
he	1
that	1
giveth,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
simplicity;	1
he	1
that	1
ruleth,	1
with	1
diligence;	1
he	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy,	1
with	1
cheerfulness.	1
	1
12:9	1
Let	1
love	1
be	1
without	1
dissimulation.	1
Abhor	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil;	1
cleave	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
12:10	1
Be	1
kindly	1
affectioned	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
brotherly	1
love;	1
in	1
honour	1
preferring	1
one	1
another;	1
12:11	1
Not	1
slothful	1
in	1
business;	1
fervent	1
in	1
spirit;	1
serving	1
the	1
Lord;	1
12:12	1
Rejoicing	1
in	1
hope;	1
patient	1
in	1
tribulation;	1
continuing	1
instant	1
in	1
prayer;	1
12:13	1
Distributing	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saints;	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality.	1
	1
12:14	1
Bless	1
them	1
which	1
persecute	1
you:	1
bless,	1
and	1
curse	1
not.	1
	1
12:15	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
weep	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
weep.	1
	1
12:16	1
Be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
one	1
toward	1
another.	1
Mind	1
not	1
high	1
things,	1
but	1
condescend	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
estate.	1
Be	1
not	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits.	1
	1
12:17	1
Recompense	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
evil	1
for	1
evil.	1
Provide	1
things	1
honest	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:18	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
lieth	1
in	1
you,	1
live	1
peaceably	1
with	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:19	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
avenge	1
not	1
yourselves,	1
but	1
rather	1
give	1
place	1
unto	1
wrath:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
mine;	1
I	1
will	1
repay,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:20	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thine	1
enemy	1
hunger,	1
feed	1
him;	1
if	1
he	1
thirst,	1
give	1
him	1
drink:	1
for	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heap	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
12:21	1
Be	1
not	1
overcome	1
of	1
evil,	1
but	1
overcome	1
evil	1
with	1
good.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
every	1
soul	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
the	1
higher	1
powers.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
but	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
be	1
are	1
ordained	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:2	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
resisteth	1
the	1
power,	1
resisteth	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
resist	1
shall	1
receive	1
to	1
themselves	1
damnation.	1
	1
13:3	1
For	1
rulers	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
good	1
works,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
power?	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
13:4	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
good.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
be	1
afraid;	1
for	1
he	1
beareth	1
not	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
a	1
revenger	1
to	1
execute	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil.	1
	1
13:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
subject,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
wrath,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
13:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
pay	1
ye	1
tribute	1
also:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
God's	1
ministers,	1
attending	1
continually	1
upon	1
this	1
very	1
thing.	1
	1
13:7	1
Render	1
therefore	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
dues:	1
tribute	1
to	1
whom	1
tribute	1
is	1
due;	1
custom	1
to	1
whom	1
custom;	1
fear	1
to	1
whom	1
fear;	1
honour	1
to	1
whom	1
honour.	1
	1
13:8	1
Owe	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
thing,	1
but	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
another	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
commandment,	1
it	1
is	1
briefly	1
comprehended	1
in	1
this	1
saying,	1
namely,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
13:10	1
Love	1
worketh	1
no	1
ill	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
therefore	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
that,	1
knowing	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
awake	1
out	1
of	1
sleep:	1
for	1
now	1
is	1
our	1
salvation	1
nearer	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
believed.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
night	1
is	1
far	1
spent,	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
let	1
us	1
therefore	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
walk	1
honestly,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day;	1
not	1
in	1
rioting	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
not	1
in	1
chambering	1
and	1
wantonness,	1
not	1
in	1
strife	1
and	1
envying.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
put	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
not	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
14:1	1
Him	1
that	1
is	1
weak	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
receive	1
ye,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
doubtful	1
disputations.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
one	1
believeth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
all	1
things:	1
another,	1
who	1
is	1
weak,	1
eateth	1
herbs.	1
	1
14:3	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
despise	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
not;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
him	1
which	1
eateth	1
not	1
judge	1
him	1
that	1
eateth:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
14:4	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another	1
man's	1
servant?	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
he	1
standeth	1
or	1
falleth.	1
Yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holden	1
up:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
stand.	1
	1
14:5	1
One	1
man	1
esteemeth	1
one	1
day	1
above	1
another:	1
another	1
esteemeth	1
every	1
day	1
alike.	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
that	1
regardeth	1
the	1
day,	1
regardeth	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
day,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
regard	1
it.	1
He	1
that	1
eateth,	1
eateth	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
not,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
eateth	1
not,	1
and	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
liveth	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
dieth	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
live,	1
we	1
live	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whether	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
die	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
whether	1
we	1
live	1
therefore,	1
or	1
die,	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
Lord's.	1
	1
14:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
Christ	1
both	1
died,	1
and	1
rose,	1
and	1
revived,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
Lord	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
living.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
brother?	1
or	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
thy	1
brother?	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
confess	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:12	1
So	1
then	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:13	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
therefore	1
judge	1
one	1
another	1
any	1
more:	1
but	1
judge	1
this	1
rather,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
or	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
his	1
brother's	1
way.	1
	1
14:14	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
unclean	1
of	1
itself:	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
esteemeth	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
unclean,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
14:15	1
But	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
grieved	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
now	1
walkest	1
thou	1
not	1
charitably.	1
Destroy	1
not	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died.	1
	1
14:16	1
Let	1
not	1
then	1
your	1
good	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of:	1
14:17	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
meat	1
and	1
drink;	1
but	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:18	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
serveth	1
Christ	1
is	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
approved	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:19	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
make	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
things	1
wherewith	1
one	1
may	1
edify	1
another.	1
	1
14:20	1
For	1
meat	1
destroy	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God.	1
All	1
things	1
indeed	1
are	1
pure;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evil	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
who	1
eateth	1
with	1
offence.	1
	1
14:21	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
neither	1
to	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
whereby	1
thy	1
brother	1
stumbleth,	1
or	1
is	1
offended,	1
or	1
is	1
made	1
weak.	1
	1
14:22	1
Hast	1
thou	1
faith?	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
thyself	1
before	1
God.	1
Happy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth	1
not	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
alloweth.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
doubteth	1
is	1
damned	1
if	1
he	1
eat,	1
because	1
he	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
15:1	1
We	1
then	1
that	1
are	1
strong	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
infirmities	1
of	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
please	1
ourselves.	1
	1
15:2	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
please	1
his	1
neighbour	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
to	1
edification.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
pleased	1
not	1
himself;	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
reproaches	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
reproached	1
thee	1
fell	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
aforetime	1
were	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
learning,	1
that	1
we	1
through	1
patience	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures	1
might	1
have	1
hope.	1
	1
15:5	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
consolation	1
grant	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
likeminded	1
one	1
toward	1
another	1
according	1
to	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
15:6	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
and	1
one	1
mouth	1
glorify	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:7	1
Wherefore	1
receive	1
ye	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
received	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:8	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
a	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
promises	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers:	1
15:9	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
mercy;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
sing	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith,	1
Rejoice,	1
ye	1
Gentiles,	1
with	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
again,	1
Praise	1
the	1
Lord,	1
all	1
ye	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
laud	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
again,	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
15:13	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hope	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
believing,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
hope,	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
persuaded	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
goodness,	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
admonish	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:15	1
Nevertheless,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
as	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
mind,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
God,	1
15:16	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
ministering	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
offering	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
be	1
acceptable,	1
being	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
whereof	1
I	1
may	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
pertain	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
15:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Christ	1
hath	1
not	1
wrought	1
by	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
obedient,	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
15:19	1
Through	1
mighty	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God;	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Illyricum,	1
I	1
have	1
fully	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:20	1
Yea,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
strived	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
not	1
where	1
Christ	1
was	1
named,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
upon	1
another	1
man's	1
foundation:	1
15:21	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
spoken	1
of,	1
they	1
shall	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
hindered	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
now	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
place	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
15:24	1
Whensoever	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
journey	1
into	1
Spain,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
thitherward	1
by	1
you,	1
if	1
first	1
I	1
be	1
somewhat	1
filled	1
with	1
your	1
company.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
15:26	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
certain	1
contribution	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:27	1
It	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
verily;	1
and	1
their	1
debtors	1
they	1
are.	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
their	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
their	1
duty	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
carnal	1
things.	1
	1
15:28	1
When	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
this,	1
and	1
have	1
sealed	1
to	1
them	1
this	1
fruit,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Spain.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:30	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
strive	1
together	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
prayers	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
me;	1
15:31	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
the	1
saints;	1
15:32	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
joy	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
may	1
with	1
you	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
15:33	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:1	1
I	1
commend	1
unto	1
you	1
Phebe	1
our	1
sister,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Cenchrea:	1
16:2	1
That	1
ye	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
assist	1
her	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
business	1
she	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
succourer	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
of	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
16:3	1
Greet	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila	1
my	1
helpers	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
16:4	1
Who	1
have	1
for	1
my	1
life	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
own	1
necks:	1
unto	1
whom	1
not	1
only	1
I	1
give	1
thanks,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
16:5	1
Likewise	1
greet	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
Salute	1
my	1
well-beloved	1
Epaenetus,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia	1
unto	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:6	1
Greet	1
Mary,	1
who	1
bestowed	1
much	1
labour	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
16:7	1
Salute	1
Andronicus	1
and	1
Junia,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
and	1
my	1
fellow-prisoners,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
note	1
among	1
the	1
apostles,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
Christ	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
16:8	1
Greet	1
Amplias	1
my	1
beloved	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:9	1
Salute	1
Urbane,	1
our	1
helper	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Stachys	1
my	1
beloved.	1
	1
16:10	1
Salute	1
Apelles	1
approved	1
in	1
Christ.	1
Salute	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Aristobulus'	1
household.	1
	1
16:11	1
Salute	1
Herodion	1

kinsman.	1
Greet	1

the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:12	1
Salute	1
Tryphena	1
and	1
Tryphosa,	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Salute	1
the	1

laboured	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:13	1
Salute	1
Rufus	1
chosen	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1

	1
16:14	1
Salute	1
Asyncritus,	1
Phlegon,	1
Hermas,	1

and	1
the	1

them.	1
	1
16:15	1
Salute	1
Philologus,	1

Julia,	1
Nereus,	1
and	1
his	1
sister,	1

Olympas,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:16	1
Salute	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Christ	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:17	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
cause	1
divisions	1
and	1
offences	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
learned;	1
and	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
serve	1
not	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
belly;	1
and	1
by	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
fair	1
speeches	1
deceive	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
16:19	1
For	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
come	1
abroad	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
behalf:	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
wise	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
simple	1
concerning	1
evil.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
bruise	1
Satan	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
shortly.	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:21	1
Timotheus	1
my	1
workfellow,	1
and	1
Lucius,	1
and	1
Jason,	1
and	1
Sosipater,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:22	1
I	1
Tertius,	1
who	1
wrote	1
this	1
epistle,	1
salute	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:23	1
Gaius	1
mine	1
host,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
saluteth	1
you.	1
Erastus	1
the	1
chamberlain	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Quartus	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
16:24	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:25	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
stablish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
was	1
kept	1
secret	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
16:26	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
faith:	1
16:27	1
To	1
God	1
only	1
wise,	1
be	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
through	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Sosthenes	1
our	1
brother,	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
both	1
their's	1
and	1
our's:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
behalf,	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:5	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
ye	1
are	1
enriched	1
by	1
him,	1
in	1
all	1
utterance,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Christ	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
you:	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
behind	1
in	1
no	1
gift;	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Who	1
shall	1
also	1
confirm	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
speak	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
perfectly	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
judgment.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
declared	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
by	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Chloe,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
contentions	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
1:12	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Cephas;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
Is	1
Christ	1
divided?	1
was	1
Paul	1
crucified	1
for	1
you?	1
or	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Paul?	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
baptized	1
none	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
Crispus	1
and	1
Gaius;	1
1:15	1
Lest	1
any	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
baptized	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
name.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
baptized	1
also	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Stephanas:	1
besides,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
I	1
baptized	1
any	1
other.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
Christ	1
sent	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
baptize,	1
but	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel:	1
not	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
words,	1
lest	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
perish	1
foolishness;	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
nothing	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
prudent.	1
	1
1:20	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
wise?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
disputer	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
hath	1
not	1
God	1
made	1
foolish	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
after	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
wisdom	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
it	1
pleased	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
preaching	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
1:22	1
For	1
the	1
Jews	1
require	1
a	1
sign,	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks	1
seek	1
after	1
wisdom:	1
1:23	1
But	1
we	1
preach	1
Christ	1
crucified,	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Greeks	1
foolishness;	1
1:24	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
called,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks,	1
Christ	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
Because	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
wiser	1
than	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
ye	1
see	1
your	1
calling,	1
brethren,	1
how	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
wise	1
men	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
not	1
many	1
mighty,	1
not	1
many	1
noble,	1
are	1
called:	1
1:27	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
wise;	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
weak	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
mighty;	1
1:28	1
And	1
base	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
despised,	1
hath	1
God	1
chosen,	1
yea,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
nought	1
things	1
that	1
are:	1
1:29	1
That	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
us	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sanctification,	1
and	1
redemption:	1
1:31	1
That,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
came	1
not	1
with	1
excellency	1
of	1
speech	1
or	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
declaring	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
I	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
among	1
you,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
him	1
crucified.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
weakness,	1
and	1
in	1
fear,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
my	1
speech	1
and	1
my	1
preaching	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
enticing	1
words	1
of	1
man's	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
in	1
demonstration	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
of	1
power:	1
2:5	1
That	1
your	1
faith	1
should	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:6	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
speak	1
wisdom	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
perfect:	1
yet	1
not	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
speak	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
mystery,	1
even	1
the	1
hidden	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
God	1
ordained	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
our	1
glory:	1
2:8	1
Which	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
knew:	1
for	1
had	1
they	1
known	1
it,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Eye	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
nor	1
ear	1
heard,	1
neither	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
searcheth	1
all	1
things,	1
yea,	1
the	1
deep	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
what	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
save	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him?	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
we	1
have	1
received,	1
not	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
freely	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:13	1
Which	1
things	1
also	1
we	1
speak,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
teacheth,	1
but	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
teacheth;	1
comparing	1
spiritual	1
things	1
with	1
spiritual.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
receiveth	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
foolishness	1
unto	1
him:	1
neither	1
can	1
he	1
know	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
spiritually	1
discerned.	1
	1
2:15	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
spiritual	1
judgeth	1
all	1
things,	1
yet	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
instruct	1
him?	1
	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
as	1
unto	1
carnal,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
babes	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:2	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
meat:	1
for	1
hitherto	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it,	1
neither	1
yet	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
able.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
carnal:	1
for	1
whereas	1
there	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
envying,	1
and	1
strife,	1
and	1
divisions,	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal,	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
men?	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
while	1
one	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
another,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal?	1
	1
3:5	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
Paul,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Apollos,	1
but	1
ministers	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
believed,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
to	1
every	1
man?	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
planted,	1
Apollos	1
watered;	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:7	1
So	1
then	1
neither	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
any	1
thing,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
watereth;	1
but	1
God	1
that	1
giveth	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watereth	1
are	1
one:	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
his	1
own	1
reward	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
labour.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
labourers	1
together	1
with	1
God:	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
husbandry,	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
building.	1
	1
3:10	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
wise	1
masterbuilder,	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
another	1
buildeth	1
thereon.	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
take	1
heed	1
how	1
he	1
buildeth	1
thereupon.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
other	1
foundation	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
lay	1
than	1
that	1
is	1
laid,	1
which	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
build	1
upon	1
this	1
foundation	1
gold,	1
silver,	1
precious	1
stones,	1
wood,	1
hay,	1
stubble;	1
3:13	1
Every	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
by	1
fire;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
try	1
every	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
3:14	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
abide	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
thereupon,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
reward.	1
	1
3:15	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
burned,	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
loss:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
yet	1
so	1
as	1
by	1
fire.	1
	1
3:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you?	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
defile	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
him	1
shall	1
God	1
destroy;	1
for	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
holy,	1
which	1
temple	1
ye	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
himself.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
let	1
him	1
become	1
a	1
fool,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
wise.	1
	1
3:19	1
For	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
foolishness	1
with	1
God.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
taketh	1
the	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
craftiness.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
3:21	1
Therefore	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
men.	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:22	1
Whether	1
Paul,	1
or	1
Apollos,	1
or	1
Cephas,	1
or	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
life,	1
or	1
death,	1
or	1
things	1
present,	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
all	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:23	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
Christ's;	1
and	1
Christ	1
is	1
God's.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
account	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:2	1
Moreover	1
it	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
stewards,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
faithful.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
you,	1
or	1
of	1
man's	1
judgment:	1
yea,	1
I	1
judge	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
self.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
by	1
myself;	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
hereby	1
justified:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
judgeth	1
me	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
judge	1
nothing	1
before	1
the	1
time,	1
until	1
the	1
Lord	1
come,	1
who	1
both	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
manifest	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
hearts:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
these	1
things,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
figure	1
transferred	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
Apollos	1
for	1
your	1
sakes;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
learn	1
in	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
men	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
puffed	1
up	1
for	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
who	1
maketh	1
thee	1
to	1
differ	1
from	1
another?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
receive?	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
didst	1
receive	1
it,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
glory,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
received	1
it?	1
	1
4:8	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
full,	1
now	1
ye	1
are	1
rich,	1
ye	1
have	1
reigned	1
as	1
kings	1
without	1
us:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
did	1
reign,	1
that	1
we	1
also	1
might	1
reign	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:9	1
For	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
last,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
a	1
spectacle	1
unto	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to	1
angels,	1
and	1
to	1
men.	1
	1
4:10	1
We	1
are	1
fools	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
Christ;	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
strong;	1
ye	1
are	1
honourable,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
despised.	1
	1
4:11	1
Even	1
unto	1
this	1
present	1
hour	1
we	1
both	1
hunger,	1
and	1
thirst,	1
and	1
are	1
naked,	1
and	1
are	1
buffeted,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
dwellingplace;	1
4:12	1
And	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands:	1
being	1
reviled,	1
we	1
bless;	1
being	1
persecuted,	1
we	1
suffer	1
it:	1
4:13	1
Being	1
defamed,	1
we	1
intreat:	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
as	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
offscouring	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
write	1
not	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
shame	1
you,	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
beloved	1
sons	1
I	1
warn	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
though	1
ye	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
instructers	1
in	1
Christ,	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
many	1
fathers:	1
for	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
4:16	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
Timotheus,	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
son,	1
and	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
remembrance	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
as	1
I	1
teach	1
every	1
where	1
in	1
every	1
church.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
some	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
shortly,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
and	1
will	1
know,	1
not	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
but	1
in	1
power.	1
	1
4:21	1
What	1
will	1
ye?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
or	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness?	1
	1
5:1	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
commonly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
fornication	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
such	1
fornication	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
named	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
his	1
father's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
rather	1
mourned,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
deed	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
verily,	1
as	1
absent	1
in	1
body,	1
but	1
present	1
in	1
spirit,	1
have	1
judged	1
already,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
so	1
done	1
this	1
deed,	1
5:4	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit,	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:5	1
To	1
deliver	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
unto	1
Satan	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
may	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:6	1
Your	1
glorying	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump?	1
	1
5:7	1
Purge	1
out	1
therefore	1
the	1
old	1
leaven,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
lump,	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
unleavened.	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
our	1
passover	1
is	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
us:	1
5:8	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
with	1
old	1
leaven,	1
neither	1
with	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
wickedness;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
of	1
sincerity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
5:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
epistle	1
not	1
to	1
company	1
with	1
fornicators:	1
5:10	1
Yet	1
not	1
altogether	1
with	1
the	1
fornicators	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
covetous,	1
or	1
extortioners,	1
or	1
with	1
idolaters;	1
for	1
then	1
must	1
ye	1
needs	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
brother	1
be	1
a	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
covetous,	1
or	1
an	1
idolater,	1
or	1
a	1
railer,	1
or	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
or	1
an	1
extortioner;	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
no	1
not	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
without?	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
judge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
within?	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
God	1
judgeth.	1
Therefore	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves	1
that	1
wicked	1
person.	1
	1
6:1	1
Dare	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
another,	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
before	1
the	1
unjust,	1
and	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
saints?	1
	1
6:2	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
you,	1
are	1
ye	1
unworthy	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
smallest	1
matters?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
judge	1
angels?	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
this	1
life?	1
6:4	1
If	1
then	1
ye	1
have	1
judgments	1
of	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
this	1
life,	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
judge	1
who	1
are	1
least	1
esteemed	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
6:5	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
Is	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
among	1
you?	1
no,	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
between	1
his	1
brethren?	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
brother	1
goeth	1
to	1
law	1
with	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
utterly	1
a	1
fault	1
among	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
take	1
wrong?	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
defrauded?	1
	1
6:8	1
Nay,	1
ye	1
do	1
wrong,	1
and	1
defraud,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
brethren.	1
	1
6:9	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
neither	1
fornicators,	1
nor	1
idolaters,	1
nor	1
adulterers,	1
nor	1
effeminate,	1
nor	1
abusers	1
of	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
6:10	1
Nor	1
thieves,	1
nor	1
covetous,	1
nor	1
drunkards,	1
nor	1
revilers,	1
nor	1
extortioners,	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
such	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
washed,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
sanctified,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
under	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any.	1
	1
6:13	1
Meats	1
for	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
the	1
belly	1
for	1
meats:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
destroy	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
them.	1
Now	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
fornication,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
both	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
will	1
also	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
6:15	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
bodies	1
are	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
an	1
harlot?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
an	1
harlot	1
is	1
one	1
body?	1
	1
for	1
two,	1
saith	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
one	1
spirit.	1
	1
6:18	1
Flee	1
fornication.	1
Every	1
sin	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
fornication	1
sinneth	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
6:19	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price:	1
therefore	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
spirit,	1
which	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
wrote	1
unto	1
me:	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
7:2	1
Nevertheless,	1
to	1
avoid	1
fornication,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
woman	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
Let	1
the	1
husband	1
render	1
unto	1
the	1
wife	1
due	1
benevolence:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
husband.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
wife	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
husband:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
husband	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
wife.	1
	1
7:5	1
Defraud	1
ye	1
not	1
one	1
the	1
other,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
consent	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
give	1
yourselves	1
to	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer;	1
and	1
come	1
together	1
again,	1
that	1
Satan	1
tempt	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
incontinency.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
by	1
permission,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
commandment.	1
	1
7:7	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
myself.	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
his	1
proper	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
one	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
say	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
unmarried	1
and	1
widows,	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
even	1
as	1
I.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
contain,	1
let	1
them	1
marry:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
marry	1
than	1
to	1
burn.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
married	1
I	1
command,	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wife	1
depart	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
7:11	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
depart,	1
let	1
her	1
remain	1
unmarried	1
or	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
husband	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
speak	1
I,	1
not	1
the	1
Lord:	1
If	1
any	1
brother	1
hath	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
her,	1
let	1
her	1
not	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
husband	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
wife	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
husband:	1
else	1
were	1
your	1
children	1
unclean;	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
holy.	1
	1
7:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
depart,	1
let	1
him	1
depart.	1
A	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
sister	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
bondage	1
in	1
such	1
cases:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
peace.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
what	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
wife,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
husband?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
man,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
every	1
man,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
called	1
every	1
one,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
walk.	1
And	1
so	1
ordain	1
I	1
in	1
all	1
churches.	1
	1
7:18	1
Is	1
any	1
man	1
called	1
being	1
circumcised?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
become	1
uncircumcised.	1
Is	1
any	1
called	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
7:19	1
Circumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
but	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
calling	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
called.	1
	1
7:21	1
Art	1
thou	1
called	1
being	1
a	1
servant?	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
made	1
free,	1
use	1
it	1
rather.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
being	1
a	1
servant,	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
freeman:	1
likewise	1
also	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called,	1
being	1
free,	1
is	1
Christ's	1
servant.	1
	1
7:23	1
Ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price;	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:24	1
Brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man,	1
wherein	1
he	1
is	1
called,	1
therein	1
abide	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
Now	1
concerning	1
virgins	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
judgment,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
be	1
faithful.	1
	1
7:26	1
I	1
suppose	1
therefore	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
distress,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
7:27	1
Art	1
thou	1
bound	1
unto	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
loosed.	1
Art	1
thou	1
loosed	1
from	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
wife.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
marry,	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sinned;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
virgin	1
marry,	1
she	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned.	1
Nevertheless	1
such	1
shall	1
have	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
but	1
I	1
spare	1
you.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
short:	1
it	1
remaineth,	1
that	1
both	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
wives	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
none;	1
7:30	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
weep,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
wept	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
rejoice,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
buy,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
possessed	1
not;	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
use	1
this	1
world,	1
as	1
not	1
abusing	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
passeth	1
away.	1
	1
7:32	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
without	1
carefulness.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
Lord:	1
7:33	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:34	1
There	1
is	1
difference	1
also	1
between	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
virgin.	1
The	1
unmarried	1
woman	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
holy	1
both	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
spirit:	1
but	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
she	1
may	1
please	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
profit;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
you,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
comely,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
attend	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
without	1
distraction.	1
	1
7:36	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
behaveth	1
himself	1
uncomely	1
toward	1
his	1
virgin,	1
if	1
she	1
pass	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
her	1
age,	1
and	1
need	1
so	1
require,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
he	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
let	1
them	1
marry.	1
	1
7:37	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
that	1
standeth	1
stedfast	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
having	1
no	1
necessity,	1
but	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
hath	1
so	1
decreed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
virgin,	1
doeth	1
well.	1
	1
7:38	1
So	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
well;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
not	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
better.	1
	1
7:39	1
The	1
wife	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
will;	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:40	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
happier	1
if	1
she	1
so	1
abide,	1
after	1
my	1
judgment:	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
as	1
touching	1
things	1
offered	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
knowledge.	1
Knowledge	1
puffeth	1
up,	1
but	1
charity	1
edifieth.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
knoweth	1
any	1
thing,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
nothing	1
yet	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
know.	1
	1
8:3	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
As	1
concerning	1
therefore	1
the	1
eating	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
idol	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
God	1
but	1
one.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
though	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
gods,	1
whether	1
in	1
heaven	1
or	1
in	1
earth,	1
(as	1
there	1
be	1
gods	1
many,	1
and	1
lords	1
many,)	1
8:6	1
But	1
to	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
God,	1
the	1
Father,	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
one	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
knowledge:	1
for	1
some	1
with	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
idol	1
unto	1
this	1
hour	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
offered	1
unto	1
an	1
idol;	1
and	1
their	1
conscience	1
being	1
weak	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
8:8	1
But	1
meat	1
commendeth	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
for	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
better;	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat	1
not,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
this	1
liberty	1
of	1
your's	1
become	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weak.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
thee	1
which	1
hast	1
knowledge	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
idol's	1
temple,	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
weak	1
be	1
emboldened	1
to	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
to	1
idols;	1
8:11	1
And	1
through	1
thy	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
weak	1
brother	1
perish,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died?	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
sin	1
so	1
against	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wound	1
their	1
weak	1
conscience,	1
ye	1
sin	1
against	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:13	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
meat	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend,	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
no	1
flesh	1
while	1
the	1
world	1
standeth,	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend.	1
	1
9:1	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
an	1
apostle?	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord?	1
are	1
not	1
ye	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
9:2	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
an	1
apostle	1
unto	1
others,	1
yet	1
doubtless	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
mine	1
apostleship	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:3	1
Mine	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
examine	1
me	1
is	1
this,	1
9:4	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink?	1
	1
9:5	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
lead	1
about	1
a	1
sister,	1
a	1
wife,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
other	1
apostles,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
Cephas?	1
	1
9:6	1
Or	1
I	1
only	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
have	1
not	1
we	1
power	1
to	1
forbear	1
working?	1
	1
9:7	1
Who	1
goeth	1
a	1
warfare	1
any	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
charges?	1
who	1
planteth	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof?	1
or	1
who	1
feedeth	1
a	1
flock,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
flock?	1
	1
9:8	1
Say	1
I	1
these	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
man?	1
or	1
saith	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
the	1
same	1
also?	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
Doth	1
God	1
take	1
care	1
for	1
oxen?	1
	1
9:10	1
Or	1
saith	1
he	1
it	1
altogether	1
for	1
our	1
sakes?	1
For	1
our	1
sakes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
this	1
is	1
written:	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
ploweth	1
should	1
plow	1
in	1
hope;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
thresheth	1
in	1
hope	1
should	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
hope.	1
	1
9:11	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
sown	1
unto	1
you	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
reap	1
your	1
carnal	1
things?	1
	1
9:12	1
If	1
others	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
over	1
you,	1
are	1
not	1
we	1
rather?	1
	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
used	1
this	1
power;	1
but	1
suffer	1
all	1
things,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
hinder	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:13	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
minister	1
about	1
holy	1
things	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
temple?	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
are	1
partakers	1
with	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
9:14	1
Even	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
ordained	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
should	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die,	1
than	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
make	1
my	1
glorying	1
void.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
glory	1
of:	1
for	1
necessity	1
is	1
laid	1
upon	1
me;	1
yea,	1
woe	1
is	1
unto	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
preach	1
not	1
the	1
gospel!	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
willingly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
reward:	1
but	1
if	1
against	1
my	1
will,	1
a	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:18	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
then?	1
Verily	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
without	1
charge,	1
that	1
I	1
abuse	1
not	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
men,	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
servant	1
unto	1
all,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
Jew,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
Jews;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law;	1
9:21	1
To	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law,	1
as	1
without	1
law,	1
(being	1
not	1
without	1
law	1
to	1
God,	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
Christ,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law.	1
	1
9:22	1
To	1
the	1
weak	1
became	1
I	1
as	1
weak,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
weak:	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
save	1
some.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
gospel's	1
sake,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
partaker	1
thereof	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:24	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
race	1
run	1
all,	1
but	1
one	1
receiveth	1
the	1
prize?	1
So	1
run,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
obtain.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
striveth	1
for	1
the	1
mastery	1
is	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
Now	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
corruptible	1
crown;	1
but	1
we	1
an	1
incorruptible.	1
	1
9:26	1
I	1
therefore	1
so	1
run,	1
not	1
as	1
uncertainly;	1
so	1
fight	1
I,	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
beateth	1
the	1
air:	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
keep	1
under	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
subjection:	1
lest	1
that	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
others,	1
I	1
myself	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
castaway.	1
	1
10:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
how	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
fathers	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
all	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:2	1
And	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:3	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
meat;	1
10:4	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
drink	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
drink:	1
for	1
they	1
drank	1
of	1
that	1
spiritual	1
Rock	1
that	1
followed	1
them:	1
and	1
that	1
Rock	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
10:5	1
But	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
God	1
was	1
not	1
well	1
pleased:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
overthrown	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
10:6	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
our	1
examples,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
lust	1
after	1
evil	1
things,	1
as	1
they	1
also	1
lusted.	1
	1
10:7	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
idolaters,	1
as	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
them;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
10:8	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
committed,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
	1
10:9	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
tempt	1
Christ,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
tempted,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
serpents.	1
	1
10:10	1
Neither	1
murmur	1
ye,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
murmured,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
destroyer.	1
	1
10:11	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
ensamples:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
admonition,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
thinketh	1
he	1
standeth	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
fall.	1
	1
10:13	1
There	1
hath	1
no	1
temptation	1
taken	1
you	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
common	1
to	1
man:	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
above	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
able;	1
but	1
will	1
with	1
the	1
temptation	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
escape,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:14	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
flee	1
from	1
idolatry.	1
	1
10:15	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
to	1
wise	1
men;	1
judge	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
cup	1
of	1
blessing	1
which	1
we	1
bless,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ?	1
The	1
bread	1
which	1
we	1
break,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ?	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
we	1
being	1
many	1
are	1
one	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
body:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
partakers	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
bread.	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold	1
Israel	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
which	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
10:19	1
What	1
say	1
I	1
then?	1
that	1
the	1
idol	1
is	1
any	1
thing,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
idols	1
is	1
any	1
thing?	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
sacrifice,	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
devils,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
10:21	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
drink	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
devils:	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Lord's	1
table,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
devils.	1
	1
10:22	1
Do	1
we	1
provoke	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
jealousy?	1
are	1
we	1
stronger	1
than	1
he?	1
10:23	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
edify	1
not.	1
	1
10:24	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
seek	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
another's	1
wealth.	1
	1
10:25	1
Whatsoever	1
is	1
sold	1
in	1
the	1
shambles,	1
that	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
10:26	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
10:27	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not	1
bid	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
go;	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
10:28	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
eat	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
that	1
shewed	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof:	1
10:29	1
Conscience,	1
I	1
say,	1
not	1
thine	1
own,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
why	1
is	1
my	1
liberty	1
judged	1
of	1
another	1
man's	1
conscience?	1
	1
10:30	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
grace	1
be	1
a	1
partaker,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
thanks?	1
	1
10:31	1
Whether	1
therefore	1
ye	1
eat,	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Give	1
none	1
offence,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God:	1
10:33	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
not	1
seeking	1
mine	1
own	1
profit,	1
but	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
many,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
I	1
praise	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
ordinances,	1
as	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:4	1
Every	1
man	1
praying	1
or	1
prophesying,	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
dishonoureth	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
11:5	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
prayeth	1
or	1
prophesieth	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
uncovered	1
dishonoureth	1
her	1
head:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
all	1
one	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
shaven.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
covered,	1
let	1
her	1
also	1
be	1
shorn:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
shorn	1
or	1
shaven,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
covered.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
a	1
man	1
indeed	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
head,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:8	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
woman:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:9	1
Neither	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
created	1
for	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
ought	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
11:11	1
Nevertheless	1
neither	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
the	1
woman,	1
neither	1
the	1
woman	1
without	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:13	1
Judge	1
in	1
yourselves:	1
is	1
it	1
comely	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
uncovered?	1
	1
11:14	1
Doth	1
not	1
even	1
nature	1
itself	1
teach	1
you,	1
that,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
glory	1
to	1
her:	1
for	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
covering.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
contentious,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
custom,	1
neither	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:17	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
better,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
partly	1
believe	1
it.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
also	1
heresies	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
approved	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
11:20	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
therefore	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Lord's	1
supper.	1
	1
11:21	1
For	1
in	1
eating	1
every	1
one	1
taketh	1
before	1
other	1
his	1
own	1
supper:	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
another	1
is	1
drunken.	1
	1
11:22	1
What?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
houses	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink	1
in?	1
or	1
despise	1
ye	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shame	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
not?	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you?	1
shall	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
in	1
this?	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
betrayed	1
took	1
bread:	1
11:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body,	1
which	1
is	1
broken	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:25	1
After	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
also	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
supped,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood:	1
this	1
do	1
ye,	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
ye	1
drink	1
it,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:26	1
For	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
ye	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup,	1
ye	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
Lord's	1
death	1
till	1
he	1
come.	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
unworthily,	1
shall	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
let	1
a	1
man	1
examine	1
himself,	1
and	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
of	1
that	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
cup.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
unworthily,	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
himself,	1
not	1
discerning	1
the	1
Lord's	1
body.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
many	1
are	1
weak	1
and	1
sickly	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
many	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:31	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
judge	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
judged.	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
judged,	1
we	1
are	1
chastened	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
condemned	1
with	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:33	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
eat,	1
tarry	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hunger,	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
at	1
home;	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
together	1
unto	1
condemnation.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
I	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant.	1
	1
12:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
Gentiles,	1
carried	1
away	1
unto	1
these	1
dumb	1
idols,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
led.	1
	1
12:3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
speaking	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
calleth	1
Jesus	1
accursed:	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
12:4	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
gifts,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
differences	1
of	1
administrations,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
operations,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
profit	1
withal.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
to	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
knowledge	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:9	1
To	1
another	1
faith	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:10	1
To	1
another	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
miracles;	1
to	1
another	1
prophecy;	1
to	1
another	1
discerning	1
of	1
spirits;	1
to	1
another	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
tongues:	1
12:11	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
worketh	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
selfsame	1
Spirit,	1
dividing	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
severally	1
as	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
many	1
members,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
body,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body:	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
baptized	1
into	1
one	1
body,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
Jews	1
or	1
Gentiles,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free;	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
made	1
to	1
drink	1
into	1
one	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:14	1
For	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
member,	1
but	1
many.	1
	1
12:15	1
If	1
the	1
foot	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
ear	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
eye,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:17	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
were	1
an	1
eye,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
hearing?	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
were	1
hearing,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
smelling?	1
	1
12:18	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
God	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
member,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
many	1
members,	1
yet	1
but	1
one	1
body.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
eye	1
cannot	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
thee:	1
nor	1
again	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
feet,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:22	1
Nay,	1
much	1
more	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
feeble,	1
are	1
necessary:	1
12:23	1
And	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
we	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
honourable,	1
upon	1
these	1
we	1
bestow	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour;	1
and	1
our	1
uncomely	1
parts	1
have	1
more	1
abundant	1
comeliness.	1
	1
12:24	1
For	1
our	1
comely	1
parts	1
have	1
no	1
need:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
tempered	1
the	1
body	1
together,	1
having	1
given	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
which	1
lacked.	1
	1
12:25	1
That	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
schism	1
in	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
whether	1
one	1
member	1
suffer,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
suffer	1
with	1
it;	1
or	1
one	1
member	1
be	1
honoured,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
rejoice	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
members	1
in	1
particular.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
first	1
apostles,	1
secondarily	1
prophets,	1
thirdly	1
teachers,	1
after	1
that	1
miracles,	1
then	1
gifts	1
of	1
healings,	1
helps,	1
governments,	1
diversities	1
of	1
tongues.	1
	1
12:29	1
Are	1
all	1
apostles?	1
are	1
all	1
prophets?	1
are	1
all	1
teachers?	1
are	1
all	1
workers	1
of	1
miracles?	1
	1
12:30	1
Have	1
all	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing?	1
do	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues?	1
do	1
all	1
interpret?	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
covet	1
earnestly	1
the	1
best	1
gifts:	1
and	1
yet	1
shew	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
way.	1
	1
13:1	1
Though	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongues	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
as	1
sounding	1
brass,	1
or	1
a	1
tinkling	1
cymbal.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
understand	1
all	1
mysteries,	1
and	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
faith,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
remove	1
mountains,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
goods	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
it	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:4	1
Charity	1
suffereth	1
long,	1
and	1
is	1
kind;	1
charity	1
envieth	1
not;	1
charity	1
vaunteth	1
not	1
itself,	1
is	1
not	1
puffed	1
up,	1
13:5	1
Doth	1
not	1
behave	1
itself	1
unseemly,	1
seeketh	1
not	1
her	1
own,	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
provoked,	1
thinketh	1
no	1
evil;	1
13:6	1
Rejoiceth	1
not	1
in	1
iniquity,	1
but	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
13:7	1
Beareth	1
all	1
things,	1
believeth	1
all	1
things,	1
hopeth	1
all	1
things,	1
endureth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:8	1
Charity	1
never	1
faileth:	1
but	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
prophecies,	1
they	1
shall	1
fail;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
tongues,	1
they	1
shall	1
cease;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
in	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
prophesy	1
in	1
part.	1
	1
13:10	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
perfect	1
is	1
come,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
away.	1
	1
13:11	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
understood	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
a	1
child:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
childish	1
things.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
glass,	1
darkly;	1
but	1
then	1
face	1
to	1
face:	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
part;	1
but	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
known.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
now	1
abideth	1
faith,	1
hope,	1
charity,	1
these	1
three;	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
charity.	1
	1
14:1	1
Follow	1
after	1
charity,	1
and	1
desire	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prophesy.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
speaketh	1
not	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
understandeth	1
him;	1
howbeit	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
he	1
speaketh	1
mysteries.	1
	1
14:3	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
exhortation,	1
and	1
comfort.	1
	1
14:4	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
edifieth	1
himself;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
edifieth	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
prophesied:	1
for	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
with	1
tongues,	1
except	1
he	1
interpret,	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
may	1
receive	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:6	1
Now,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
speaking	1
with	1
tongues,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
profit	1
you,	1
except	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
either	1
by	1
revelation,	1
or	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
or	1
by	1
prophesying,	1
or	1
by	1
doctrine?	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
even	1
things	1
without	1
life	1
giving	1
sound,	1
whether	1
pipe	1
or	1
harp,	1
except	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
distinction	1
in	1
the	1
sounds,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
piped	1
or	1
harped?	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
trumpet	1
give	1
an	1
uncertain	1
sound,	1
who	1
shall	1
prepare	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
battle?	1
	1
14:9	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
utter	1
by	1
the	1
tongue	1
words	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
spoken?	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
14:10	1
There	1
are,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
so	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
without	1
signification.	1
	1
14:11	1
Therefore	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
voice,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
a	1
barbarian,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
barbarian	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
14:12	1
Even	1
so	1
ye,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
zealous	1
of	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
seek	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
excel	1
to	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:13	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
pray	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
pray	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
my	1
spirit	1
prayeth,	1
but	1
my	1
understanding	1
is	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
14:15	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
then?	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also.	1
	1
14:16	1
Else	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bless	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
occupieth	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
unlearned	1
say	1
Amen	1
at	1
thy	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
seeing	1
he	1
understandeth	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest?	1
	1
14:17	1
For	1
thou	1
verily	1
givest	1
thanks	1
well,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
edified.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues	1
more	1
than	1
ye	1
all:	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
speak	1
five	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
understanding,	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
voice	1
I	1
might	1
teach	1
others	1
also,	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue.	1
	1
14:20	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
children	1
in	1
understanding:	1
howbeit	1
in	1
malice	1
be	1
ye	1
children,	1
but	1
in	1
understanding	1
be	1
men.	1
	1
14:21	1
In	1
the	1
law	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
With	1
men	1
of	1
other	1
tongues	1
and	1
other	1
lips	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
this	1
people;	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
hear	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Wherefore	1
tongues	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
sign,	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not:	1
but	1
prophesying	1
serveth	1
not	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
believe.	1
	1
14:23	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
be	1
come	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned,	1
or	1
unbelievers,	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
mad?	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
or	1
one	1
unlearned,	1
he	1
is	1
convinced	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
all:	1
14:25	1
And	1
thus	1
are	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
made	1
manifest;	1
and	1
so	1
falling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
will	1
worship	1
God,	1
and	1
report	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
14:26	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
then,	1
brethren?	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
hath	1
a	1
psalm,	1
hath	1
a	1
doctrine,	1
hath	1
a	1
tongue,	1
hath	1
a	1
revelation,	1
hath	1
an	1
interpretation.	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:27	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
two,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
by	1
three,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
course;	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
interpreter,	1
let	1
him	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:29	1
Let	1
the	1
prophets	1
speak	1
two	1
or	1
three,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
judge.	1
	1
14:30	1
If	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
sitteth	1
by,	1
let	1
the	1
first	1
hold	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
14:31	1
For	1
ye	1
may	1
all	1
prophesy	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
learn,	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
14:33	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
confusion,	1
but	1
of	1
peace,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
14:34	1
Let	1
your	1
women	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
churches:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
speak;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
obedience	1
as	1
also	1
saith	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
learn	1
any	1
thing,	1
let	1
them	1
ask	1
their	1
husbands	1
at	1
home:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
women	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:36	1
What?	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
from	1
you?	1
or	1
came	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
only?	1
	1
14:37	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
spiritual,	1
let	1
him	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
ignorant.	1
	1
14:39	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
covet	1
to	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues.	1
	1
14:40	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
decently	1
and	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
15:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
and	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand;	1
15:2	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
saved,	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
in	1
memory	1
what	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
unless	1
ye	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
received,	1
how	1
that	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
our	1
sins	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
15:4	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures:	1
15:5	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
Cephas,	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
twelve:	1
15:6	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
above	1
five	1
hundred	1
brethren	1
at	1
once;	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
remain	1
unto	1
this	1
present,	1
but	1
some	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
	1
15:7	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
James;	1
then	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
me	1
also,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
born	1
out	1
of	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
that	1
am	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
apostle,	1
because	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
what	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
his	1
grace	1
which	1
was	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain;	1
but	1
I	1
laboured	1
more	1
abundantly	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
Therefore	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
I	1
or	1
they,	1
so	1
we	1
preach,	1
and	1
so	1
ye	1
believed.	1
	1
15:12	1
Now	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
preached	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
how	1
say	1
some	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
then	1
is	1
Christ	1
not	1
risen:	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
risen,	1
then	1
is	1
our	1
preaching	1
vain,	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
also	1
vain.	1
	1
15:15	1
Yea,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
found	1
false	1
witnesses	1
of	1
God;	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ:	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
not	1
up,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not.	1
	1
15:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not,	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
Christ	1
raised:	1
15:17	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
raised,	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
vain;	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
15:18	1
Then	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
perished.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
only	1
we	1
have	1
hope	1
in	1
Christ,	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
most	1
miserable.	1
	1
15:20	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
Christ	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slept.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
since	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
death,	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
Adam	1
all	1
die,	1
even	1
so	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
made	1
alive.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
order:	1
Christ	1
the	1
firstfruits;	1
afterward	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
15:24	1
Then	1
cometh	1
the	1
end,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
rule	1
and	1
all	1
authority	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
15:25	1
For	1
he	1
must	1
reign,	1
till	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
enemies	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
15:26	1
The	1
last	1
enemy	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
15:27	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saith	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
put	1
under	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
manifest	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
excepted,	1
which	1
did	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
subdued	1
unto	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
also	1
himself	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
15:29	1
Else	1
what	1
shall	1
they	1
do	1
which	1
are	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not	1
at	1
all?	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
then	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
why	1
stand	1
we	1
in	1
jeopardy	1
every	1
hour?	1
	1
15:31	1
I	1
protest	1
by	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
LORD,	1
I	1
die	1
daily.	1
	1
15:32	1
If	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
with	1
beasts	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
advantageth	1
it	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not?	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
15:33	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
evil	1
communications	1
corrupt	1
good	1
manners.	1
	1
15:34	1
Awake	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sin	1
not;	1
for	1
some	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
	1
15:35	1
But	1
some	1
man	1
will	1
say,	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
raised	1
up?	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
body	1
do	1
they	1
come?	1
	1
15:36	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest	1
is	1
not	1
quickened,	1
except	1
it	1
die:	1
15:37	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest,	1
thou	1
sowest	1
not	1
that	1
body	1
that	1
shall	1
be,	1
but	1
bare	1
grain,	1
it	1
may	1
chance	1
of	1
wheat,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
grain:	1
15:38	1
But	1
God	1
giveth	1
it	1
a	1
body	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
seed	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
15:39	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flesh:	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
flesh	1
of	1
men,	1
another	1
flesh	1
of	1
beasts,	1
another	1
of	1
fishes,	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
are	1
also	1
celestial	1
bodies,	1
and	1
bodies	1
terrestrial:	1
but	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
celestial	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
is	1
another.	1
	1
15:41	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
stars:	1
for	1
one	1
star	1
differeth	1
from	1
another	1
star	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
15:42	1
So	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
corruption;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
incorruption:	1
15:43	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
glory:	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
weakness;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
power:	1
15:44	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
a	1
natural	1
body;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
body,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
living	1
soul;	1
the	1
last	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
quickening	1
spirit.	1
	1
15:46	1
Howbeit	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
first	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
natural;	1
and	1
afterward	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual.	1
	1
15:47	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
earthy;	1
the	1
second	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
15:48	1
As	1
is	1
the	1
earthy,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
earthy:	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
heavenly,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:49	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
earthy,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
bear	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:50	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
neither	1
doth	1
corruption	1
inherit	1
incorruption.	1
	1
15:51	1
Behold,	1
I	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
mystery;	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
all	1
sleep,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
changed,	1
15:52	1
In	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
trump:	1
for	1
the	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
sound,	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
15:53	1
For	1
this	1
corruptible	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
immortality.	1
	1
15:54	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
corruptible	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
immortality,	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
Death	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
victory.	1
	1
15:55	1
O	1
death,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
sting?	1
O	1
grave,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
victory?	1
15:56	1
The	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
sin;	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
15:57	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
giveth	1
us	1
the	1
victory	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:58	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
be	1
ye	1
stedfast,	1
unmoveable,	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
labour	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
collection	1
for	1
the	1
saints,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
even	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
16:2	1
Upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
lay	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
store,	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
prospered	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
gatherings	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
whomsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
approve	1
by	1
your	1
letters,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
liberality	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
meet	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
also,	1
they	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:5	1
Now	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia:	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
pass	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
abide,	1
yea,	1
and	1
winter	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
bring	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
journey	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
16:7	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
tarry	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
permit.	1
	1
16:8	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tarry	1
at	1
Ephesus	1
until	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
16:9	1
For	1
a	1
great	1
door	1
and	1
effectual	1
is	1
opened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
adversaries.	1
	1
16:10	1
Now	1
if	1
Timotheus	1
come,	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
without	1
fear:	1
for	1
he	1
worketh	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
do.	1
	1
16:11	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
despise	1
him:	1
but	1
conduct	1
him	1
forth	1
in	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
16:12	1
As	1
touching	1
our	1
brother	1
Apollos,	1
I	1
greatly	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
brethren:	1
but	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
this	1
time;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
convenient	1
time.	1
	1
16:13	1
Watch	1
ye,	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
quit	1
you	1
like	1
men,	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
16:14	1
Let	1
all	1
your	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
charity.	1
	1
16:15	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
(ye	1
know	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Stephanas,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
addicted	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
saints,)	1
16:16	1
That	1
ye	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
such,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
helpeth	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
laboureth.	1
	1
16:17	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Stephanas	1
and	1
Fortunatus	1
and	1
Achaicus:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
they	1
have	1
supplied.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
refreshed	1
my	1
spirit	1
and	1
your's:	1
therefore	1
acknowledge	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such.	1
	1
16:19	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Asia	1
salute	1
you.	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
salute	1
you	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
	1
16:20	1
All	1
the	1
brethren	1
greet	1
you.	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
16:21	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
me	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
16:22	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
not	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
Anathema	1
Maranatha.	1
	1
16:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
My	1
love	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1

	1
The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Achaia:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
mercies,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
comfort;	1
1:4	1
Who	1
comforteth	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
trouble,	1
by	1
the	1
comfort	1
wherewith	1
we	1
ourselves	1
are	1
comforted	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ	1
abound	1
in	1
us,	1
so	1
our	1
consolation	1
also	1
aboundeth	1
by	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation,	1
which	1
is	1
effectual	1
in	1
the	1
enduring	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sufferings	1
which	1
we	1
also	1
suffer:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
comforted,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
consolation	1
and	1
salvation.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
our	1
hope	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
stedfast,	1
knowing,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings,	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
we	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant	1
of	1
our	1
trouble	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
Asia,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
pressed	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
above	1
strength,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
despaired	1
even	1
of	1
life:	1
1:9	1
But	1
we	1
had	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
trust	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
in	1
God	1
which	1
raiseth	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:10	1
Who	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
death,	1
and	1
doth	1
deliver:	1
in	1
whom	1
we	1
trust	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
yet	1
deliver	1
us;	1
1:11	1
Ye	1
also	1
helping	1
together	1
by	1
prayer	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
gift	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
thanks	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
many	1
on	1
our	1
behalf.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
our	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
this,	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
conscience,	1
that	1
in	1
simplicity	1
and	1
godly	1
sincerity,	1
not	1
with	1
fleshly	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
you-ward.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
we	1
write	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
than	1
what	1
ye	1
read	1
or	1
acknowledge;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
ye	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
1:14	1
As	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
acknowledged	1
us	1
in	1
part,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
your	1
rejoicing,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
our's	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
I	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
second	1
benefit;	1
1:16	1
And	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
out	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
toward	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:17	1
When	1
I	1
therefore	1
was	1
thus	1
minded,	1
did	1
I	1
use	1
lightness?	1
or	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
purpose,	1
do	1
I	1
purpose	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
with	1
me	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
yea	1
yea,	1
and	1
nay	1
nay?	1
	1
1:18	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
is	1
true,	1
our	1
word	1
toward	1
you	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
was	1
preached	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
us,	1
even	1
by	1
me	1
and	1
Silvanus	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
was	1
not	1
yea	1
and	1
nay,	1
but	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
yea.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him	1
are	1
yea,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
Amen,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
us.	1
	1
1:21	1
Now	1
he	1
which	1
stablisheth	1
us	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
anointed	1
us,	1
is	1
God;	1
1:22	1
Who	1
hath	1
also	1
sealed	1
us,	1
and	1
given	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:23	1
Moreover	1
I	1
call	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
record	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
to	1
spare	1
you	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
unto	1
Corinth.	1
	1
1:24	1
Not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
your	1
faith,	1
but	1
are	1
helpers	1
of	1
your	1
joy:	1
for	1
by	1
faith	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
I	1
determined	1
this	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
heaviness.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
you	1
sorry,	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
that	1
maketh	1
me	1
glad,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
is	1
made	1
sorry	1
by	1
me?	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
wrote	1
this	1
same	1
unto	1
you,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
from	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
rejoice;	1
having	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
is	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
much	1
affliction	1
and	1
anguish	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
many	1
tears;	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
grieved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
abundantly	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
have	1
caused	1
grief,	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
grieved	1
me,	1
but	1
in	1
part:	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
overcharge	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:6	1
Sufficient	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
this	1
punishment,	1
which	1
was	1
inflicted	1
of	1
many.	1
	1
2:7	1
So	1
that	1
contrariwise	1
ye	1
ought	1
rather	1
to	1
forgive	1
him,	1
and	1
comfort	1
him,	1
lest	1
perhaps	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
with	1
overmuch	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:8	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
confirm	1
your	1
love	1
toward	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
also	1
did	1
I	1
write,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
you,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
obedient	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:10	1
To	1
whom	1
ye	1
forgive	1
any	1
thing,	1
I	1
forgive	1
also:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
forgave	1
any	1
thing,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
forgave	1
it,	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
forgave	1
I	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:11	1
Lest	1
Satan	1
should	1
get	1
an	1
advantage	1
of	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
devices.	1
	1
2:12	1
Furthermore,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Troas	1
to	1
preach	1
Christ's	1
gospel,	1
and	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
2:13	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
rest	1
in	1
my	1
spirit,	1
because	1
I	1
found	1
not	1
Titus	1
my	1
brother:	1
but	1
taking	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
went	1
from	1
thence	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
2:14	1
Now	1
thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
always	1
causeth	1
us	1
to	1
triumph	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
maketh	1
manifest	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
his	1
knowledge	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
every	1
place.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
sweet	1
savour	1
of	1
Christ,	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
saved,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish:	1
2:16	1
To	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
death	1
unto	1
death;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
life	1
unto	1
life.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
as	1
many,	1
which	1
corrupt	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
sincerity,	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
speak	1
we	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
Do	1
we	1
begin	1
again	1
to	1
commend	1
ourselves?	1
or	1
need	1
we,	1
as	1
some	1
others,	1
epistles	1
of	1
commendation	1
to	1
you,	1
or	1
letters	1
of	1
commendation	1
from	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
epistle	1
written	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
known	1
and	1
read	1
of	1
all	1
men:	1
3:3	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
manifestly	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
epistle	1
of	1
Christ	1
ministered	1
by	1
us,	1
written	1
not	1
with	1
ink,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
not	1
in	1
tables	1
of	1
stone,	1
but	1
in	1
fleshy	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
such	1
trust	1
have	1
we	1
through	1
Christ	1
to	1
God-ward:	1
3:5	1
Not	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sufficient	1
of	1
ourselves	1
to	1
think	1
any	1
thing	1
as	1
of	1
ourselves;	1
but	1
our	1
sufficiency	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
3:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
able	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament;	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
letter	1
killeth,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
giveth	1
life.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
death,	1
written	1
and	1
engraven	1
in	1
stones,	1
was	1
glorious,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Moses	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
countenance;	1
which	1
glory	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
away:	1
3:8	1
How	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
be	1
rather	1
glorious?	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
condemnation	1
be	1
glory,	1
much	1
more	1
doth	1
the	1
ministration	1
of	1
righteousness	1
exceed	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
glorious	1
had	1
no	1
glory	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
excelleth.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
was	1
glorious,	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
which	1
remaineth	1
is	1
glorious.	1
	1
3:12	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
such	1
hope,	1
we	1
use	1
great	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech:	1
3:13	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
Moses,	1
which	1
put	1
a	1
vail	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
that	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
could	1
not	1
stedfastly	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
abolished:	1
3:14	1
But	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
blinded:	1
for	1
until	1
this	1
day	1
remaineth	1
the	1
same	1
vail	1
untaken	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
testament;	1
which	1
vail	1
is	1
done	1
away	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:15	1
But	1
even	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
when	1
Moses	1
is	1
read,	1
the	1
vail	1
is	1
upon	1
their	1
heart.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
vail	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
that	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
liberty.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
we	1
all,	1
with	1
open	1
face	1
beholding	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
are	1
changed	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
image	1
from	1
glory	1
to	1
glory,	1
even	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
ministry,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
mercy,	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
4:2	1
But	1
have	1
renounced	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
dishonesty,	1
not	1
walking	1
in	1
craftiness,	1
nor	1
handling	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
deceitfully;	1
but	1
by	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
conscience	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
gospel	1
be	1
hid,	1
it	1
is	1
hid	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
lost:	1
4:4	1
In	1
whom	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
hath	1
blinded	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
not,	1
lest	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
God,	1
should	1
shine	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
we	1
preach	1
not	1
ourselves,	1
but	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
ourselves	1
your	1
servants	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
God,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
light	1
to	1
shine	1
out	1
of	1
darkness,	1
hath	1
shined	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
treasure	1
in	1
earthen	1
vessels,	1
that	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
4:8	1
We	1
are	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
yet	1
not	1
distressed;	1
we	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
despair;	1
4:9	1
Persecuted,	1
but	1
not	1
forsaken;	1
cast	1
down,	1
but	1
not	1
destroyed;	1
4:10	1
Always	1
bearing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
the	1
dying	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
4:11	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
live	1
are	1
alway	1
delivered	1
unto	1
death	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
also	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
our	1
mortal	1
flesh.	1
	1
4:12	1
So	1
then	1
death	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
4:13	1
We	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
of	1
faith,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
believed,	1
and	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
spoken;	1
we	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
therefore	1
speak;	1
4:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
also	1
by	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shall	1
present	1
us	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
that	1
the	1
abundant	1
grace	1
might	1
through	1
the	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
many	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
we	1
faint	1
not;	1
but	1
though	1
our	1
outward	1
man	1
perish,	1
yet	1
the	1
inward	1
man	1
is	1
renewed	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
our	1
light	1
affliction,	1
which	1
is	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
worketh	1
for	1
us	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
exceeding	1
and	1
eternal	1
weight	1
of	1
glory;	1
4:18	1
While	1
we	1
look	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
are	1
temporal;	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
seen	1
are	1
eternal.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
our	1
earthly	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
were	1
dissolved,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
building	1
of	1
God,	1
an	1
house	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
eternal	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
we	1
groan,	1
earnestly	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
clothed	1
upon	1
with	1
our	1
house	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
heaven:	1
5:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
being	1
clothed	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
naked.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
we	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle	1
do	1
groan,	1
being	1
burdened:	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
unclothed,	1
but	1
clothed	1
upon,	1
that	1
mortality	1
might	1
be	1
swallowed	1
up	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
wrought	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
selfsame	1
thing	1
is	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
always	1
confident,	1
knowing	1
that,	1
whilst	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
we	1
are	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:7	1
(For	1
we	1
walk	1
by	1
faith,	1
not	1
by	1
sight:)	1
5:8	1
We	1
are	1
confident,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
willing	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
labour,	1
that,	1
whether	1
present	1
or	1
absent,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
we	1
must	1
all	1
appear	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
things	1
done	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
done,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
	1
5:11	1
Knowing	1
therefore	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
we	1
persuade	1
men;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
God;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
also	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
your	1
consciences.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
we	1
commend	1
not	1
ourselves	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
give	1
you	1
occasion	1
to	1
glory	1
on	1
our	1
behalf,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
answer	1
them	1
which	1
glory	1
in	1
appearance,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
heart.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
beside	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
God:	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
sober,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
cause.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ	1
constraineth	1
us;	1
because	1
we	1
thus	1
judge,	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
then	1
were	1
all	1
dead:	1
5:15	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
for	1
all,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
live	1
should	1
not	1
henceforth	1
live	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
died	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
rose	1
again.	1
	1
5:16	1
Wherefore	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
yea,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
Christ	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
now	1
henceforth	1
know	1
we	1
him	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
5:17	1
Therefore	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
creature:	1
old	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away;	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
become	1
new.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
reconciled	1
us	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
reconciliation;	1
5:19	1
To	1
wit,	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
in	1
Christ,	1
reconciling	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
himself,	1
not	1
imputing	1
their	1
trespasses	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
hath	1
committed	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
5:20	1
Now	1
then	1
we	1
are	1
ambassadors	1
for	1
Christ,	1
as	1
though	1
God	1
did	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
us:	1
we	1
pray	1
you	1
in	1
Christ's	1
stead,	1
be	1
ye	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sin	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
knew	1
no	1
sin;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:1	1
We	1
then,	1
as	1
workers	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
beseech	1
you	1
also	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
6:2	1
(For	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
accepted,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation	1
have	1
I	1
succoured	1
thee:	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
accepted	1
time;	1
behold,	1
now	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
salvation.)	1
	1
6:3	1
Giving	1
no	1
offence	1
in	1
any	1
thing,	1
that	1
the	1
ministry	1
be	1
not	1
blamed:	1
6:4	1
But	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
approving	1
ourselves	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
God,	1
in	1
much	1
patience,	1
in	1
afflictions,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
distresses,	1
6:5	1
In	1
stripes,	1
in	1
imprisonments,	1
in	1
tumults,	1
in	1
labours,	1
in	1
watchings,	1
in	1
fastings;	1
6:6	1
By	1
pureness,	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
by	1
longsuffering,	1
by	1
kindness,	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
by	1
love	1
unfeigned,	1
6:7	1
By	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
by	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
righteousness	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
6:8	1
By	1
honour	1
and	1
dishonour,	1
by	1
evil	1
report	1
and	1
good	1
report:	1
as	1
deceivers,	1
and	1
yet	1
true;	1
6:9	1
As	1
unknown,	1
and	1
yet	1
well	1
known;	1
as	1
dying,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
we	1
live;	1
as	1
chastened,	1
and	1
not	1
killed;	1
6:10	1
As	1
sorrowful,	1
yet	1
alway	1
rejoicing;	1
as	1
poor,	1
yet	1
making	1
many	1
rich;	1
as	1
having	1
nothing,	1
and	1
yet	1
possessing	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
6:11	1
O	1
ye	1
Corinthians,	1
our	1
mouth	1
is	1
open	1
unto	1
you,	1
our	1
heart	1
is	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:12	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
straitened	1
in	1
us,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
straitened	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
bowels.	1
	1
6:13	1
Now	1
for	1
a	1
recompence	1
in	1
the	1
same,	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
unto	1
my	1
children,)	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
enlarged.	1
	1
6:14	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
unequally	1
yoked	1
together	1
with	1
unbelievers:	1
for	1
what	1
fellowship	1
hath	1
righteousness	1
with	1
unrighteousness?	1
and	1
what	1
communion	1
hath	1
light	1
with	1
darkness?	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
what	1
concord	1
hath	1
Christ	1
with	1
Belial?	1
or	1
what	1
part	1
hath	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
with	1
an	1
infidel?	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
what	1
agreement	1
hath	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
idols?	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God;	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherefore	1
come	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
separate,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
unclean	1
thing;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
Father	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
Almighty.	1
	1
7:1	1
Having	1
therefore	1
these	1
promises,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
cleanse	1
ourselves	1
from	1
all	1
filthiness	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
spirit,	1
perfecting	1
holiness	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:2	1
Receive	1
us;	1
we	1
have	1
wronged	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
corrupted	1
no	1
man,	1
we	1
have	1
defrauded	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
7:3	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
this	1
to	1
condemn	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
die	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
7:4	1
Great	1
is	1
my	1
boldness	1
of	1
speech	1
toward	1
you,	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
glorying	1
of	1
you:	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
comfort,	1
I	1
am	1
exceeding	1
joyful	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
tribulation.	1
	1
7:5	1
For,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
our	1
flesh	1
had	1
no	1
rest,	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
troubled	1
on	1
every	1
side;	1
without	1
were	1
fightings,	1
within	1
were	1
fears.	1
	1
7:6	1
Nevertheless	1
God,	1
that	1
comforteth	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
cast	1
down,	1
comforted	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
Titus;	1
7:7	1
And	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
coming	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
consolation	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
comforted	1
in	1
you,	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
your	1
earnest	1
desire,	1
your	1
mourning,	1
your	1
fervent	1
mind	1
toward	1
me;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
made	1
you	1
sorry	1
with	1
a	1
letter,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
repent,	1
though	1
I	1
did	1
repent:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
epistle	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
sorry,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
7:9	1
Now	1
I	1
rejoice,	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
to	1
repentance:	1
for	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
sorry	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
manner,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
damage	1
by	1
us	1
in	1
nothing.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
godly	1
sorrow	1
worketh	1
repentance	1
to	1
salvation	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
repented	1
of:	1
but	1
the	1
sorrow	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
worketh	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
behold	1
this	1
selfsame	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrowed	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
what	1
carefulness	1
it	1
wrought	1
in	1
you,	1
yea,	1
what	1
clearing	1
of	1
yourselves,	1
yea,	1
what	1
indignation,	1
yea,	1
what	1
fear,	1
yea,	1
what	1
vehement	1
desire,	1
yea,	1
what	1
zeal,	1
yea,	1
what	1
revenge!	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
approved	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
clear	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
wrong,	1
nor	1
for	1
his	1
cause	1
that	1
suffered	1
wrong,	1
but	1
that	1
our	1
care	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
appear	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
in	1
your	1
comfort:	1
yea,	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
the	1
more	1
joyed	1
we	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
Titus,	1
because	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
refreshed	1
by	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
boasted	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
him	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
spake	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
truth,	1
even	1
so	1
our	1
boasting,	1
which	1
I	1
made	1
before	1
Titus,	1
is	1
found	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
his	1
inward	1
affection	1
is	1
more	1
abundant	1
toward	1
you,	1
whilst	1
he	1
remembereth	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
how	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
ye	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
rejoice	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
8:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
do	1
you	1
to	1
wit	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
bestowed	1
on	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Macedonia;	1
8:2	1
How	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
trial	1
of	1
affliction	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
their	1
joy	1
and	1
their	1
deep	1
poverty	1
abounded	1
unto	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
their	1
liberality.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
to	1
their	1
power,	1
I	1
bear	1
record,	1
yea,	1
and	1
beyond	1
their	1
power	1
they	1
were	1
willing	1
of	1
themselves;	1
8:4	1
Praying	1
us	1
with	1
much	1
intreaty	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
receive	1
the	1
gift,	1
and	1
take	1
upon	1
us	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
this	1
they	1
did,	1
not	1
as	1
we	1
hoped,	1
but	1
first	1
gave	1
their	1
own	1
selves	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:6	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
also	1
finish	1
in	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:7	1
Therefore,	1
as	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
every	1
thing,	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
utterance,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
diligence,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
love	1
to	1
us,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
abound	1
in	1
this	1
grace	1
also.	1
	1
8:8	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
by	1
commandment,	1
but	1
by	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
your	1
love.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
rich,	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
he	1
became	1
poor,	1
that	1
ye	1
through	1
his	1
poverty	1
might	1
be	1
rich.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
herein	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
advice:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
begun	1
before,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
forward	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
therefore	1
perform	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
it;	1
that	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
will,	1
so	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
first	1
a	1
willing	1
mind,	1
it	1
is	1
accepted	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
hath,	1
and	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
not.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
that	1
other	1
men	1
be	1
eased,	1
and	1
ye	1
burdened:	1
8:14	1
But	1
by	1
an	1
equality,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
your	1
abundance	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
their	1
want,	1
that	1
their	1
abundance	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
supply	1
for	1
your	1
want:	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
equality:	1
8:15	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
much	1
had	1
nothing	1
over;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
gathered	1
little	1
had	1
no	1
lack.	1
	1
8:16	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
put	1
the	1
same	1
earnest	1
care	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Titus	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
exhortation;	1
but	1
being	1
more	1
forward,	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
brother,	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
churches;	1
8:19	1
And	1
not	1
that	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
chosen	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
us	1
with	1
this	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Lord,	1
and	1
declaration	1
of	1
your	1
ready	1
mind:	1
8:20	1
Avoiding	1
this,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
blame	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
abundance	1
which	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
us:	1
8:21	1
Providing	1
for	1
honest	1
things,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
sent	1
with	1
them	1
our	1
brother,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
oftentimes	1
proved	1
diligent	1
in	1
many	1
things,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
diligent,	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:23	1
Whether	1
any	1
do	1
enquire	1
of	1
Titus,	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
fellowhelper	1
concerning	1
you:	1
or	1
our	1
brethren	1
be	1
enquired	1
of,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
the	1
churches,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:24	1
Wherefore	1
shew	1
ye	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
churches,	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
your	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
boasting	1
on	1
your	1
behalf.	1
	1
9:1	1
For	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
ministering	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
it	1
is	1
superfluous	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you:	1
9:2	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
forwardness	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
boast	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
Achaia	1
was	1
ready	1
a	1
year	1
ago;	1
and	1
your	1
zeal	1
hath	1
provoked	1
very	1
many.	1
	1
9:3	1
Yet	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
our	1
boasting	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
this	1
behalf;	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
ready:	1
9:4	1
Lest	1
haply	1
if	1
they	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
find	1
you	1
unprepared,	1
we	1
(that	1
we	1
say	1
not,	1
ye)	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
in	1
this	1
same	1
confident	1
boasting.	1
	1
9:5	1
Therefore	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
exhort	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
before	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
beforehand	1
your	1
bounty,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
had	1
notice	1
before,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
might	1
be	1
ready,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
bounty,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
of	1
covetousness.	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
He	1
which	1
soweth	1
sparingly	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
sparingly;	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
soweth	1
bountifully	1
shall	1
reap	1
also	1
bountifully.	1
	1
9:7	1
Every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
purposeth	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
give;	1
not	1
grudgingly,	1
or	1
of	1
necessity:	1
for	1
God	1
loveth	1
a	1
cheerful	1
giver.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
grace	1
abound	1
toward	1
you;	1
that	1
ye,	1
always	1
having	1
all	1
sufficiency	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work:	1
9:9	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
hath	1
dispersed	1
abroad;	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor:	1
his	1
righteousness	1
remaineth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
9:10	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
ministereth	1
seed	1
to	1
the	1
sower	1
both	1
minister	1
bread	1
for	1
your	1
food,	1
and	1
multiply	1
your	1
seed	1
sown,	1
and	1
increase	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
righteousness;)	1
9:11	1
Being	1
enriched	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
all	1
bountifulness,	1
which	1
causeth	1
through	1
us	1
thanksgiving	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
9:12	1
For	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
this	1
service	1
not	1
only	1
supplieth	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
but	1
is	1
abundant	1
also	1
by	1
many	1
thanksgivings	1
unto	1
God;	1
9:13	1
Whiles	1
by	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
ministration	1
they	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
professed	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
liberal	1
distribution	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
men;	1
9:14	1
And	1
by	1
their	1
prayer	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
exceeding	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
9:15	1
Thanks	1
be	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
unspeakable	1
gift.	1
	1
10:1	1
Now	1
I	1
Paul	1
myself	1
beseech	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
meekness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
in	1
presence	1
am	1
base	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
being	1
absent	1
am	1
bold	1
toward	1
you:	1
10:2	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
bold	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
that	1
confidence,	1
wherewith	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
bold	1
against	1
some,	1
which	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
though	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
war	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
10:4	1
(For	1
the	1
weapons	1
of	1
our	1
warfare	1
are	1
not	1
carnal,	1
but	1
mighty	1
through	1
God	1
to	1
the	1
pulling	1
down	1
of	1
strong	1
holds;)	1
10:5	1
Casting	1
down	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
every	1
high	1
thing	1
that	1
exalteth	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
bringing	1
into	1
captivity	1
every	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
Christ;	1
10:6	1
And	1
having	1
in	1
a	1
readiness	1
to	1
revenge	1
all	1
disobedience,	1
when	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:7	1
Do	1
ye	1
look	1
on	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
outward	1
appearance?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
trust	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
let	1
him	1
of	1
himself	1
think	1
this	1
again,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
Christ's,	1
even	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
Christ's.	1
	1
10:8	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
boast	1
somewhat	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
authority,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
for	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
destruction,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed:	1
10:9	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
terrify	1
you	1
by	1
letters.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
his	1
letters,	1
say	1
they,	1
are	1
weighty	1
and	1
powerful;	1
but	1
his	1
bodily	1
presence	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
his	1
speech	1
contemptible.	1
	1
10:11	1
Let	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
think	1
this,	1
that,	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
word	1
by	1
letters	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
absent,	1
such	1
will	1
we	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
deed	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
present.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
we	1
dare	1
not	1
make	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
or	1
compare	1
ourselves	1
with	1
some	1
that	1
commend	1
themselves:	1
but	1
they	1
measuring	1
themselves	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
comparing	1
themselves	1
among	1
themselves,	1
are	1
not	1
wise.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
boast	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
us,	1
a	1
measure	1
to	1
reach	1
even	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
we	1
stretch	1
not	1
ourselves	1
beyond	1
our	1
measure,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
reached	1
not	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
come	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
you	1
also	1
in	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
10:15	1
Not	1
boasting	1
of	1
things	1
without	1
our	1
measure,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
labours;	1
but	1
having	1
hope,	1
when	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
increased,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
enlarged	1
by	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
rule	1
abundantly,	1
10:16	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
beyond	1
you,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
boast	1
in	1
another	1
man's	1
line	1
of	1
things	1
made	1
ready	1
to	1
our	1
hand.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
10:18	1
For	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
commendeth	1
himself	1
is	1
approved,	1
but	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
commendeth.	1
	1
11:1	1
Would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
could	1
bear	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
my	1
folly:	1
and	1
indeed	1
bear	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
over	1
you	1
with	1
godly	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
espoused	1
you	1
to	1
one	1
husband,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
present	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
chaste	1
virgin	1
to	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
as	1
the	1
serpent	1
beguiled	1
Eve	1
through	1
his	1
subtilty,	1
so	1
your	1
minds	1
should	1
be	1
corrupted	1
from	1
the	1
simplicity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
preacheth	1
another	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
preached,	1
or	1
if	1
ye	1
receive	1
another	1
spirit,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received,	1
or	1
another	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
accepted,	1
ye	1
might	1
well	1
bear	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
For	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
rude	1
in	1
speech,	1
yet	1
not	1
in	1
knowledge;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
throughly	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
11:7	1
Have	1
I	1
committed	1
an	1
offence	1
in	1
abasing	1
myself	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
exalted,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
freely?	1
11:8	1
I	1
robbed	1
other	1
churches,	1
taking	1
wages	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
service.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
present	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
wanted,	1
I	1
was	1
chargeable	1
to	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lacking	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Macedonia	1
supplied:	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
myself	1
from	1
being	1
burdensome	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
keep	1
myself.	1
	1
11:10	1
As	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
stop	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
boasting	1
in	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Achaia.	1
	1
11:11	1
Wherefore?	1
because	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
not?	1
God	1
knoweth.	1
	1
11:12	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cut	1
off	1
occasion	1
from	1
them	1
which	1
desire	1
occasion;	1
that	1
wherein	1
they	1
glory,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
we.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
such	1
are	1
false	1
apostles,	1
deceitful	1
workers,	1
transforming	1
themselves	1
into	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
no	1
marvel;	1
for	1
Satan	1
himself	1
is	1
transformed	1
into	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
11:15	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
his	1
ministers	1
also	1
be	1
transformed	1
as	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
whose	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
11:16	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
think	1
me	1
a	1
fool;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
yet	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
receive	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
boast	1
myself	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
11:17	1
That	1
which	1
I	1
speak,	1
I	1
speak	1
it	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
foolishly,	1
in	1
this	1
confidence	1
of	1
boasting.	1
	1
11:18	1
Seeing	1
that	1
many	1
glory	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
also.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer	1
fools	1
gladly,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
wise.	1
	1
11:20	1
For	1
ye	1
suffer,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
bondage,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
devour	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
take	1
of	1
you,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
smite	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
11:21	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
concerning	1
reproach,	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
weak.	1
Howbeit	1
whereinsoever	1
any	1
is	1
bold,	1
(I	1
speak	1
foolishly,)	1
I	1
am	1
bold	1
also.	1
	1
11:22	1
Are	1
they	1
Hebrews?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
Israelites?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
Are	1
they	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham?	1
so	1
am	1
I.	1
	1
11:23	1
Are	1
they	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
fool)	1
I	1
am	1
more;	1
in	1
labours	1
more	1
abundant,	1
in	1
stripes	1
above	1
measure,	1
in	1
prisons	1
more	1
frequent,	1
in	1
deaths	1
oft.	1
	1
11:24	1
Of	1
the	1
Jews	1
five	1
times	1
received	1
I	1
forty	1
stripes	1
save	1
one.	1
	1
11:25	1
Thrice	1
was	1
I	1
beaten	1
with	1
rods,	1
once	1
was	1
I	1
stoned,	1
thrice	1
I	1
suffered	1
shipwreck,	1
a	1
night	1
and	1
a	1
day	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
deep;	1
11:26	1
In	1
journeyings	1
often,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
waters,	1
in	1
perils	1
of	1
robbers,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
mine	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
in	1
perils	1
by	1
the	1
heathen,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
perils	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
in	1
perils	1
among	1
false	1
brethren;	1
11:27	1
In	1
weariness	1
and	1
painfulness,	1
in	1
watchings	1
often,	1
in	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst,	1
in	1
fastings	1
often,	1
in	1
cold	1
and	1
nakedness.	1
	1
11:28	1
Beside	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
upon	1
me	1
daily,	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
11:29	1
Who	1
is	1
weak,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
weak?	1
who	1
is	1
offended,	1
and	1
I	1
burn	1
not?	1
11:30	1
If	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
glory,	1
I	1
will	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
evermore,	1
knoweth	1
that	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
11:32	1
In	1
Damascus	1
the	1
governor	1
under	1
Aretas	1
the	1
king	1
kept	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Damascenes	1
with	1
a	1
garrison,	1
desirous	1
to	1
apprehend	1
me:	1
11:33	1
And	1
through	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
a	1
basket	1
was	1
I	1
let	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
escaped	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:1	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
expedient	1
for	1
me	1
doubtless	1
to	1
glory.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
visions	1
and	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:2	1
I	1
knew	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Christ	1
above	1
fourteen	1
years	1
ago,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell;	1
or	1
whether	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
caught	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
(whether	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell:	1
God	1
knoweth;)	1
12:4	1
How	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
into	1
paradise,	1
and	1
heard	1
unspeakable	1
words,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
utter.	1
	1
12:5	1
Of	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
will	1
I	1
glory:	1
yet	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
glory,	1
but	1
in	1
mine	1
infirmities.	1
	1
12:6	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
desire	1
to	1
glory,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
fool;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
the	1
truth:	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
forbear,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
think	1
of	1
me	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeth	1
me	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
heareth	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
revelations,	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
thorn	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
Satan	1
to	1
buffet	1
me,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
measure.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
this	1
thing	1
I	1
besought	1
the	1
Lord	1
thrice,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
depart	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
grace	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
thee:	1
for	1
my	1
strength	1
is	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
weakness.	1
Most	1
gladly	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
rather	1
glory	1
in	1
my	1
infirmities,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Christ	1
may	1
rest	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
12:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
infirmities,	1
in	1
reproaches,	1
in	1
necessities,	1
in	1
persecutions,	1
in	1
distresses	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake:	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
weak,	1
then	1
am	1
I	1
strong.	1
	1
12:11	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
glorying;	1
ye	1
have	1
compelled	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
commended	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
in	1
nothing	1
am	1
I	1
behind	1
the	1
very	1
chiefest	1
apostles,	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
nothing.	1
	1
12:12	1
Truly	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
an	1
apostle	1
were	1
wrought	1
among	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
patience,	1
in	1
signs,	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
mighty	1
deeds.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
inferior	1
to	1
other	1
churches,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
not	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you?	1
forgive	1
me	1
this	1
wrong.	1
	1
12:14	1
Behold,	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
burdensome	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
your's	1
but	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
parents,	1
but	1
the	1
parents	1
for	1
the	1
children.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
very	1
gladly	1
spend	1
and	1
be	1
spent	1
for	1
you;	1
though	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
the	1
less	1
I	1
be	1
loved.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
be	1
it	1
so,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
burden	1
you:	1
nevertheless,	1
being	1
crafty,	1
I	1
caught	1
you	1
with	1
guile.	1
	1
12:17	1
Did	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
whom	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you?	1
12:18	1
I	1
desired	1
Titus,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
I	1
sent	1
a	1
brother.	1
Did	1
Titus	1
make	1
a	1
gain	1
of	1
you?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
spirit?	1
walked	1
we	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
steps?	1
	1
12:19	1
Again,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
we	1
excuse	1
ourselves	1
unto	1
you?	1
we	1
speak	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
Christ:	1
but	1
we	1
do	1
all	1
things,	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
for	1
your	1
edifying.	1
	1
12:20	1
For	1
I	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
you	1
such	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
not:	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
debates,	1
envyings,	1
wraths,	1
strifes,	1
backbitings,	1
whisperings,	1
swellings,	1
tumults:	1
12:21	1
And	1
lest,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
humble	1
me	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
bewail	1
many	1
which	1
have	1
sinned	1
already,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
fornication	1
and	1
lasciviousness	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
committed.	1
	1
13:1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
In	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
shall	1
every	1
word	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
13:2	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
before,	1
and	1
foretell	1
you,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
the	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
being	1
absent	1
now	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
heretofore	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
other,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
spare:	1
13:3	1
Since	1
ye	1
seek	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
Christ	1
speaking	1
in	1
me,	1
which	1
to	1
you-ward	1
is	1
not	1
weak,	1
but	1
is	1
mighty	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
13:4	1
For	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
through	1
weakness,	1
yet	1
he	1
liveth	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
For	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
weak	1
in	1
him,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
you.	1
	1
13:5	1
Examine	1
yourselves,	1
whether	1
ye	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
prove	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
your	1
own	1
selves,	1
how	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
except	1
ye	1
be	1
reprobates?	1
	1
13:6	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:7	1
Now	1
I	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
no	1
evil;	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
appear	1
approved,	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
honest,	1
though	1
we	1
be	1
as	1
reprobates.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
glad,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
strong:	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
we	1
wish,	1
even	1
your	1
perfection.	1
	1
13:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
write	1
these	1
things	1
being	1
absent,	1
lest	1
being	1
present	1
I	1
should	1
use	1
sharpness,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
destruction.	1
	1
13:11	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
farewell.	1
Be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
be	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
live	1
in	1
peace;	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
13:12	1
Greet	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
13:13	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:14	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Galatians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(not	1
of	1
men,	1
neither	1
by	1
man,	1
but	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead;)	1
1:2	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:4	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
evil	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father:	1
1:5	1
To	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:6	1
I	1
marvel	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
so	1
soon	1
removed	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
called	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
Christ	1
unto	1
another	1
gospel:	1
1:7	1
Which	1
is	1
not	1
another;	1
but	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
that	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
pervert	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
though	1
we,	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
from	1
heaven,	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:9	1
As	1
we	1
said	1
before,	1
so	1
say	1
I	1
now	1
again,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
preach	1
any	1
other	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
accursed.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
do	1
I	1
now	1
persuade	1
men,	1
or	1
God?	1
or	1
do	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
please	1
men?	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
pleased	1
men,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
But	1
I	1
certify	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
after	1
man.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
I	1
neither	1
received	1
it	1
of	1
man,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
taught	1
it,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
conversation	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion,	1
how	1
that	1
beyond	1
measure	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
wasted	1
it:	1
1:14	1
And	1
profited	1
in	1
the	1
Jews'	1
religion	1
above	1
many	1
my	1
equals	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
nation,	1
being	1
more	1
exceedingly	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
traditions	1
of	1
my	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:15	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
pleased	1
God,	1
who	1
separated	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
called	1
me	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
1:16	1
To	1
reveal	1
his	1
Son	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
preach	1
him	1
among	1
the	1
heathen;	1
immediately	1
I	1
conferred	1
not	1
with	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood:	1
1:17	1
Neither	1
went	1
I	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
apostles	1
before	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
returned	1
again	1
unto	1
Damascus.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
after	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
see	1
Peter,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
fifteen	1
days.	1
	1
1:19	1
But	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
saw	1
I	1
none,	1
save	1
James	1
the	1
Lord's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:20	1
Now	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
behold,	1
before	1
God,	1
I	1
lie	1
not.	1
	1
1:21	1
Afterwards	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia;	1
1:22	1
And	1
was	1
unknown	1
by	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Judaea	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:23	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
only,	1
That	1
he	1
which	1
persecuted	1
us	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
now	1
preacheth	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
once	1
he	1
destroyed.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
glorified	1
God	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
took	1
Titus	1
with	1
me	1
also.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
by	1
revelation,	1
and	1
communicated	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
but	1
privately	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
reputation,	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
should	1
run,	1
or	1
had	1
run,	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:3	1
But	1
neither	1
Titus,	1
who	1
was	1
with	1
me,	1
being	1
a	1
Greek,	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised:	1
2:4	1
And	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
false	1
brethren	1
unawares	1
brought	1
in,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
privily	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
our	1
liberty	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
into	1
bondage:	1
2:5	1
To	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
place	1
by	1
subjection,	1
no,	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
might	1
continue	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
of	1
these	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat,	1
(whatsoever	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
maketh	1
no	1
matter	1
to	1
me:	1
God	1
accepteth	1
no	1
man's	1
person:)	1
for	1
they	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
somewhat	1
in	1
conference	1
added	1
nothing	1
to	1
me:	1
2:7	1
But	1
contrariwise,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
was	1
unto	1
Peter;	1
2:8	1
(For	1
he	1
that	1
wrought	1
effectually	1
in	1
Peter	1
to	1
the	1
apostleship	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
me	1
toward	1
the	1
Gentiles:)	1
2:9	1
And	1
when	1
James,	1
Cephas,	1
and	1
John,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pillars,	1
perceived	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
they	1
gave	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
the	1
right	1
hands	1
of	1
fellowship;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
they	1
unto	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:10	1
Only	1
they	1
would	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
remember	1
the	1
poor;	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
forward	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
I	1
withstood	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
face,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
blamed.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
before	1
that	1
certain	1
came	1
from	1
James,	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
and	1
separated	1
himself,	1
fearing	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
Jews	1
dissembled	1
likewise	1
with	1
him;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Barnabas	1
also	1
was	1
carried	1
away	1
with	1
their	1
dissimulation.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
walked	1
not	1
uprightly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
livest	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews,	1
why	1
compellest	1
thou	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
do	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
2:15	1
We	1
who	1
are	1
Jews	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
not	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
2:16	1
Knowing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
even	1
we	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
if,	1
while	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
Christ,	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
are	1
found	1
sinners,	1
is	1
therefore	1
Christ	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
destroyed,	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
a	1
transgressor.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
I	1
through	1
the	1
law	1
am	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
live	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
am	1
crucified	1
with	1
Christ:	1
neverthless	1
I	1
live;	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
Christ	1
liveth	1
in	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
now	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
me.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
frustrate	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
if	1
righteousness	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
then	1
Christ	1
is	1
dead	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:1	1
O	1
foolish	1
Galatians,	1
who	1
hath	1
bewitched	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
before	1
whose	1
eyes	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
been	1
evidently	1
set	1
forth,	1
crucified	1
among	1
you?	1
	1
3:2	1
This	1
only	1
would	1
I	1
learn	1
of	1
you,	1
Received	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:3	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
foolish?	1
having	1
begun	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
are	1
ye	1
now	1
made	1
perfect	1
by	1
the	1
flesh?	1
	1
3:4	1
Have	1
ye	1
suffered	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
in	1
vain?	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
yet	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
ministereth	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
worketh	1
miracles	1
among	1
you,	1
doeth	1
he	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
faith?	1
	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
accounted	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:7	1
Know	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
faith,	1
the	1
same	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
the	1
scripture,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
justify	1
the	1
heathen	1
through	1
faith,	1
preached	1
before	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
saying,	1
In	1
thee	1
shall	1
all	1
nations	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:9	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
which	1
be	1
of	1
faith	1
are	1
blessed	1
with	1
faithful	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
curse:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
continueth	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
3:11	1
But	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
it	1
is	1
evident:	1
for,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
but,	1
The	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
them	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:13	1
Christ	1
hath	1
redeemed	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
curse	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
being	1
made	1
a	1
curse	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Cursed	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hangeth	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
3:14	1
That	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
Abraham	1
might	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:15	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men;	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
man's	1
covenant,	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
confirmed,	1
no	1
man	1
disannulleth,	1
or	1
addeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
to	1
Abraham	1
and	1
his	1
seed	1
were	1
the	1
promises	1
made.	1
He	1
saith	1
not,	1
And	1
to	1
seeds,	1
as	1
of	1
many;	1
but	1
as	1
of	1
one,	1
And	1
to	1
thy	1
seed,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
covenant,	1
that	1
was	1
confirmed	1
before	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ,	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
was	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
years	1
after,	1
cannot	1
disannul,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
make	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
inheritance	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
promise:	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Abraham	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
3:19	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
serveth	1
the	1
law?	1
It	1
was	1
added	1
because	1
of	1
transgressions,	1
till	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
promise	1
was	1
made;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
ordained	1
by	1
angels	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
mediator.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
a	1
mediator	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mediator	1
of	1
one,	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
one.	1
	1
3:21	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
then	1
against	1
the	1
promises	1
of	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
law	1
given	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
life,	1
verily	1
righteousness	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:22	1
But	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
concluded	1
all	1
under	1
sin,	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
3:23	1
But	1
before	1
faith	1
came,	1
we	1
were	1
kept	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
shut	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
should	1
afterwards	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
3:24	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
our	1
schoolmaster	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
3:25	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
faith	1
is	1
come,	1
we	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
under	1
a	1
schoolmaster.	1
	1
3:26	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
have	1
been	1
baptized	1
into	1
Christ	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:28	1
There	1
is	1
neither	1
Jew	1
nor	1
Greek,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
bond	1
nor	1
free,	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
male	1
nor	1
female:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:29	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
Christ's,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
I	1
say,	1
That	1
the	1
heir,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
child,	1
differeth	1
nothing	1
from	1
a	1
servant,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
lord	1
of	1
all;	1
4:2	1
But	1
is	1
under	1
tutors	1
and	1
governors	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
of	1
the	1
father.	1
	1
4:3	1
Even	1
so	1
we,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
children,	1
were	1
in	1
bondage	1
under	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
4:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come,	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
Son,	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
woman,	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
4:5	1
To	1
redeem	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
sons.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
sons,	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
forth	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
your	1
hearts,	1
crying,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
4:7	1
Wherefore	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
more	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
a	1
son;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
son,	1
then	1
an	1
heir	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Howbeit	1
then,	1
when	1
ye	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
ye	1
did	1
service	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
by	1
nature	1
are	1
no	1
gods.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
now,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
God,	1
or	1
rather	1
are	1
known	1
of	1
God,	1
how	1
turn	1
ye	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
beggarly	1
elements,	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
desire	1
again	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
bondage?	1
	1
4:10	1
Ye	1
observe	1
days,	1
and	1
months,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
years.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,	1
lest	1
I	1
have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
you	1
labour	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
4:12	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
am;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
ye	1
are:	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
injured	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
4:13	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
through	1
infirmity	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
I	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
my	1
temptation	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
ye	1
despised	1
not,	1
nor	1
rejected;	1
but	1
received	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:15	1
Where	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
blessedness	1
ye	1
spake	1
of?	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
record,	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
possible,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
plucked	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
4:16	1
Am	1
I	1
therefore	1
become	1
your	1
enemy,	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth?	1
4:17	1
They	1
zealously	1
affect	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
well;	1
yea,	1
they	1
would	1
exclude	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
affect	1
them.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
zealously	1
affected	1
always	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
travail	1
in	1
birth	1
again	1
until	1
Christ	1
be	1
formed	1
in	1
you,	1
4:20	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
with	1
you	1
now,	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
voice;	1
for	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
doubt	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
4:21	1
Tell	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
Abraham	1
had	1
two	1
sons,	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
a	1
bondmaid,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman	1
was	1
by	1
promise.	1
	1
4:24	1
Which	1
things	1
are	1
an	1
allegory:	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
covenants;	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
Sinai,	1
which	1
gendereth	1
to	1
bondage,	1
which	1
is	1
Agar.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
this	1
Agar	1
is	1
mount	1
Sinai	1
in	1
Arabia,	1
and	1
answereth	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
bondage	1
with	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
4:26	1
But	1
Jerusalem	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
is	1
free,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
us	1
all.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Rejoice,	1
thou	1
barren	1
that	1
bearest	1
not;	1
break	1
forth	1
and	1
cry,	1
thou	1
that	1
travailest	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
desolate	1
hath	1
many	1
more	1
children	1
than	1
she	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband.	1
	1
4:28	1
Now	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
Isaac	1
was,	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
promise.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
as	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
persecuted	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
	1
4:30	1
Nevertheless	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Cast	1
out	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
and	1
her	1
son:	1
for	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
heir	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
freewoman.	1
	1
4:31	1
So	1
then,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bondwoman,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
free.	1
	1
5:1	1
Stand	1
fast	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
liberty	1
wherewith	1
Christ	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
free,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
entangled	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
yoke	1
of	1
bondage.	1
	1
5:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
Paul	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
Christ	1
shall	1
profit	1
you	1
nothing.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
again	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
whole	1
law.	1
	1
5:4	1
Christ	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
no	1
effect	1
unto	1
you,	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
are	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
are	1
fallen	1
from	1
grace.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
we	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
righteousness	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision;	1
but	1
faith	1
which	1
worketh	1
by	1
love.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
did	1
run	1
well;	1
who	1
did	1
hinder	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth?	1
	1
5:8	1
This	1
persuasion	1
cometh	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth	1
you.	1
	1
5:9	1
A	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump.	1
	1
5:10	1
I	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
will	1
be	1
none	1
otherwise	1
minded:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
troubleth	1
you	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
judgment,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
yet	1
preach	1
circumcision,	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
yet	1
suffer	1
persecution?	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
ceased.	1
	1
5:12	1
I	1
would	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
cut	1
off	1
which	1
trouble	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
For,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
unto	1
liberty;	1
only	1
use	1
not	1
liberty	1
for	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
by	1
love	1
serve	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
one	1
word,	1
even	1
in	1
this;	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
bite	1
and	1
devour	1
one	1
another,	1
take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
consumed	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
5:16	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
the	1
flesh	1
lusteth	1
against	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
against	1
the	1
flesh:	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
contrary	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
so	1
that	1
ye	1
cannot	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
would.	1
	1
5:18	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
led	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
5:19	1
Now	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
are	1
manifest,	1
which	1
are	1
these;	1
Adultery,	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
lasciviousness,	1
5:20	1
Idolatry,	1
witchcraft,	1
hatred,	1
variance,	1
emulations,	1
wrath,	1
strife,	1
seditions,	1
heresies,	1
5:21	1
Envyings,	1
murders,	1
drunkenness,	1
revellings,	1
and	1
such	1
like:	1
of	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
time	1
past,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
love,	1
joy,	1
peace,	1
longsuffering,	1
gentleness,	1
goodness,	1
faith,	1
5:23	1
Meekness,	1
temperance:	1
against	1
such	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
flesh	1
with	1
the	1
affections	1
and	1
lusts.	1
	1
5:25	1
If	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
let	1
us	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:26	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
vain	1
glory,	1
provoking	1
one	1
another,	1
envying	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
6:1	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
overtaken	1
in	1
a	1
fault,	1
ye	1
which	1
are	1
spiritual,	1
restore	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness;	1
considering	1
thyself,	1
lest	1
thou	1
also	1
be	1
tempted.	1
	1
6:2	1
Bear	1
ye	1
one	1
another's	1
burdens,	1
and	1
so	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:3	1
For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
something,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
nothing,	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
himself.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
prove	1
his	1
own	1
work,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
have	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
himself	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
bear	1
his	1
own	1
burden.	1
	1
6:6	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
communicate	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
teacheth	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
things.	1
	1
6:7	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived;	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
mocked:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
a	1
man	1
soweth,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
also	1
reap.	1
	1
6:8	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
his	1
flesh	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
reap	1
corruption;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
to	1
the	1
Spirit	1
shall	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
reap	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
be	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing:	1
for	1
in	1
due	1
season	1
we	1
shall	1
reap,	1
if	1
we	1
faint	1
not.	1
	1
6:10	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
opportunity,	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
good	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
especially	1
unto	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
6:11	1
Ye	1
see	1
how	1
large	1
a	1
letter	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand.	1
	1
6:12	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
shew	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
they	1
constrain	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
circumcised;	1
only	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
suffer	1
persecution	1
for	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
neither	1
they	1
themselves	1
who	1
are	1
circumcised	1
keep	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
circumcised,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
glory	1
in	1
your	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:14	1
But	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
glory,	1
save	1
in	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
crucified	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
For	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
neither	1
circumcision	1
availeth	1
any	1
thing,	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
creature.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
walk	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
rule,	1
peace	1
be	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
mercy,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
Israel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:17	1
From	1
henceforth	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
trouble	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
bear	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:18	1
Brethren,	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
	1
Amen.	1

1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1

by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
the	1

in	1

Grace	1

peace,	1
from	1

our	1
Father,	1

	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
blessed	1
us	1
with	1
all	1
spiritual	1
blessings	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ:	1
1:4	1
According	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen	1
us	1
in	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blame	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
love:	1
1:5	1
Having	1
predestinated	1
us	1
unto	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
children	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
1:6	1
To	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
accepted	1
in	1
the	1
beloved.	1
	1
1:7	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace;	1
1:8	1
Wherein	1
he	1
hath	1
abounded	1
toward	1
us	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prudence;	1
1:9	1
Having	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purposed	1
in	1
himself:	1
1:10	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
times	1
he	1
might	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
Christ,	1
both	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
on	1
earth;	1
even	1
in	1
him:	1
1:11	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
obtained	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
being	1
predestinated	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
worketh	1
all	1
things	1
after	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will:	1
1:12	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
who	1
first	1
trusted	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
trusted,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
your	1
salvation:	1
in	1
whom	1
also	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
believed,	1
ye	1
were	1
sealed	1
with	1
that	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
promise,	1
1:14	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
earnest	1
of	1
our	1
inheritance	1
until	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
purchased	1
possession,	1
unto	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
1:15	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
also,	1
after	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
love	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:16	1
Cease	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
for	1
you,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:17	1
That	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
glory,	1
may	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
revelation	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him:	1
1:18	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
your	1
understanding	1
being	1
enlightened;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
calling,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:19	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
exceeding	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
us-ward	1
who	1
believe,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
power,	1
1:20	1
Which	1
he	1
wrought	1
in	1
Christ,	1
when	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
heavenly	1
places,	1
1:21	1
Far	1
above	1
all	1
principality,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
every	1
name	1
that	1
is	1
named,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come:	1
1:22	1
And	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
over	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
the	1
church,	1
1:23	1
Which	1
is	1
his	1
body,	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
filleth	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
you	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened,	1
who	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
trespasses	1
and	1
sins;	1
2:2	1
Wherein	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
ye	1
walked	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
now	1
worketh	1
in	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
2:3	1
Among	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
all	1
had	1
our	1
conversation	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
our	1
flesh,	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
mind;	1
and	1
were	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
wrath,	1
even	1
as	1
others.	1
	1
2:4	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
rich	1
in	1
mercy,	1
for	1
his	1
great	1
love	1
wherewith	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
2:5	1
Even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
dead	1
in	1
sins,	1
hath	1
quickened	1
us	1
together	1
with	1
Christ,	1
(by	1
grace	1
ye	1
are	1
saved;)	1
2:6	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
us	1
up	1
together,	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
sit	1
together	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:7	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
ages	1
to	1
come	1
he	1
might	1
shew	1
the	1
exceeding	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
grace	1
in	1
his	1
kindness	1
toward	1
us	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
by	1
grace	1
are	1
ye	1
saved	1
through	1
faith;	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
of	1
yourselves:	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God:	1
2:9	1
Not	1
of	1
works,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
boast.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
workmanship,	1
created	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
before	1
ordained	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
2:11	1
Wherefore	1
remember,	1
that	1
ye	1
being	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
who	1
are	1
called	1
Uncircumcision	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Circumcision	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
made	1
by	1
hands;	1
2:12	1
That	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
ye	1
were	1
without	1
Christ,	1
being	1
aliens	1
from	1
the	1
commonwealth	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
strangers	1
from	1
the	1
covenants	1
of	1
promise,	1
having	1
no	1
hope,	1
and	1
without	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
2:13	1
But	1
now	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
ye	1
who	1
sometimes	1
were	1
far	1
off	1
are	1
made	1
nigh	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
our	1
peace,	1
who	1
hath	1
made	1
both	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
broken	1
down	1
the	1
middle	1
wall	1
of	1
partition	1
between	1
us;	1
2:15	1
Having	1
abolished	1
in	1
his	1
flesh	1
the	1
enmity,	1
even	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
commandments	1
contained	1
in	1
ordinances;	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
himself	1
of	1
twain	1
one	1
new	1
man,	1
so	1
making	1
peace;	1
2:16	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reconcile	1
both	1
unto	1
God	1
in	1
one	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
cross,	1
having	1
slain	1
the	1
enmity	1
thereby:	1
2:17	1
And	1
came	1
and	1
preached	1
peace	1
to	1
you	1
which	1
were	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
nigh.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
through	1
him	1
we	1
both	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:19	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
strangers	1
and	1
foreigners,	1
but	1
fellowcitizens	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
God;	1
2:20	1
And	1
are	1
built	1
upon	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself	1
being	1
the	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone;	1
2:21	1
In	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
building	1
fitly	1
framed	1
together	1
groweth	1
unto	1
an	1
holy	1
temple	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
2:22	1
In	1
whom	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
builded	1
together	1
for	1
an	1
habitation	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:1	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
Paul,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
3:2	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
you-ward:	1
3:3	1
How	1
that	1
by	1
revelation	1
he	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
mystery;	1
(as	1
I	1
wrote	1
afore	1
in	1
few	1
words,	1
3:4	1
Whereby,	1
when	1
ye	1
read,	1
ye	1
may	1
understand	1
my	1
knowledge	1
in	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ)	1
3:5	1
Which	1
in	1
other	1
ages	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
revealed	1
unto	1
his	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
3:6	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
should	1
be	1
fellowheirs,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
body,	1
and	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
in	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
gospel:	1
3:7	1
Whereof	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:8	1
Unto	1
me,	1
who	1
am	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
saints,	1
is	1
this	1
grace	1
given,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
preach	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
the	1
unsearchable	1
riches	1
of	1
Christ;	1
3:9	1
And	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
men	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
in	1
God,	1
who	1
created	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:10	1
To	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
now	1
unto	1
the	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers	1
in	1
heavenly	1
places	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
manifold	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
3:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
purpose	1
which	1
he	1
purposed	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord:	1
3:12	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
boldness	1
and	1
access	1
with	1
confidence	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:13	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
faint	1
not	1
at	1
my	1
tribulations	1
for	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
glory.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
bow	1
my	1
knees	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
3:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
named,	1
3:16	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
you,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
to	1
be	1
strengthened	1
with	1
might	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
man;	1
3:17	1
That	1
Christ	1
may	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith;	1
that	1
ye,	1
being	1
rooted	1
and	1
grounded	1
in	1
love,	1
3:18	1
May	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
comprehend	1
with	1
all	1
saints	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth,	1
and	1
length,	1
and	1
depth,	1
and	1
height;	1
3:19	1
And	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ,	1
which	1
passeth	1
knowledge,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
exceeding	1
abundantly	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
ask	1
or	1
think,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
that	1
worketh	1
in	1
us,	1
3:21	1
Unto	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
throughout	1
all	1
ages,	1
world	1
without	1
end.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
therefore,	1
the	1
prisoner	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
beseech	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
vocation	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
are	1
called,	1
4:2	1
With	1
all	1
lowliness	1
and	1
meekness,	1
with	1
longsuffering,	1
forbearing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
love;	1
4:3	1
Endeavouring	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
4:4	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
one	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
hope	1
of	1
your	1
calling;	1
4:5	1
One	1
Lord,	1
one	1
faith,	1
one	1
baptism,	1
4:6	1
One	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
all,	1
who	1
is	1
above	1
all,	1
and	1
through	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
given	1
grace	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:8	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
When	1
he	1
ascended	1
up	1
on	1
high,	1
he	1
led	1
captivity	1
captive,	1
and	1
gave	1
gifts	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
4:9	1
(Now	1
that	1
he	1
ascended,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
also	1
descended	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
lower	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
4:10	1
He	1
that	1
descended	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
also	1
that	1
ascended	1
up	1
far	1
above	1
all	1
heavens,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
fill	1
all	1
things.)	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
some,	1
apostles;	1
and	1
some,	1
prophets;	1
and	1
some,	1
evangelists;	1
and	1
some,	1
pastors	1
and	1
teachers;	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
perfecting	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
ministry,	1
for	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:13	1
Till	1
we	1
all	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
unto	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
stature	1
of	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
Christ:	1
4:14	1
That	1
we	1
henceforth	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
children,	1
tossed	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
wind	1
of	1
doctrine,	1
by	1
the	1
sleight	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
cunning	1
craftiness,	1
whereby	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
to	1
deceive;	1
4:15	1
But	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
love,	1
may	1
grow	1
up	1
into	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head,	1
even	1
Christ:	1
4:16	1
From	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
fitly	1
joined	1
together	1
and	1
compacted	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
every	1
joint	1
supplieth,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
effectual	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
every	1
part,	1
maketh	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
unto	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
itself	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
I	1
say	1
therefore,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
ye	1
henceforth	1
walk	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
Gentiles	1
walk,	1
in	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
their	1
mind,	1
4:18	1
Having	1
the	1
understanding	1
darkened,	1
being	1
alienated	1
from	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
the	1
ignorance	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
their	1
heart:	1
4:19	1
Who	1
being	1
past	1
feeling	1
have	1
given	1
themselves	1
over	1
unto	1
lasciviousness,	1
to	1
work	1
all	1
uncleanness	1
with	1
greediness.	1
	1
4:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
learned	1
Christ;	1
4:21	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
by	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
in	1
Jesus:	1
4:22	1
That	1
ye	1
put	1
off	1
concerning	1
the	1
former	1
conversation	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
corrupt	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
deceitful	1
lusts;	1
4:23	1
And	1
be	1
renewed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
your	1
mind;	1
4:24	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
after	1
God	1
is	1
created	1
in	1
righteousness	1
and	1
true	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:25	1
Wherefore	1
putting	1
away	1
lying,	1
speak	1
every	1
man	1
truth	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
4:26	1
Be	1
ye	1
angry,	1
and	1
sin	1
not:	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
go	1
down	1
upon	1
your	1
wrath:	1
4:27	1
Neither	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:28	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
stole	1
steal	1
no	1
more:	1
but	1
rather	1
let	1
him	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
needeth.	1
	1
4:29	1
Let	1
no	1
corrupt	1
communication	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
edifying,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
minister	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
grieve	1
not	1
the	1
holy	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
whereby	1
ye	1
are	1
sealed	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
redemption.	1
	1
4:31	1
Let	1
all	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
wrath,	1
and	1
anger,	1
and	1
clamour,	1
and	1
evil	1
speaking,	1
be	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
with	1
all	1
malice:	1
4:32	1
And	1
be	1
ye	1
kind	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
tenderhearted,	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
God	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
hath	1
forgiven	1
you.	1
	1
5:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
followers	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
dear	1
children;	1
5:2	1
And	1
walk	1
in	1
love,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
himself	1
for	1
us	1
an	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
a	1
sweetsmelling	1
savour.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
fornication,	1
and	1
all	1
uncleanness,	1
or	1
covetousness,	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
once	1
named	1
among	1
you,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints;	1
5:4	1
Neither	1
filthiness,	1
nor	1
foolish	1
talking,	1
nor	1
jesting,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient:	1
but	1
rather	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks.	1
	1
5:5	1
For	1
this	1
ye	1
know,	1
that	1
no	1
whoremonger,	1
nor	1
unclean	1
person,	1
nor	1
covetous	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
idolater,	1
hath	1
any	1
inheritance	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Christ	1
and	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:6	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
with	1
vain	1
words:	1
for	1
because	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
cometh	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
partakers	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
sometimes	1
darkness,	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
walk	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
light:	1
5:9	1
(For	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
goodness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
and	1
truth;)	1
5:10	1
Proving	1
what	1
is	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
fellowship	1
with	1
the	1
unfruitful	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
but	1
rather	1
reprove	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
even	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
reproved	1
are	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
light:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
doth	1
make	1
manifest	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
5:14	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
Awake	1
thou	1
that	1
sleepest,	1
and	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
Christ	1
shall	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
then	1
that	1
ye	1
walk	1
circumspectly,	1
not	1
as	1
fools,	1
but	1
as	1
wise,	1
5:16	1
Redeeming	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
5:17	1
Wherefore	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
unwise,	1
but	1
understanding	1
what	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
drunk	1
with	1
wine,	1
wherein	1
is	1
excess;	1
but	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Spirit;	1
5:19	1
Speaking	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
and	1
making	1
melody	1
in	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
5:20	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
always	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
5:21	1
Submitting	1
yourselves	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:22	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:23	1
For	1
the	1
husband	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wife,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
church:	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
saviour	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
5:24	1
Therefore	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
subject	1
unto	1
Christ,	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
wives	1
be	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands	1
in	1
every	1
thing.	1
	1
5:25	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
loved	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
it;	1
5:26	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
and	1
cleanse	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
water	1
by	1
the	1
word,	1
5:27	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
glorious	1
church,	1
not	1
having	1
spot,	1
or	1
wrinkle,	1
or	1
any	1
such	1
thing;	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
holy	1
and	1
without	1
blemish.	1
	1
5:28	1
So	1
ought	1
men	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
wives	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
bodies.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
wife	1
loveth	1
himself.	1
	1
5:29	1
For	1
no	1
man	1
ever	1
yet	1
hated	1
his	1
own	1
flesh;	1
but	1
nourisheth	1
and	1
cherisheth	1
it,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
church:	1
5:30	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
members	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
5:31	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
unto	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
they	1
two	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
5:32	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
mystery:	1
but	1
I	1
speak	1
concerning	1
Christ	1
and	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
5:33	1
Nevertheless	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
particular	1
so	1
love	1
his	1
wife	1
even	1
as	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
reverence	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
6:1	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
right.	1
	1
6:2	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother;	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
with	1
promise;	1
6:3	1
That	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
well	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
live	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
And,	1
ye	1
fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
wrath:	1
but	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
nurture	1
and	1
admonition	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:5	1
Servants,	1
be	1
obedient	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling,	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
your	1
heart,	1
as	1
unto	1
Christ;	1
6:6	1
Not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Christ,	1
doing	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
6:7	1
With	1
good	1
will	1
doing	1
service,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
men:	1
6:8	1
Knowing	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
good	1
thing	1
any	1
man	1
doeth,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
he	1
receive	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free.	1
	1
6:9	1
And,	1
ye	1
masters,	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
forbearing	1
threatening:	1
knowing	1
that	1
your	1
Master	1
also	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
might.	1
	1
6:11	1
Put	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
we	1
wrestle	1
not	1
against	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
but	1
against	1
principalities,	1
against	1
powers,	1
against	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
against	1
spiritual	1
wickedness	1
in	1
high	1
places.	1
	1
6:13	1
Wherefore	1
take	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
armour	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
in	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
all,	1
to	1
stand.	1
	1
6:14	1
Stand	1
therefore,	1
having	1
your	1
loins	1
girt	1
about	1
with	1
truth,	1
and	1
having	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
righteousness;	1
6:15	1
And	1
your	1
feet	1
shod	1
with	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace;	1
6:16	1
Above	1
all,	1
taking	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
faith,	1
wherewith	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
quench	1
all	1
the	1
fiery	1
darts	1
of	1
the	1
wicked.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
take	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
6:18	1
Praying	1
always	1
with	1
all	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
watching	1
thereunto	1
with	1
all	1
perseverance	1
and	1
supplication	1
for	1
all	1
saints;	1
6:19	1
And	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
utterance	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
boldly,	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
6:20	1
For	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
ambassador	1
in	1
bonds:	1
that	1
therein	1
I	1
may	1
speak	1
boldly,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
6:21	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
know	1
my	1
affairs,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
do,	1
Tychicus,	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother	1
and	1
faithful	1
minister	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
things:	1
6:22	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
know	1
our	1
affairs,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
6:23	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
faith,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:24	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
sincerity.	1
	1
Amen.	1

from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
upon	1
every	1
remembrance	1
of	1
you,	1
1:4	1
Always	1
in	1
every	1
prayer	1
of	1
mine	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
making	1
request	1
with	1
joy,	1
1:5	1
For	1
your	1
fellowship	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
until	1
now;	1
1:6	1
Being	1
confident	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
begun	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
perform	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
this	1
of	1
you	1
all,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
heart;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
both	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
defence	1
and	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
my	1
grace.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
record,	1
how	1
greatly	1
I	1
long	1
after	1
you	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
pray,	1
that	1
your	1
love	1
may	1
abound	1
yet	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
in	1
knowledge	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
judgment;	1
1:10	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
approve	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
excellent;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
sincere	1
and	1
without	1
offence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:11	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
are	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
unto	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
ye	1
should	1
understand,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
unto	1
me	1
have	1
fallen	1
out	1
rather	1
unto	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:13	1
So	1
that	1
my	1
bonds	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
manifest	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
places;	1
1:14	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
waxing	1
confident	1
by	1
my	1
bonds,	1
are	1
much	1
more	1
bold	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
without	1
fear.	1
	1
1:15	1
Some	1
indeed	1
preach	1
Christ	1
even	1
of	1
envy	1
and	1
strife;	1
and	1
some	1
also	1
of	1
good	1
will:	1
1:16	1
The	1
one	1
preach	1
Christ	1
of	1
contention,	1
not	1
sincerely,	1
supposing	1
to	1
add	1
affliction	1
to	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:17	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
love,	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:18	1
What	1
then?	1
notwithstanding,	1
every	1
way,	1
whether	1
in	1
pretence,	1
or	1
in	1
truth,	1
Christ	1
is	1
preached;	1
and	1
I	1
therein	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
yea,	1
and	1
will	1
rejoice.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
salvation	1
through	1
your	1
prayer,	1
and	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
1:20	1
According	1
to	1
my	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
and	1
my	1
hope,	1
that	1
in	1
nothing	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
but	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness,	1
as	1
always,	1
so	1
now	1
also	1
Christ	1
shall	1
be	1
magnified	1
in	1
my	1
body,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
life,	1
or	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
is	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
die	1
is	1
gain.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
labour:	1
yet	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
I	1
wot	1
not.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
strait	1
betwixt	1
two,	1
having	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
depart,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
Christ;	1
which	1
is	1
far	1
better:	1
1:24	1
Nevertheless	1
to	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
more	1
needful	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
having	1
this	1
confidence,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
abide	1
and	1
continue	1
with	1
you	1
all	1
for	1
your	1
furtherance	1
and	1
joy	1
of	1
faith;	1
1:26	1
That	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
abundant	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
1:27	1
Only	1
let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
becometh	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
that	1
whether	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you,	1
or	1
else	1
be	1
absent,	1
I	1
may	1
hear	1
of	1
your	1
affairs,	1
that	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
one	1
spirit,	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
striving	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:28	1
And	1
in	1
nothing	1
terrified	1
by	1
your	1
adversaries:	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
evident	1
token	1
of	1
perdition,	1
but	1
to	1
you	1
of	1
salvation,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:29	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
behalf	1
of	1
Christ,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
believe	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
his	1
sake;	1
1:30	1
Having	1
the	1
same	1
conflict	1
which	1
ye	1
saw	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
now	1
hear	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
2:1	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
therefore	1
any	1
consolation	1
in	1
Christ,	1
if	1
any	1
comfort	1
of	1
love,	1
if	1
any	1
fellowship	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
any	1
bowels	1
and	1
mercies,	1
2:2	1
Fulfil	1
ye	1
my	1
joy,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
likeminded,	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
love,	1
being	1
of	1
one	1
accord,	1
of	1
one	1
mind.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
nothing	1
be	1
done	1
through	1
strife	1
or	1
vainglory;	1
but	1
in	1
lowliness	1
of	1
mind	1
let	1
each	1
esteem	1
other	1
better	1
than	1
themselves.	1
	1
2:4	1
Look	1
not	1
every	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
things,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
others.	1
	1
2:5	1
Let	1
this	1
mind	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
2:6	1
Who,	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
God,	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
robbery	1
to	1
be	1
equal	1
with	1
God:	1
2:7	1
But	1
made	1
himself	1
of	1
no	1
reputation,	1
and	1
took	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men:	1
2:8	1
And	1
being	1
found	1
in	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
humbled	1
himself,	1
and	1
became	1
obedient	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
2:9	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
hath	1
highly	1
exalted	1
him,	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
above	1
every	1
name:	1
2:10	1
That	1
at	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
every	1
knee	1
should	1
bow,	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
and	1
things	1
under	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:11	1
And	1
that	1
every	1
tongue	1
should	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
Lord,	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:12	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
always	1
obeyed,	1
not	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
only,	1
but	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
absence,	1
work	1
out	1
your	1
own	1
salvation	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
will	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
pleasure.	1
	1
2:14	1
Do	1
all	1
things	1
without	1
murmurings	1
and	1
disputings:	1
2:15	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
and	1
harmless,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
rebuke,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
crooked	1
and	1
perverse	1
nation,	1
among	1
whom	1
ye	1
shine	1
as	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
2:16	1
Holding	1
forth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
run	1
in	1
vain,	1
neither	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
2:17	1
Yea,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
offered	1
upon	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
service	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
I	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
also	1
do	1
ye	1
joy,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
to	1
send	1
Timotheus	1
shortly	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
when	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
likeminded,	1
who	1
will	1
naturally	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
state.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
all	1
seek	1
their	1
own,	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Jesus	1
Christ's.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
ye	1
know	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
him,	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
father,	1
he	1
hath	1
served	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:23	1
Him	1
therefore	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
send	1
presently,	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
also	1
myself	1
shall	1
come	1
shortly.	1
	1
2:25	1
Yet	1
I	1
supposed	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
you	1
Epaphroditus,	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
companion	1
in	1
labour,	1
and	1
fellowsoldier,	1
but	1
your	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
ministered	1
to	1
my	1
wants.	1
	1
2:26	1
For	1
he	1
longed	1
after	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
heaviness,	1
because	1
that	1
ye	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
2:27	1
For	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death:	1
but	1
God	1
had	1
mercy	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
only,	1
but	1
on	1
me	1
also,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
sorrow	1
upon	1
sorrow.	1
	1
2:28	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
therefore	1
the	1
more	1
carefully,	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
again,	1
ye	1
may	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
sorrowful.	1
	1
2:29	1
Receive	1
him	1
therefore	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
gladness;	1
and	1
hold	1
such	1
in	1
reputation:	1
2:30	1
Because	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Christ	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
death,	1
not	1
regarding	1
his	1
life,	1
to	1
supply	1
your	1
lack	1
of	1
service	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
To	1
write	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
me	1
indeed	1
is	1
not	1
grievous,	1
but	1
for	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
safe.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beware	1
of	1
dogs,	1
beware	1
of	1
evil	1
workers,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
concision.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
worship	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:4	1
Though	1
I	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
If	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
thinketh	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
he	1
might	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
I	1
more:	1
3:5	1
Circumcised	1
the	1
eighth	1
day,	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Israel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
an	1
Hebrew	1
of	1
the	1
Hebrews;	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
law,	1
a	1
Pharisee;	1
3:6	1
Concerning	1
zeal,	1
persecuting	1
the	1
church;	1
touching	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
gain	1
to	1
me,	1
those	1
I	1
counted	1
loss	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:8	1
Yea	1
doubtless,	1
and	1
I	1
count	1
all	1
things	1
but	1
loss	1
for	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
my	1
Lord:	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
do	1
count	1
them	1
but	1
dung,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
win	1
Christ,	1
3:9	1
And	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
him,	1
not	1
having	1
mine	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Christ,	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
faith:	1
3:10	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
sufferings,	1
being	1
made	1
conformable	1
unto	1
his	1
death;	1
3:11	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
might	1
attain	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
attained,	1
either	1
were	1
already	1
perfect:	1
but	1
I	1
follow	1
after,	1
if	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
apprehend	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
apprehended	1
of	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:13	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
count	1
not	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
apprehended:	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
do,	1
forgetting	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
behind,	1
and	1
reaching	1
forth	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
before,	1
3:14	1
I	1
press	1
toward	1
the	1
mark	1
for	1
the	1
prize	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:15	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
be	1
perfect,	1
be	1
thus	1
minded:	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
thing	1
ye	1
be	1
otherwise	1
minded,	1
God	1
shall	1
reveal	1
even	1
this	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:16	1
Nevertheless,	1
whereto	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
attained,	1
let	1
us	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rule,	1
let	1
us	1
mind	1
the	1
same	1
thing.	1
	1
3:17	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
followers	1
together	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
walk	1
so	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
ensample.	1
	1
3:18	1
(For	1
many	1
walk,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
often,	1
and	1
now	1
tell	1
you	1
even	1
weeping,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ:	1
3:19	1
Whose	1
end	1
is	1
destruction,	1
whose	1
God	1
is	1
their	1
belly,	1
and	1
whose	1
glory	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
shame,	1
who	1
mind	1
earthly	1
things.)	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
our	1
conversation	1
is	1
in	1
heaven;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Saviour,	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:21	1
Who	1
shall	1
change	1
our	1
vile	1
body,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fashioned	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
glorious	1
body,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
working	1
whereby	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
even	1
to	1
subdue	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself.	1
	1
4:1	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
brethren	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
and	1
longed	1
for,	1
my	1
joy	1
and	1
crown,	1
so	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
beseech	1
Euodias,	1
and	1
beseech	1
Syntyche,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
I	1
intreat	1
thee	1
also,	1
true	1
yokefellow,	1
help	1
those	1
women	1
which	1
laboured	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
gospel,	1
with	1
Clement	1
also,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
my	1
fellowlabourers,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
4:4	1
Rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
alway:	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say,	1
Rejoice.	1
	1
4:5	1
Let	1
your	1
moderation	1
be	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:6	1
Be	1
careful	1
for	1
nothing;	1
but	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
let	1
your	1
requests	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
passeth	1
all	1
understanding,	1
shall	1
keep	1
your	1
hearts	1
and	1
minds	1
through	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:8	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
true,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
honest,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
just,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
pure,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
lovely,	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
are	1
of	1
good	1
report;	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
virtue,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
praise,	1
think	1
on	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
4:9	1
Those	1
things,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
both	1
learned,	1
and	1
received,	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
seen	1
in	1
me,	1
do:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
But	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
greatly,	1
that	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
your	1
care	1
of	1
me	1
hath	1
flourished	1
again;	1
wherein	1
ye	1
were	1
also	1
careful,	1
but	1
ye	1
lacked	1
opportunity.	1
	1
4:11	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
want:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned,	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
state	1
I	1
am,	1
therewith	1
to	1
be	1
content.	1
	1
4:12	1
I	1
know	1
both	1
how	1
to	1
be	1
abased,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
abound:	1
every	1
where	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
instructed	1
both	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
hungry,	1
both	1
to	1
abound	1
and	1
to	1
suffer	1
need.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
all	1
things	1
through	1
Christ	1
which	1
strengtheneth	1
me.	1
	1
4:14	1
Notwithstanding	1
ye	1
have	1
well	1
done,	1
that	1
ye	1
did	1
communicate	1
with	1
my	1
affliction.	1
	1
4:15	1
Now	1
ye	1
Philippians	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
when	1
I	1
departed	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
no	1
church	1
communicated	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
concerning	1
giving	1
and	1
receiving,	1
but	1
ye	1
only.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
even	1
in	1
Thessalonica	1
ye	1
sent	1
once	1
and	1
again	1
unto	1
my	1
necessity.	1
	1
4:17	1
Not	1
because	1
I	1
desire	1
a	1
gift:	1
but	1
I	1
desire	1
fruit	1
that	1
may	1
abound	1
to	1
your	1
account.	1
	1
4:18	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
all,	1
and	1
abound:	1
I	1
am	1
full,	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
Epaphroditus	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
you,	1
an	1
odour	1
of	1
a	1
sweet	1
smell,	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
acceptable,	1
wellpleasing	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
supply	1
all	1
your	1
need	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
riches	1
in	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Now	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:21	1
Salute	1
every	1
saint	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
The	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:22	1
All	1
the	1
saints	1
salute	1
you,	1
chiefly	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
Caesar's	1
household.	1
	1
4:23	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

The	1

	1
Paul,	1
an	1

by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
our	1

1:2	1
	1
To	1
the	1

and	1
faithful	1
brethren	1
in	1

which	1
are	1
at	1

Grace	1

unto	1
you,	1

peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1

	1
1:3	1
	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
praying	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
1:4	1
	1
Since	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
saints,	1
1:5	1
	1
For	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
heaven,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
heard	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
gospel;	1
1:6	1
	1
Which	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
as	1
it	1
doth	1
also	1
in	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
knew	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
also	1
learned	1
of	1
Epaphras	1
our	1
dear	1
fellowservant,	1
who	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
of	1
Christ;	1
1:8	1
	1
Who	1
also	1
declared	1
unto	1
us	1
your	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:9	1
	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
we	1
also,	1
since	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
do	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
desire	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom	1
and	1
spiritual	1
understanding;	1
1:10	1
	1
That	1
ye	1
might	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
unto	1
all	1
pleasing,	1
being	1
fruitful	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
and	1
increasing	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God;	1
1:11	1
	1
Strengthened	1
with	1
all	1
might,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
glorious	1
power,	1
unto	1
all	1
patience	1
and	1
longsuffering	1
with	1
joyfulness;	1
1:12	1
	1
Giving	1
thanks	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
in	1
light:	1
1:13	1
	1
Who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
hath	1
translated	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
Son:	1
1:14	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
redemption	1
through	1
his	1
blood,	1
even	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
1:15	1
	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
invisible	1
God,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
of	1
every	1
creature:	1
1:16	1
	1
For	1
by	1
him	1
were	1
all	1
things	1
created,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
earth,	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
thrones,	1
or	1
dominions,	1
or	1
principalities,	1
or	1
powers:	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
created	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
for	1
him:	1
1:17	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
before	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
consist.	1
	1
1:18	1
	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
the	1
church:	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
firstborn	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence.	1
	1
1:19	1
	1
For	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
all	1
fulness	1
dwell;	1
1:20	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
made	1
peace	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
cross,	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
reconcile	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
himself;	1
by	1
him,	1
I	1
say,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
things	1
in	1
earth,	1
or	1
things	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:21	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
that	1
were	1
sometime	1
alienated	1
and	1
enemies	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
by	1
wicked	1
works,	1
yet	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
reconciled	1
1:22	1
	1
In	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
through	1
death,	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
holy	1
and	1
unblameable	1
and	1
unreproveable	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
1:23	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
grounded	1
and	1
settled,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
preached	1
to	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
under	1
heaven;	1
whereof	1
I	1
Paul	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister;	1
1:24	1
	1
Who	1
now	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
sufferings	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
fill	1
up	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
behind	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
Christ	1
in	1
my	1
flesh	1
for	1
his	1
body's	1
sake,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church:	1
1:25	1
	1
Whereof	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
a	1
minister,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God;	1
1:26	1
	1
Even	1
the	1
mystery	1
which	1
hath	1
been	1
hid	1
from	1
ages	1
and	1
from	1
generations,	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
his	1
saints:	1
1:27	1
	1
To	1
whom	1
God	1
would	1
make	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
mystery	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:28	1
	1
Whom	1
we	1
preach,	1
warning	1
every	1
man,	1
and	1
teaching	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
present	1
every	1
man	1
perfect	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
1:29	1
	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
also	1
labour,	1
striving	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
working,	1
which	1
worketh	1
in	1
me	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:1	1
	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
knew	1
what	1
great	1
conflict	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
my	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
flesh;	1
2:2	1
	1
That	1
their	1
hearts	1
might	1
be	1
comforted,	1
being	1
knit	1
together	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
understanding,	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledgement	1
of	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
Christ;	1
2:3	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
are	1
hid	1
all	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge.	1
	1
2:4	1
	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
beguile	1
you	1
with	1
enticing	1
words.	1
	1
2:5	1
	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
absent	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
joying	1
and	1
beholding	1
your	1
order,	1
and	1
the	1
stedfastness	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
	1
As	1
ye	1
have	1
therefore	1
received	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Lord,	1
so	1
walk	1
ye	1
in	1
him:	1
2:7	1
	1
Rooted	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
stablished	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
abounding	1
therein	1
with	1
thanksgiving.	1
	1
2:8	1
	1
Beware	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
spoil	1
you	1
through	1
philosophy	1
and	1
vain	1
deceit,	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
after	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:9	1
	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
dwelleth	1
all	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Godhead	1
bodily.	1
	1
2:10	1
	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
complete	1
in	1
him,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
all	1
principality	1
and	1
power:	1
2:11	1
	1
In	1
whom	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
circumcised	1
with	1
the	1
circumcision	1
made	1
without	1
hands,	1
in	1
putting	1
off	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
by	1
the	1
circumcision	1
of	1
Christ:	1
2:12	1
	1
Buried	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
baptism,	1
wherein	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
risen	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
2:13	1
	1
And	1
you,	1
being	1
dead	1
in	1
your	1
sins	1
and	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
he	1
quickened	1
together	1
with	1
him,	1
having	1
forgiven	1
you	1
all	1
trespasses;	1
2:14	1
	1
Blotting	1
out	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
ordinances	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
us,	1
which	1
was	1
contrary	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
nailing	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
cross;	1
2:15	1
	1
And	1
having	1
spoiled	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
them	1
openly,	1
triumphing	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
2:16	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
therefore	1
judge	1
you	1
in	1
meat,	1
or	1
in	1
drink,	1
or	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
an	1
holyday,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
moon,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days:	1
2:17	1
	1
Which	1
are	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
but	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:18	1
	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
beguile	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
a	1
voluntary	1
humility	1
and	1
worshipping	1
of	1
angels,	1
intruding	1
into	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
vainly	1
puffed	1
up	1
by	1
his	1
fleshly	1
mind,	1
2:19	1
	1
And	1
not	1
holding	1
the	1
Head,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
joints	1
and	1
bands	1
having	1
nourishment	1
ministered,	1
and	1
knit	1
together,	1
increaseth	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:20	1
	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
rudiments	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
why,	1
as	1
though	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
are	1
ye	1
subject	1
to	1
ordinances,	1
2:21	1
	1
(Touch	1
not;	1
taste	1
not;	1
handle	1
not;	1
2:22	1
	1
Which	1
all	1
are	1
to	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
using;)	1
after	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
men?	1
2:23	1
	1
Which	1
things	1
have	1
indeed	1
a	1
shew	1
of	1
wisdom	1
in	1
will	1
worship,	1
and	1
humility,	1
and	1
neglecting	1
of	1
the	1
body:	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
honour	1
to	1
the	1
satisfying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
3:1	1
	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
risen	1
with	1
Christ,	1
seek	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
above,	1
where	1
Christ	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:2	1
	1
Set	1
your	1
affection	1
on	1
things	1
above,	1
not	1
on	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:3	1
	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
hid	1
with	1
Christ	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
	1
When	1
Christ,	1
who	1
is	1
our	1
life,	1
shall	1
appear,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
also	1
appear	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
3:5	1
	1
Mortify	1
therefore	1
your	1
members	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
fornication,	1
uncleanness,	1
inordinate	1
affection,	1
evil	1
concupiscence,	1
and	1
covetousness,	1
which	1
is	1
idolatry:	1
3:6	1
	1
For	1
which	1
things'	1
sake	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
on	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
disobedience:	1
3:7	1
	1
In	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
walked	1
some	1
time,	1
when	1
ye	1
lived	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
3:8	1
	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
also	1
put	1
off	1
all	1
these;	1
anger,	1
wrath,	1
malice,	1
blasphemy,	1
filthy	1
communication	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:9	1
	1
Lie	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
deeds;	1
3:10	1
	1
And	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
man,	1
which	1
is	1
renewed	1
in	1
knowledge	1
after	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
created	1
him:	1
3:11	1
	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
Greek	1
nor	1
Jew,	1
circumcision	1
nor	1
uncircumcision,	1
Barbarian,	1
Scythian,	1
bond	1
nor	1
free:	1
but	1
Christ	1
is	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
3:12	1
	1
Put	1
on	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
elect	1
of	1
God,	1
holy	1
and	1
beloved,	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercies,	1
kindness,	1
humbleness	1
of	1
mind,	1
meekness,	1
longsuffering;	1
3:13	1
	1
Forbearing	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
forgiving	1
one	1
another,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
any:	1
even	1
as	1
Christ	1
forgave	1
you,	1
so	1
also	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
3:14	1
	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
on	1
charity,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
perfectness.	1
	1
3:15	1
	1
And	1
let	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
rule	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
to	1
the	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
one	1
body;	1
and	1
be	1
ye	1
thankful.	1
	1
3:16	1
	1
Let	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Christ	1
dwell	1
in	1
you	1
richly	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom;	1
teaching	1
and	1
admonishing	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
psalms	1
and	1
hymns	1
and	1
spiritual	1
songs,	1
singing	1
with	1
grace	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:17	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
deed,	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
	1
Wives,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
your	1
own	1
husbands,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
fit	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:19	1
	1
Husbands,	1
love	1
your	1
wives,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
bitter	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
3:20	1
	1
Children,	1
obey	1
your	1
parents	1
in	1
all	1
things:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
well	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:21	1
	1
Fathers,	1
provoke	1
not	1
your	1
children	1
to	1
anger,	1
lest	1
they	1
be	1
discouraged.	1
	1
3:22	1
	1
Servants,	1
obey	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
your	1
masters	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
not	1
with	1
eyeservice,	1
as	1
menpleasers;	1
but	1
in	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
fearing	1
God;	1
3:23	1
	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
it	1
heartily,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
men;	1
3:24	1
	1
Knowing	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance:	1
for	1
ye	1
serve	1
the	1
Lord	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:25	1
	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
wrong	1
shall	1
receive	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
done:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
4:1	1
	1
Masters,	1
give	1
unto	1
your	1
servants	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
and	1
equal;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
a	1
Master	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
4:2	1
	1
Continue	1
in	1
prayer,	1
and	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
thanksgiving;	1
4:3	1
	1
Withal	1
praying	1
also	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
God	1
would	1
open	1
unto	1
us	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
utterance,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
Christ,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
in	1
bonds:	1
4:4	1
	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
manifest,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
4:5	1
	1
Walk	1
in	1
wisdom	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
redeeming	1
the	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
	1
Let	1
your	1
speech	1
be	1
alway	1
with	1
grace,	1
seasoned	1
with	1
salt,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
answer	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
4:7	1
	1
All	1
my	1
state	1
shall	1
Tychicus	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
and	1
a	1
faithful	1
minister	1
and	1
fellowservant	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
4:8	1
	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
your	1
estate,	1
and	1
comfort	1
your	1
hearts;	1
4:9	1
	1
With	1
Onesimus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you.	1
They	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
done	1
here.	1
	1
4:10	1
	1
Aristarchus	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Marcus,	1
sister's	1
son	1
to	1
Barnabas,	1
(touching	1
whom	1
ye	1
received	1
commandments:	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
receive	1
him;)	1
4:11	1
	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Justus,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision.	1
These	1
only	1
are	1
my	1
fellowworkers	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
comfort	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:12	1
	1
Epaphras,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Christ,	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
always	1
labouring	1
fervently	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
prayers,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
stand	1
perfect	1
and	1
complete	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
him	1
record,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
great	1
zeal	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
them	1
in	1
Hierapolis.	1
	1
4:14	1
	1
Luke,	1
the	1
beloved	1
physician,	1
and	1
Demas,	1
greet	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
	1
Salute	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Laodicea,	1
and	1
Nymphas,	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
4:16	1
	1
And	1
when	1
this	1
epistle	1
is	1
read	1
among	1
you,	1
cause	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
read	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Laodiceans;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
likewise	1
read	1
the	1
epistle	1
from	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
4:17	1
	1
And	1
say	1
to	1
Archippus,	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
thou	1
fulfil	1
it.	1
	1
4:18	1
	1
The	1
salutation	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
me	1
Paul.	1
Remember	1
my	1

Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:2	1
We	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
our	1
prayers;	1
1:3	1
Remembering	1
without	1
ceasing	1
your	1
work	1
of	1
faith,	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
hope	1
in	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Father;	1
1:4	1
Knowing,	1
brethren	1
beloved,	1
your	1
election	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
our	1
gospel	1
came	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
word	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
assurance;	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
we	1
were	1
among	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
sake.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
ye	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
much	1
affliction,	1
with	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
ensamples	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
from	1
you	1
sounded	1
out	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
but	1
also	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
your	1
faith	1
to	1
God-ward	1
is	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
any	1
thing.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
they	1
themselves	1
shew	1
of	1
us	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
entering	1
in	1
we	1
had	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
ye	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
from	1
idols	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
true	1
God;	1
1:10	1
And	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
Son	1
from	1
heaven,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
delivered	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
2:1	1
For	1
yourselves,	1
brethren,	1
know	1
our	1
entrance	1
in	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain:	1
2:2	1
But	1
even	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
suffered	1
before,	1
and	1
were	1
shamefully	1
entreated,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
at	1
Philippi,	1
we	1
were	1
bold	1
in	1
our	1
God	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
much	1
contention.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
our	1
exhortation	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
deceit,	1
nor	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
nor	1
in	1
guile:	1
2:4	1
But	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
allowed	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
trust	1
with	1
the	1
gospel,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
speak;	1
not	1
as	1
pleasing	1
men,	1
but	1
God,	1
which	1
trieth	1
our	1
hearts.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
neither	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
used	1
we	1
flattering	1
words,	1
as	1
ye	1
know,	1
nor	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
covetousness;	1
God	1
is	1
witness:	1
2:6	1
Nor	1
of	1
men	1
sought	1
we	1
glory,	1
neither	1
of	1
you,	1
nor	1
yet	1
of	1
others,	1
when	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
burdensome,	1
as	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
gentle	1
among	1
you,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
nurse	1
cherisheth	1
her	1
children:	1
2:8	1
So	1
being	1
affectionately	1
desirous	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
imparted	1
unto	1
you,	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
our	1
own	1
souls,	1
because	1
ye	1
were	1
dear	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:9	1
For	1
ye	1
remember,	1
brethren,	1
our	1
labour	1
and	1
travail:	1
for	1
labouring	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
because	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
unto	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
we	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:10	1
Ye	1
are	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
God	1
also,	1
how	1
holily	1
and	1
justly	1
and	1
unblameably	1
we	1
behaved	1
ourselves	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
believe:	1
2:11	1
As	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
exhorted	1
and	1
comforted	1
and	1
charged	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
father	1
doth	1
his	1
children,	1
2:12	1
That	1
ye	1
would	1
walk	1
worthy	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
unto	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
also	1
thank	1
we	1
God	1
without	1
ceasing,	1
because,	1
when	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
ye	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
ye	1
received	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
truth,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
effectually	1
worketh	1
also	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
became	1
followers	1
of	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
in	1
Judaea	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
for	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
suffered	1
like	1
things	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
2:15	1
Who	1
both	1
killed	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
prophets,	1
and	1
have	1
persecuted	1
us;	1
and	1
they	1
please	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
men:	1
2:16	1
Forbidding	1
us	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved,	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
their	1
sins	1
alway:	1
for	1
the	1
wrath	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost.	1
	1
2:17	1
But	1
we,	1
brethren,	1
being	1
taken	1
from	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
in	1
presence,	1
not	1
in	1
heart,	1
endeavoured	1
the	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
face	1
with	1
great	1
desire.	1
	1
2:18	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
even	1
I	1
Paul,	1
once	1
and	1
again;	1
but	1
Satan	1
hindered	1
us.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
our	1
hope,	1
or	1
joy,	1
or	1
crown	1
of	1
rejoicing?	1
Are	1
not	1
even	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
at	1
his	1
coming?	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
our	1
glory	1
and	1
joy.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
we	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
Athens	1
alone;	1
3:2	1
And	1
sent	1
Timotheus,	1
our	1
brother,	1
and	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
fellowlabourer	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ,	1
to	1
establish	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
comfort	1
you	1
concerning	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:3	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
moved	1
by	1
these	1
afflictions:	1
for	1
yourselves	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
appointed	1
thereunto.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
verily,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
we	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
suffer	1
tribulation;	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause,	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
forbear,	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
faith,	1
lest	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
the	1
tempter	1
have	1
tempted	1
you,	1
and	1
our	1
labour	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
3:6	1
But	1
now	1
when	1
Timotheus	1
came	1
from	1
you	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
good	1
remembrance	1
of	1
us	1
always,	1
desiring	1
greatly	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
to	1
see	1
you:	1
3:7	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
were	1
comforted	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
our	1
affliction	1
and	1
distress	1
by	1
your	1
faith:	1
3:8	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
live,	1
if	1
ye	1
stand	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
what	1
thanks	1
can	1
we	1
render	1
to	1
God	1
again	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
joy	1
wherewith	1
we	1
joy	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
before	1
our	1
God;	1
3:10	1
Night	1
and	1
day	1
praying	1
exceedingly	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
see	1
your	1
face,	1
and	1
might	1
perfect	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lacking	1
in	1
your	1
faith?	1
	1
3:11	1
Now	1
God	1
himself	1
and	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
direct	1
our	1
way	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
increase	1
and	1
abound	1
in	1
love	1
one	1
toward	1
another,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
men,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
toward	1
you:	1
3:13	1
To	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
may	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts	1
unblameable	1
in	1
holiness	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
at	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
saints.	1
	1
4:1	1
Furthermore	1
then	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
us	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
walk	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
God,	1
so	1
ye	1
would	1
abound	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
commandments	1
we	1
gave	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
your	1
sanctification,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
abstain	1
from	1
fornication:	1
4:4	1
That	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
possess	1
his	1
vessel	1
in	1
sanctification	1
and	1
honour;	1
4:5	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
concupiscence,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
know	1
not	1
God:	1
4:6	1
That	1
no	1
man	1
go	1
beyond	1
and	1
defraud	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
any	1
matter:	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
the	1
avenger	1
of	1
all	1
such,	1
as	1
we	1
also	1
have	1
forewarned	1
you	1
and	1
testified.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
uncleanness,	1
but	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
therefore	1
that	1
despiseth,	1
despiseth	1
not	1
man,	1
but	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
also	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
his	1
holy	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:9	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
brotherly	1
love	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
are	1
taught	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
indeed	1
ye	1
do	1
it	1
toward	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
Macedonia:	1
but	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
increase	1
more	1
and	1
more;	1
4:11	1
And	1
that	1
ye	1
study	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
hands,	1
as	1
we	1
commanded	1
you;	1
4:12	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
walk	1
honestly	1
toward	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
have	1
lack	1
of	1
nothing.	1
	1
4:13	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
concerning	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep,	1
that	1
ye	1
sorrow	1
not,	1
even	1
as	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
hope.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
died	1
and	1
rose	1
again,	1
even	1
so	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
sleep	1
in	1
Jesus	1
will	1
God	1
bring	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
this	1
we	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
not	1
prevent	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
asleep.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
the	1
Lord	1
himself	1
shall	1
descend	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
archangel,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
trump	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
rise	1
first:	1
4:17	1
Then	1
we	1
which	1
are	1
alive	1
and	1
remain	1
shall	1
be	1
caught	1
up	1
together	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
clouds,	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
air:	1
and	1
so	1
shall	1
we	1
ever	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:18	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
these	1
words.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons,	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
perfectly	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
so	1
cometh	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Peace	1
and	1
safety;	1
then	1
sudden	1
destruction	1
cometh	1
upon	1
them,	1
as	1
travail	1
upon	1
a	1
woman	1
with	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
that	1
day	1
should	1
overtake	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
nor	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
5:6	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
sleep,	1
as	1
do	1
others;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
watch	1
and	1
be	1
sober.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
sleep	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
drunken	1
are	1
drunken	1
in	1
the	1
night.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
let	1
us,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
be	1
sober,	1
putting	1
on	1
the	1
breastplate	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
love;	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
helmet,	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
appointed	1
us	1
to	1
wrath,	1
but	1
to	1
obtain	1
salvation	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:10	1
Who	1
died	1
for	1
us,	1
that,	1
whether	1
we	1
wake	1
or	1
sleep,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
together	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:11	1
Wherefore	1
comfort	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
and	1
edify	1
one	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
to	1
know	1
them	1
which	1
labour	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
are	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
admonish	1
you;	1
5:13	1
And	1
to	1
esteem	1
them	1
very	1
highly	1
in	1
love	1
for	1
their	1
work's	1
sake.	1
And	1
be	1
at	1
peace	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:14	1
Now	1
we	1
exhort	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
warn	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
unruly,	1
comfort	1
the	1
feebleminded,	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
be	1
patient	1
toward	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:15	1
See	1
that	1
none	1
render	1
evil	1
for	1
evil	1
unto	1
any	1
man;	1
but	1
ever	1
follow	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
both	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
5:16	1
Rejoice	1
evermore.	1
	1
5:17	1
Pray	1
without	1
ceasing.	1
	1
5:18	1
In	1
every	1
thing	1
give	1
thanks:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
concerning	1
you.	1
	1
5:19	1
Quench	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
5:20	1
Despise	1
not	1
prophesyings.	1
	1
5:21	1
Prove	1
all	1
things;	1
hold	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
5:22	1
Abstain	1
from	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:23	1
And	1
the	1
very	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
sanctify	1
you	1
wholly;	1
and	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
your	1
whole	1
spirit	1
and	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
be	1
preserved	1
blameless	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
5:24	1
Faithful	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
you,	1
who	1
also	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
5:25	1
Brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:26	1
Greet	1
all	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
	1
5:27	1
I	1
charge	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
this	1
epistle	1
be	1
read	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
brethren.	1
	1
5:28	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
and	1
Silvanus,	1
and	1
Timotheus,	1
unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians	1
in	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:3	1
We	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
thank	1
God	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
meet,	1
because	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
groweth	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
the	1
charity	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
all	1
toward	1
each	1
other	1
aboundeth;	1
1:4	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
ourselves	1
glory	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
your	1
patience	1
and	1
faith	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
persecutions	1
and	1
tribulations	1
that	1
ye	1
endure:	1
1:5	1
Which	1
is	1
a	1
manifest	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
for	1
which	1
ye	1
also	1
suffer:	1
1:6	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
righteous	1
thing	1
with	1
God	1
to	1
recompense	1
tribulation	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
trouble	1
you;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
troubled	1
rest	1
with	1
us,	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
with	1
his	1
mighty	1
angels,	1
1:8	1
In	1
flaming	1
fire	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
not	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:9	1
Who	1
shall	1
be	1
punished	1
with	1
everlasting	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
power;	1
1:10	1
When	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
his	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
admired	1
in	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
(because	1
our	1
testimony	1
among	1
you	1
was	1
believed)	1
in	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:11	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
we	1
pray	1
always	1
for	1
you,	1
that	1
our	1
God	1
would	1
count	1
you	1
worthy	1
of	1
this	1
calling,	1
and	1
fulfil	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
faith	1
with	1
power:	1
1:12	1
That	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
we	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
gathering	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
2:2	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
soon	1
shaken	1
in	1
mind,	1
or	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
by	1
spirit,	1
nor	1
by	1
word,	1
nor	1
by	1
letter	1
as	1
from	1
us,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
2:3	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you	1
by	1
any	1
means:	1
for	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
not	1
come,	1
except	1
there	1
come	1
a	1
falling	1
away	1
first,	1
and	1
that	1
man	1
of	1
sin	1
be	1
revealed,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
opposeth	1
and	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
God,	1
or	1
that	1
is	1
worshipped;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
as	1
God	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
shewing	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
ye	1
not,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
now	1
ye	1
know	1
what	1
withholdeth	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
iniquity	1
doth	1
already	1
work:	1
only	1
he	1
who	1
now	1
letteth	1
will	1
let,	1
until	1
he	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
that	1
Wicked	1
be	1
revealed,	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
consume	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
with	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
coming:	1
2:9	1
Even	1
him,	1
whose	1
coming	1
is	1
after	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
Satan	1
with	1
all	1
power	1
and	1
signs	1
and	1
lying	1
wonders,	1
2:10	1
And	1
with	1
all	1
deceivableness	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
perish;	1
because	1
they	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
shall	1
send	1
them	1
strong	1
delusion,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
a	1
lie:	1
2:12	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
might	1
be	1
damned	1
who	1
believed	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
had	1
pleasure	1
in	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
2:13	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
alway	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
you,	1
brethren	1
beloved	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
because	1
God	1
hath	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
chosen	1
you	1
to	1
salvation	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
truth:	1
2:14	1
Whereunto	1
he	1
called	1
you	1
by	1
our	1
gospel,	1
to	1
the	1
obtaining	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:15	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
stand	1
fast,	1
and	1
hold	1
the	1
traditions	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
taught,	1
whether	1
by	1
word,	1
or	1
our	1
epistle.	1
	1
2:16	1
Now	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself,	1
and	1
God,	1
even	1
our	1
Father,	1
which	1
hath	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
everlasting	1
consolation	1
and	1
good	1
hope	1
through	1
grace,	1
2:17	1
Comfort	1
your	1
hearts,	1
and	1
stablish	1
you	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
word	1
and	1
work.	1
	1
3:1	1
Finally,	1
brethren,	1
pray	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
may	1
have	1
free	1
course,	1
and	1
be	1
glorified,	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
you:	1
3:2	1
And	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
unreasonable	1
and	1
wicked	1
men:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
have	1
not	1
faith.	1
	1
3:3	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
shall	1
stablish	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
touching	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
both	1
do	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
direct	1
your	1
hearts	1
into	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
patient	1
waiting	1
for	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:6	1
Now	1
we	1
command	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
withdraw	1
yourselves	1
from	1
every	1
brother	1
that	1
walketh	1
disorderly,	1
and	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
tradition	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
yourselves	1
know	1
how	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
follow	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
behaved	1
not	1
ourselves	1
disorderly	1
among	1
you;	1
3:8	1
Neither	1
did	1
we	1
eat	1
any	1
man's	1
bread	1
for	1
nought;	1
but	1
wrought	1
with	1
labour	1
and	1
travail	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
chargeable	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
you:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
power,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
ourselves	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
us.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
you,	1
this	1
we	1
commanded	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
would	1
not	1
work,	1
neither	1
should	1
he	1
eat.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
we	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
walk	1
among	1
you	1
disorderly,	1
working	1
not	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
are	1
busybodies.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
we	1
command	1
and	1
exhort	1
by	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
with	1
quietness	1
they	1
work,	1
and	1
eat	1
their	1
own	1
bread.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
ye,	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
weary	1
in	1
well	1
doing.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
obey	1
not	1
our	1
word	1
by	1
this	1
epistle,	1
note	1
that	1
man,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
3:15	1
Yet	1
count	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
an	1
enemy,	1
but	1
admonish	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
3:16	1
Now	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
peace	1
himself	1
give	1
you	1
peace	1
always	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
The	1
Lord	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
salutation	1
of	1
Paul	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
token	1
in	1
every	1
epistle:	1
so	1
I	1
write.	1
	1
3:18	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
and	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
hope;	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
in	1
the	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
As	1
I	1
besought	1
thee	1
to	1
abide	1
still	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
charge	1
some	1
that	1
they	1
teach	1
no	1
other	1
doctrine,	1
1:4	1
Neither	1
give	1
heed	1
to	1
fables	1
and	1
endless	1
genealogies,	1
which	1
minister	1
questions,	1
rather	1
than	1
godly	1
edifying	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
faith:	1
so	1
do.	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
is	1
charity	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
unfeigned:	1
1:6	1
From	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
swerved	1
have	1
turned	1
aside	1
unto	1
vain	1
jangling;	1
1:7	1
Desiring	1
to	1
be	1
teachers	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
understanding	1
neither	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
nor	1
whereof	1
they	1
affirm.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
good,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
use	1
it	1
lawfully;	1
1:9	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
lawless	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
for	1
sinners,	1
for	1
unholy	1
and	1
profane,	1
for	1
murderers	1
of	1
fathers	1
and	1
murderers	1
of	1
mothers,	1
for	1
manslayers,	1
1:10	1
For	1
whoremongers,	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
defile	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
for	1
menstealers,	1
for	1
liars,	1
for	1
perjured	1
persons,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
1:11	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
glorious	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
God,	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
my	1
trust.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
thank	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
enabled	1
me,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
counted	1
me	1
faithful,	1
putting	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
ministry;	1
1:13	1
Who	1
was	1
before	1
a	1
blasphemer,	1
and	1
a	1
persecutor,	1
and	1
injurious:	1
but	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
it	1
ignorantly	1
in	1
unbelief.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
exceeding	1
abundant	1
with	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation,	1
that	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
save	1
sinners;	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
chief.	1
	1
1:16	1
Howbeit	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
first	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
might	1
shew	1
forth	1
all	1
longsuffering,	1
for	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
should	1
hereafter	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
unto	1
the	1
King	1
eternal,	1
immortal,	1
invisible,	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God,	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:18	1
This	1
charge	1
I	1
commit	1
unto	1
thee,	1
son	1
Timothy,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
prophecies	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
on	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
by	1
them	1
mightest	1
war	1
a	1
good	1
warfare;	1
1:19	1
Holding	1
faith,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
which	1
some	1
having	1
put	1
away	1
concerning	1
faith	1
have	1
made	1
shipwreck:	1
1:20	1
Of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Alexander;	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
delivered	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
not	1
to	1
blaspheme.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
exhort	1
therefore,	1
that,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
supplications,	1
prayers,	1
intercessions,	1
and	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
all	1
men;	1
2:2	1
For	1
kings,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
authority;	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
lead	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
peaceable	1
life	1
in	1
all	1
godliness	1
and	1
honesty.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
2:4	1
Who	1
will	1
have	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
and	1
one	1
mediator	1
between	1
God	1
and	1
men,	1
the	1
man	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
all,	1
to	1
be	1
testified	1
in	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
2:7	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
ordained	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
(I	1
speak	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
lie	1
not;)	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
verity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
men	1
pray	1
every	1
where,	1
lifting	1
up	1
holy	1
hands,	1
without	1
wrath	1
and	1
doubting.	1
	1
2:9	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
also,	1
that	1
women	1
adorn	1
themselves	1
in	1
modest	1
apparel,	1
with	1
shamefacedness	1
and	1
sobriety;	1
not	1
with	1
broided	1
hair,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
pearls,	1
or	1
costly	1
array;	1
2:10	1
But	1
(which	1
becometh	1
women	1
professing	1
godliness)	1
with	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:11	1
Let	1
the	1
woman	1
learn	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
all	1
subjection.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
I	1
suffer	1
not	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
teach,	1
nor	1
to	1
usurp	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
man,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
Adam	1
was	1
first	1
formed,	1
then	1
Eve.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
Adam	1
was	1
not	1
deceived,	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
being	1
deceived	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
transgression.	1
	1
2:15	1
Notwithstanding	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
childbearing,	1
if	1
they	1
continue	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
charity	1
and	1
holiness	1
with	1
sobriety.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
saying,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
desire	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
bishop,	1
he	1
desireth	1
a	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
3:2	1
A	1
bishop	1
then	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
vigilant,	1
sober,	1
of	1
good	1
behaviour,	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach;	1
3:3	1
Not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
but	1
patient,	1
not	1
a	1
brawler,	1
not	1
covetous;	1
3:4	1
One	1
that	1
ruleth	1
well	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
having	1
his	1
children	1
in	1
subjection	1
with	1
all	1
gravity;	1
3:5	1
(For	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
rule	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God?)	1
	1
3:6	1
Not	1
a	1
novice,	1
lest	1
being	1
lifted	1
up	1
with	1
pride	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:7	1
Moreover	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
without;	1
lest	1
he	1
fall	1
into	1
reproach	1
and	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:8	1
Likewise	1
must	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
doubletongued,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
not	1
greedy	1
of	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
3:9	1
Holding	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
a	1
pure	1
conscience.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
let	1
these	1
also	1
first	1
be	1
proved;	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
use	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon,	1
being	1
found	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:11	1
Even	1
so	1
must	1
their	1
wives	1
be	1
grave,	1
not	1
slanderers,	1
sober,	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
deacons	1
be	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
ruling	1
their	1
children	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
well.	1
	1
3:13	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
a	1
deacon	1
well	1
purchase	1
to	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
degree,	1
and	1
great	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:14	1
These	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
thee,	1
hoping	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
shortly:	1
3:15	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
tarry	1
long,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
know	1
how	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
behave	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
pillar	1
and	1
ground	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
without	1
controversy	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
godliness:	1
God	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
seen	1
of	1
angels,	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
believed	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
glory.	1
	1
4:1	1
Now	1
the	1
Spirit	1
speaketh	1
expressly,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
times	1
some	1
shall	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
seducing	1
spirits,	1
and	1
doctrines	1
of	1
devils;	1
4:2	1
Speaking	1
lies	1
in	1
hypocrisy;	1
having	1
their	1
conscience	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
hot	1
iron;	1
4:3	1
Forbidding	1
to	1
marry,	1
and	1
commanding	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
created	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
believe	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
every	1
creature	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
refused,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
received	1
with	1
thanksgiving:	1
4:5	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:6	1
If	1
thou	1
put	1
the	1
brethren	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
doctrine,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
hast	1
attained.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
refuse	1
profane	1
and	1
old	1
wives'	1
fables,	1
and	1
exercise	1
thyself	1
rather	1
unto	1
godliness.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
bodily	1
exercise	1
profiteth	1
little:	1
but	1
godliness	1
is	1
profitable	1
unto	1
all	1
things,	1
having	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
now	1
is,	1
and	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
acceptation.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
therefore	1
we	1
both	1
labour	1
and	1
suffer	1
reproach,	1
because	1
we	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
specially	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
4:11	1
These	1
things	1
command	1
and	1
teach.	1
	1
4:12	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thy	1
youth;	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
believers,	1
in	1
word,	1
in	1
conversation,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
spirit,	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
purity.	1
	1
4:13	1
Till	1
I	1
come,	1
give	1
attendance	1
to	1
reading,	1
to	1
exhortation,	1
to	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:14	1
Neglect	1
not	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
thee	1
by	1
prophecy,	1
with	1
the	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
presbytery.	1
	1
4:15	1
Meditate	1
upon	1
these	1
things;	1
give	1
thyself	1
wholly	1
to	1
them;	1
that	1
thy	1
profiting	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
Take	1
heed	1
unto	1
thyself,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
doctrine;	1
continue	1
in	1
them:	1
for	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
thou	1
shalt	1
both	1
save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
hear	1
thee.	1
	1
5:1	1
Rebuke	1
not	1
an	1
elder,	1
but	1
intreat	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
father;	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
men	1
as	1
brethren;	1
5:2	1
The	1
elder	1
women	1
as	1
mothers;	1
the	1
younger	1
as	1
sisters,	1
with	1
all	1
purity.	1
	1
5:3	1
Honour	1
widows	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:4	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
widow	1
have	1
children	1
or	1
nephews,	1
let	1
them	1
learn	1
first	1
to	1
shew	1
piety	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
to	1
requite	1
their	1
parents:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
acceptable	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
Now	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
widow	1
indeed,	1
and	1
desolate,	1
trusteth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
continueth	1
in	1
supplications	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
she	1
that	1
liveth	1
in	1
pleasure	1
is	1
dead	1
while	1
she	1
liveth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
give	1
in	1
charge,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
blameless.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
provide	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
specially	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
he	1
hath	1
denied	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
an	1
infidel.	1
	1
5:9	1
Let	1
not	1
a	1
widow	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
number	1
under	1
threescore	1
years	1
old,	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
man.	1
	1
5:10	1
Well	1
reported	1
of	1
for	1
good	1
works;	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
brought	1
up	1
children,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
lodged	1
strangers,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
washed	1
the	1
saints'	1
feet,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
relieved	1
the	1
afflicted,	1
if	1
she	1
have	1
diligently	1
followed	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
the	1
younger	1
widows	1
refuse:	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
wax	1
wanton	1
against	1
Christ,	1
they	1
will	1
marry;	1
5:12	1
Having	1
damnation,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
first	1
faith.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
withal	1
they	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
wandering	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
idle,	1
but	1
tattlers	1
also	1
and	1
busybodies,	1
speaking	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not.	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
younger	1
women	1
marry,	1
bear	1
children,	1
guide	1
the	1
house,	1
give	1
none	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
adversary	1
to	1
speak	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
5:15	1
For	1
some	1
are	1
already	1
turned	1
aside	1
after	1
Satan.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
that	1
believeth	1
have	1
widows,	1
let	1
them	1
relieve	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
church	1
be	1
charged;	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
relieve	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
widows	1
indeed.	1
	1
5:17	1
Let	1
the	1
elders	1
that	1
rule	1
well	1
be	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
double	1
honour,	1
especially	1
they	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
And,	1
The	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
5:19	1
Against	1
an	1
elder	1
receive	1
not	1
an	1
accusation,	1
but	1
before	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses.	1
	1
5:20	1
Them	1
that	1
sin	1
rebuke	1
before	1
all,	1
that	1
others	1
also	1
may	1
fear.	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
elect	1
angels,	1
that	1
thou	1
observe	1
these	1
things	1
without	1
preferring	1
one	1
before	1
another,	1
doing	1
nothing	1
by	1
partiality.	1
	1
5:22	1
Lay	1
hands	1
suddenly	1
on	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
other	1
men's	1
sins:	1
keep	1
thyself	1
pure.	1
	1
5:23	1
Drink	1
no	1
longer	1
water,	1
but	1
use	1
a	1
little	1
wine	1
for	1
thy	1
stomach's	1
sake	1
and	1
thine	1
often	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:24	1
Some	1
men's	1
sins	1
are	1
open	1
beforehand,	1
going	1
before	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
some	1
men	1
they	1
follow	1
after.	1
	1
5:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
good	1
works	1
of	1
some	1
are	1
manifest	1
beforehand;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
otherwise	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
6:1	1
Let	1
as	1
many	1
servants	1
as	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
yoke	1
count	1
their	1
own	1
masters	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
honour,	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
doctrine	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
believing	1
masters,	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
despise	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
brethren;	1
but	1
rather	1
do	1
them	1
service,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
beloved,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
benefit.	1
These	1
things	1
teach	1
and	1
exhort.	1
	1
6:3	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
consent	1
not	1
to	1
wholesome	1
words,	1
even	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
godliness;	1
6:4	1
He	1
is	1
proud,	1
knowing	1
nothing,	1
but	1
doting	1
about	1
questions	1
and	1
strifes	1
of	1
words,	1
whereof	1
cometh	1
envy,	1
strife,	1
railings,	1
evil	1
surmisings,	1
6:5	1
Perverse	1
disputings	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
supposing	1
that	1
gain	1
is	1
godliness:	1
from	1
such	1
withdraw	1
thyself.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
godliness	1
with	1
contentment	1
is	1
great	1
gain.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
we	1
brought	1
nothing	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
we	1
can	1
carry	1
nothing	1
out.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
having	1
food	1
and	1
raiment	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
therewith	1
content.	1
	1
6:9	1
But	1
they	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
rich	1
fall	1
into	1
temptation	1
and	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
into	1
many	1
foolish	1
and	1
hurtful	1
lusts,	1
which	1
drown	1
men	1
in	1
destruction	1
and	1
perdition.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
money	1
is	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
evil:	1
which	1
while	1
some	1
coveted	1
after,	1
they	1
have	1
erred	1
from	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
pierced	1
themselves	1
through	1
with	1
many	1
sorrows.	1
	1
6:11	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
man	1
of	1
God,	1
flee	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
follow	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
godliness,	1
faith,	1
love,	1
patience,	1
meekness.	1
	1
6:12	1
Fight	1
the	1
good	1
fight	1
of	1
faith,	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life,	1
whereunto	1
thou	1
art	1
also	1
called,	1
and	1
hast	1
professed	1
a	1
good	1
profession	1
before	1
many	1
witnesses.	1
	1
6:13	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
before	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
before	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
witnessed	1
a	1
good	1
confession;	1
6:14	1
That	1
thou	1
keep	1
this	1
commandment	1
without	1
spot,	1
unrebukable,	1
until	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
6:15	1
Which	1
in	1
his	1
times	1
he	1
shall	1
shew,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
blessed	1
and	1
only	1
Potentate,	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords;	1
6:16	1
Who	1
only	1
hath	1
immortality,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
approach	1
unto;	1
whom	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
seen,	1
nor	1
can	1
see:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
honour	1
and	1
power	1
everlasting.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:17	1
Charge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
rich	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
nor	1
trust	1
in	1
uncertain	1
riches,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
who	1
giveth	1
us	1
richly	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
enjoy;	1
6:18	1
That	1
they	1
do	1
good,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
rich	1
in	1
good	1
works,	1
ready	1
to	1
distribute,	1
willing	1
to	1
communicate;	1
6:19	1
Laying	1
up	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
themselves	1
a	1
good	1
foundation	1
against	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:20	1
O	1
Timothy,	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
to	1
thy	1
trust,	1
avoiding	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings,	1
and	1
oppositions	1
of	1
science	1
falsely	1
so	1
called:	1
6:21	1
Which	1
some	1
professing	1
have	1
erred	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Timothy	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
1:2	1
To	1
Timothy,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
son:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
thank	1
God,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
from	1
my	1
forefathers	1
with	1
pure	1
conscience,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
have	1
remembrance	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
my	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day;	1
1:4	1
Greatly	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
being	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
tears,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
joy;	1
1:5	1
When	1
I	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
unfeigned	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
which	1
dwelt	1
first	1
in	1
thy	1
grandmother	1
Lois,	1
and	1
thy	1
mother	1
Eunice;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
in	1
thee	1
also.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
put	1
thee	1
in	1
remembrance	1
that	1
thou	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
fear;	1
but	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
mind.	1
	1
1:8	1
Be	1
not	1
thou	1
therefore	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
of	1
me	1
his	1
prisoner:	1
but	1
be	1
thou	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
afflictions	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God;	1
1:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
saved	1
us,	1
and	1
called	1
us	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
calling,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
works,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
purpose	1
and	1
grace,	1
which	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
1:10	1
But	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
manifest	1
by	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
hath	1
abolished	1
death,	1
and	1
hath	1
brought	1
life	1
and	1
immortality	1
to	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:11	1
Whereunto	1
I	1
am	1
appointed	1
a	1
preacher,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
which	1
cause	1
I	1
also	1
suffer	1
these	1
things:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
believed,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
unto	1
him	1
against	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
1:13	1
Hold	1
fast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
sound	1
words,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
faith	1
and	1
love	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:14	1
That	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
was	1
committed	1
unto	1
thee	1
keep	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:15	1
This	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
Phygellus	1
and	1
Hermogenes.	1
	1
1:16	1
The	1
Lord	1
give	1
mercy	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Onesiphorus;	1
for	1
he	1
oft	1
refreshed	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
my	1
chain:	1
1:17	1
But,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Rome,	1
he	1
sought	1
me	1
out	1
very	1
diligently,	1
and	1
found	1
me.	1
	1
1:18	1
The	1
Lord	1
grant	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
in	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
very	1
well.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thou	1
therefore,	1
my	1
son,	1
be	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
of	1
me	1
among	1
many	1
witnesses,	1
the	1
same	1
commit	1
thou	1
to	1
faithful	1
men,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
teach	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
2:3	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
endure	1
hardness,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:4	1
No	1
man	1
that	1
warreth	1
entangleth	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
life;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
chosen	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
soldier.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
also	1
strive	1
for	1
masteries,	1
yet	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
crowned,	1
except	1
he	1
strive	1
lawfully.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
husbandman	1
that	1
laboureth	1
must	1
be	1
first	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
fruits.	1
	1
2:7	1
Consider	1
what	1
I	1
say;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
give	1
thee	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:8	1
Remember	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
was	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel:	1
2:9	1
Wherein	1
I	1
suffer	1
trouble,	1
as	1
an	1
evil	1
doer,	1
even	1
unto	1
bonds;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
bound.	1
	1
2:10	1
Therefore	1
I	1
endure	1
all	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sakes,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
also	1
obtain	1
the	1
salvation	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
with	1
eternal	1
glory.	1
	1
2:11	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying:	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
him,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
2:12	1
If	1
we	1
suffer,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
reign	1
with	1
him:	1
if	1
we	1
deny	1
him,	1
he	1
also	1
will	1
deny	1
us:	1
2:13	1
If	1
we	1
believe	1
not,	1
yet	1
he	1
abideth	1
faithful:	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
himself.	1
	1
2:14	1
Of	1
these	1
things	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
charging	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
they	1
strive	1
not	1
about	1
words	1
to	1
no	1
profit,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
subverting	1
of	1
the	1
hearers.	1
	1
2:15	1
Study	1
to	1
shew	1
thyself	1
approved	1
unto	1
God,	1
a	1
workman	1
that	1
needeth	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
rightly	1
dividing	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
shun	1
profane	1
and	1
vain	1
babblings:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
increase	1
unto	1
more	1
ungodliness.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
their	1
word	1
will	1
eat	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
canker:	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
Hymenaeus	1
and	1
Philetus;	1
2:18	1
Who	1
concerning	1
the	1
truth	1
have	1
erred,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
resurrection	1
is	1
past	1
already;	1
and	1
overthrow	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
some.	1
	1
2:19	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
God	1
standeth	1
sure,	1
having	1
this	1
seal,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
his.	1
And,	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
nameth	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ	1
depart	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
house	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
vessels	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
of	1
earth;	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
honour,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
dishonour.	1
	1
2:21	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
therefore	1
purge	1
himself	1
from	1
these,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
meet	1
for	1
the	1
master's	1
use,	1
and	1
prepared	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work.	1
	1
2:22	1
Flee	1
also	1
youthful	1
lusts:	1
but	1
follow	1
righteousness,	1
faith,	1
charity,	1
peace,	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pure	1
heart.	1
	1
2:23	1
But	1
foolish	1
and	1
unlearned	1
questions	1
avoid,	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
gender	1
strifes.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
must	1
not	1
strive;	1
but	1
be	1
gentle	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
apt	1
to	1
teach,	1
patient,	1
2:25	1
In	1
meekness	1
instructing	1
those	1
that	1
oppose	1
themselves;	1
if	1
God	1
peradventure	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
repentance	1
to	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
2:26	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
recover	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
snare	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
are	1
taken	1
captive	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
know	1
also,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
perilous	1
times	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
lovers	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
selves,	1
covetous,	1
boasters,	1
proud,	1
blasphemers,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
unthankful,	1
unholy,	1
3:3	1
Without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
trucebreakers,	1
false	1
accusers,	1
incontinent,	1
fierce,	1
despisers	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
good,	1
3:4	1
Traitors,	1
heady,	1
highminded,	1
lovers	1
of	1
pleasures	1
more	1
than	1
lovers	1
of	1
God;	1
3:5	1
Having	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
godliness,	1
but	1
denying	1
the	1
power	1
thereof:	1
from	1
such	1
turn	1
away.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
creep	1
into	1
houses,	1
and	1
lead	1
captive	1
silly	1
women	1
laden	1
with	1
sins,	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
divers	1
lusts,	1
3:7	1
Ever	1
learning,	1
and	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
as	1
Jannes	1
and	1
Jambres	1
withstood	1
Moses,	1
so	1
do	1
these	1
also	1
resist	1
the	1
truth:	1
men	1
of	1
corrupt	1
minds,	1
reprobate	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
proceed	1
no	1
further:	1
for	1
their	1
folly	1
shall	1
be	1
manifest	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
their's	1
also	1
was.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
thou	1
hast	1
fully	1
known	1
my	1
doctrine,	1
manner	1
of	1
life,	1
purpose,	1
faith,	1
longsuffering,	1
charity,	1
patience,	1
3:11	1
Persecutions,	1
afflictions,	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
Antioch,	1
at	1
Iconium,	1
at	1
Lystra;	1
what	1
persecutions	1
I	1
endured:	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
Lord	1
delivered	1
me.	1
	1
3:12	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
live	1
godly	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
shall	1
suffer	1
persecution.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
evil	1
men	1
and	1
seducers	1
shall	1
wax	1
worse	1
and	1
worse,	1
deceiving,	1
and	1
being	1
deceived.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
continue	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
and	1
hast	1
been	1
assured	1
of,	1
knowing	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
learned	1
them;	1
3:15	1
And	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
thou	1
hast	1
known	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,	1
which	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
wise	1
unto	1
salvation	1
through	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:16	1
All	1
scripture	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
inspiration	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
doctrine,	1
for	1
reproof,	1
for	1
correction,	1
for	1
instruction	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
3:17	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
perfect,	1
throughly	1
furnished	1
unto	1
all	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
4:1	1
I	1
charge	1
thee	1
therefore	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
who	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
at	1
his	1
appearing	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom;	1
4:2	1
Preach	1
the	1
word;	1
be	1
instant	1
in	1
season,	1
out	1
of	1
season;	1
reprove,	1
rebuke,	1
exhort	1
with	1
all	1
longsuffering	1
and	1
doctrine.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
endure	1
sound	1
doctrine;	1
but	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts	1
shall	1
they	1
heap	1
to	1
themselves	1
teachers,	1
having	1
itching	1
ears;	1
4:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
fables.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
watch	1
thou	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
endure	1
afflictions,	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
evangelist,	1
make	1
full	1
proof	1
of	1
thy	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
offered,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:7	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
a	1
good	1
fight,	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
my	1
course,	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
the	1
faith:	1
4:8	1
Henceforth	1
there	1
is	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord,	1
the	1
righteous	1
judge,	1
shall	1
give	1
me	1
at	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
me	1
only,	1
but	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
love	1
his	1
appearing.	1
	1
4:9	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
shortly	1
unto	1
me:	1
4:10	1
For	1
Demas	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
me,	1
having	1
loved	1
this	1
present	1
world,	1
and	1
is	1
departed	1
unto	1
Thessalonica;	1
Crescens	1
to	1
Galatia,	1
Titus	1
unto	1
Dalmatia.	1
	1
4:11	1
Only	1
Luke	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
Take	1
Mark,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
with	1
thee:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
profitable	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Tychicus	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
4:13	1
The	1
cloke	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Troas	1
with	1
Carpus,	1
when	1
thou	1
comest,	1
bring	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
books,	1
but	1
especially	1
the	1
parchments.	1
	1
4:14	1
Alexander	1
the	1
coppersmith	1
did	1
me	1
much	1
evil:	1
the	1
Lord	1
reward	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works:	1
4:15	1
Of	1
whom	1
be	1
thou	1
ware	1
also;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
greatly	1
withstood	1
our	1
words.	1
	1
4:16	1
At	1
my	1
first	1
answer	1
no	1
man	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
men	1
forsook	1
me:	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
	1
4:17	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
strengthened	1
me;	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
the	1
preaching	1
might	1
be	1
fully	1
known,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
hear:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
every	1
evil	1
work,	1
and	1
will	1
preserve	1
me	1
unto	1
his	1
heavenly	1
kingdom:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:19	1
Salute	1
Prisca	1
and	1
Aquila,	1
and	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Onesiphorus.	1
	1
4:20	1
Erastus	1
abode	1
at	1
Corinth:	1
but	1
Trophimus	1
have	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
Miletum	1
sick.	1
	1
4:21	1
Do	1
thy	1
diligence	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
winter.	1
Eubulus	1
greeteth	1
thee,	1
and	1
Pudens,	1
and	1
Linus,	1
and	1
Claudia,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
4:22	1
The	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
thy	1
spirit.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
Titus	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God's	1
elect,	1
and	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
which	1
is	1
after	1
godliness;	1
1:2	1
In	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
God,	1
that	1
cannot	1
lie,	1
promised	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
began;	1
1:3	1
But	1
hath	1
in	1
due	1
times	1
manifested	1
his	1
word	1
through	1
preaching,	1
which	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
1:4	1
To	1
Titus,	1
mine	1
own	1
son	1
after	1
the	1
common	1
faith:	1
Grace,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
left	1
I	1
thee	1
in	1
Crete,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
wanting,	1
and	1
ordain	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
appointed	1
thee:	1
1:6	1
If	1
any	1
be	1
blameless,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
one	1
wife,	1
having	1
faithful	1
children	1
not	1
accused	1
of	1
riot	1
or	1
unruly.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
a	1
bishop	1
must	1
be	1
blameless,	1
as	1
the	1
steward	1
of	1
God;	1
not	1
selfwilled,	1
not	1
soon	1
angry,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
wine,	1
no	1
striker,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
filthy	1
lucre;	1
1:8	1
But	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
hospitality,	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
good	1
men,	1
sober,	1
just,	1
holy,	1
temperate;	1
1:9	1
Holding	1
fast	1
the	1
faithful	1
word	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
taught,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
by	1
sound	1
doctrine	1
both	1
to	1
exhort	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
gainsayers.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
unruly	1
and	1
vain	1
talkers	1
and	1
deceivers,	1
specially	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision:	1
1:11	1
Whose	1
mouths	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
who	1
subvert	1
whole	1
houses,	1
teaching	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
ought	1
not,	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre's	1
sake.	1
	1
1:12	1
One	1
of	1
themselves,	1
even	1
a	1
prophet	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
said,	1
The	1
Cretians	1
are	1
alway	1
liars,	1
evil	1
beasts,	1
slow	1
bellies.	1
	1
1:13	1
This	1
witness	1
is	1
true.	1
Wherefore	1
rebuke	1
them	1
sharply,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
faith;	1
1:14	1
Not	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
Jewish	1
fables,	1
and	1
commandments	1
of	1
men,	1
that	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
Unto	1
the	1
pure	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
pure:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
defiled	1
and	1
unbelieving	1
is	1
nothing	1
pure;	1
but	1
even	1
their	1
mind	1
and	1
conscience	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
1:16	1
They	1
profess	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
God;	1
but	1
in	1
works	1
they	1
deny	1
him,	1
being	1
abominable,	1
and	1
disobedient,	1
and	1
unto	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
reprobate.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
speak	1
thou	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
become	1
sound	1
doctrine:	1
2:2	1
That	1
the	1
aged	1
men	1
be	1
sober,	1
grave,	1
temperate,	1
sound	1
in	1
faith,	1
in	1
charity,	1
in	1
patience.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
aged	1
women	1
likewise,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
in	1
behaviour	1
as	1
becometh	1
holiness,	1
not	1
false	1
accusers,	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
much	1
wine,	1
teachers	1
of	1
good	1
things;	1
2:4	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
teach	1
the	1
young	1
women	1
to	1
be	1
sober,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
husbands,	1
to	1
love	1
their	1
children,	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
discreet,	1
chaste,	1
keepers	1
at	1
home,	1
good,	1
obedient	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
husbands,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
not	1
blasphemed.	1
	1
2:6	1
Young	1
men	1
likewise	1
exhort	1
to	1
be	1
sober	1
minded.	1
	1
2:7	1
In	1
all	1
things	1
shewing	1
thyself	1
a	1
pattern	1
of	1
good	1
works:	1
in	1
doctrine	1
shewing	1
uncorruptness,	1
gravity,	1
sincerity,	1
2:8	1
Sound	1
speech,	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
condemned;	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
part	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
having	1
no	1
evil	1
thing	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
2:9	1
Exhort	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
obedient	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
masters,	1
and	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
well	1
in	1
all	1
things;	1
not	1
answering	1
again;	1
2:10	1
Not	1
purloining,	1
but	1
shewing	1
all	1
good	1
fidelity;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
adorn	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
bringeth	1
salvation	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
2:12	1
Teaching	1
us	1
that,	1
denying	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
worldly	1
lusts,	1
we	1
should	1
live	1
soberly,	1
righteously,	1
and	1
godly,	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
world;	1
2:13	1
Looking	1
for	1
that	1
blessed	1
hope,	1
and	1
the	1
glorious	1
appearing	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
2:14	1
Who	1
gave	1
himself	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
redeem	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
purify	1
unto	1
himself	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people,	1
zealous	1
of	1
good	1
works.	1
	1
2:15	1
These	1
things	1
speak,	1
and	1
exhort,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
with	1
all	1
authority.	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
despise	1
thee.	1
	1
3:1	1
Put	1
them	1
in	1
mind	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
principalities	1
and	1
powers,	1
to	1
obey	1
magistrates,	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
every	1
good	1
work,	1
3:2	1
To	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
brawlers,	1
but	1
gentle,	1
shewing	1
all	1
meekness	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
we	1
ourselves	1
also	1
were	1
sometimes	1
foolish,	1
disobedient,	1
deceived,	1
serving	1
divers	1
lusts	1
and	1
pleasures,	1
living	1
in	1
malice	1
and	1
envy,	1
hateful,	1
and	1
hating	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:4	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour	1
toward	1
man	1
appeared,	1
3:5	1
Not	1
by	1
works	1
of	1
righteousness	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
done,	1
but	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
mercy	1
he	1
saved	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
regeneration,	1
and	1
renewing	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost;	1
3:6	1
Which	1
he	1
shed	1
on	1
us	1
abundantly	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Saviour;	1
3:7	1
That	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
grace,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
heirs	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:8	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
saying,	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
affirm	1
constantly,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works.	1
These	1
things	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
profitable	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
3:9	1
But	1
avoid	1
foolish	1
questions,	1
and	1
genealogies,	1
and	1
contentions,	1
and	1
strivings	1
about	1
the	1
law;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
and	1
vain.	1
	1
3:10	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
heretick	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
admonition	1
reject;	1
3:11	1
Knowing	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
such	1
is	1
subverted,	1
and	1
sinneth,	1
being	1
condemned	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
3:12	1
When	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
Artemas	1
unto	1
thee,	1
or	1
Tychicus,	1
be	1
diligent	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me	1
to	1
Nicopolis:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
there	1
to	1
winter.	1
	1
3:13	1
Bring	1
Zenas	1
the	1
lawyer	1
and	1
Apollos	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
diligently,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
wanting	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
let	1
our's	1
also	1
learn	1
to	1
maintain	1
good	1
works	1
for	1
necessary	1
uses,	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
3:15	1
All	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
faith.	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1

	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Timothy	1
our	1
brother,	1
unto	1
Philemon	1
our	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
and	1
fellowlabourer,	1
1:2	1
And	1
to	1
our	1
beloved	1
Apphia,	1
and	1
Archippus	1
our	1
fellowsoldier,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
thy	1
house:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
making	1
mention	1
of	1
thee	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers,	1
1:5	1
Hearing	1
of	1
thy	1
love	1
and	1
faith,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
toward	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
toward	1
all	1
saints;	1
1:6	1
That	1
the	1
communication	1
of	1
thy	1
faith	1
may	1
become	1
effectual	1
by	1
the	1
acknowledging	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
great	1
joy	1
and	1
consolation	1
in	1
thy	1
love,	1
because	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
are	1
refreshed	1
by	1
thee,	1
brother.	1
	1
1:8	1
Wherefore,	1
though	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
much	1
bold	1
in	1
Christ	1
to	1
enjoin	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
convenient,	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
for	1
love's	1
sake	1
I	1
rather	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
being	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
Paul	1
the	1
aged,	1
and	1
now	1
also	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
for	1
my	1
son	1
Onesimus,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
in	1
my	1
bonds:	1
1:11	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
was	1
to	1
thee	1
unprofitable,	1
but	1
now	1
profitable	1
to	1
thee	1
and	1
to	1
me:	1
1:12	1
Whom	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
again:	1
thou	1
therefore	1
receive	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
mine	1
own	1
bowels:	1
1:13	1
Whom	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
retained	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
in	1
thy	1
stead	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
bonds	1
of	1
the	1
gospel:	1
1:14	1
But	1
without	1
thy	1
mind	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
nothing;	1
that	1
thy	1
benefit	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
necessity,	1
but	1
willingly.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
perhaps	1
he	1
therefore	1
departed	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
receive	1
him	1
for	1
ever;	1
1:16	1
Not	1
now	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
but	1
above	1
a	1
servant,	1
a	1
brother	1
beloved,	1
specially	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
unto	1
thee,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
1:17	1
If	1
thou	1
count	1
me	1
therefore	1
a	1
partner,	1
receive	1
him	1
as	1
myself.	1
	1
1:18	1
If	1
he	1
hath	1
wronged	1
thee,	1
or	1
oweth	1
thee	1
ought,	1
put	1
that	1
on	1
mine	1
account;	1
1:19	1
I	1
Paul	1
have	1
written	1
it	1
with	1
mine	1
own	1
hand,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
it:	1
albeit	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
to	1
thee	1
how	1
thou	1
owest	1
unto	1
me	1
even	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
besides.	1
	1
1:20	1
Yea,	1
brother,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
joy	1
of	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
Lord:	1
refresh	1
my	1
bowels	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:21	1
Having	1
confidence	1
in	1
thy	1
obedience	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
thee,	1
knowing	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
also	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
withal	1
prepare	1
me	1
also	1
a	1
lodging:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
prayers	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:23	1
There	1
salute	1
thee	1
Epaphras,	1
my	1
fellowprisoner	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
1:24	1
Marcus,	1
Aristarchus,	1
Demas,	1
Lucas,	1
my	1
fellowlabourers.	1
	1
1:25	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
spirit.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Hebrews	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
God,	1
who	1
at	1
sundry	1
times	1
and	1
in	1
divers	1
manners	1
spake	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
1:2	1
Hath	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
days	1
spoken	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Son,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
heir	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
by	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
worlds;	1
1:3	1
Who	1
being	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
express	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
person,	1
and	1
upholding	1
all	1
things	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
himself	1
purged	1
our	1
sins,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
on	1
high:	1
1:4	1
Being	1
made	1
so	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
by	1
inheritance	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
name	1
than	1
they.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
unto	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee?	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
Son?	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
again,	1
when	1
he	1
bringeth	1
in	1
the	1
firstbegotten	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
And	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
he	1
saith,	1
Who	1
maketh	1
his	1
angels	1
spirits,	1
and	1
his	1
ministers	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
he	1
saith,	1
Thy	1
throne,	1
O	1
God,	1
is	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
a	1
sceptre	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
hated	1
iniquity;	1
therefore	1
God,	1
even	1
thy	1
God,	1
hath	1
anointed	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
of	1
gladness	1
above	1
thy	1
fellows.	1
	1
1:10	1
And,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
hast	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
are	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thine	1
hands:	1
1:11	1
They	1
shall	1
perish;	1
but	1
thou	1
remainest;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
shall	1
wax	1
old	1
as	1
doth	1
a	1
garment;	1
1:12	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
vesture	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fold	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
changed:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
thy	1
years	1
shall	1
not	1
fail.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
Sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
until	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
1:14	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
ministering	1
spirits,	1
sent	1
forth	1
to	1
minister	1
for	1
them	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
heirs	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
more	1
earnest	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
we	1
should	1
let	1
them	1
slip.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
spoken	1
by	1
angels	1
was	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
every	1
transgression	1
and	1
disobedience	1
received	1
a	1
just	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward;	1
2:3	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
neglect	1
so	1
great	1
salvation;	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
was	1
confirmed	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
him;	1
2:4	1
God	1
also	1
bearing	1
them	1
witness,	1
both	1
with	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
and	1
with	1
divers	1
miracles,	1
and	1
gifts	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will?	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
unto	1
the	1
angels	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
put	1
in	1
subjection	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
whereof	1
we	1
speak.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
one	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
testified,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
man,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
mindful	1
of	1
him?	1
or	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
visitest	1
him?	1
2:7	1
Thou	1
madest	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels;	1
thou	1
crownedst	1
him	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
didst	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
thy	1
hands:	1
2:8	1
Thou	1
hast	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
all	1
in	1
subjection	1
under	1
him,	1
he	1
left	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
not	1
yet	1
all	1
things	1
put	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
we	1
see	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels	1
for	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
death,	1
crowned	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour;	1
that	1
he	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
taste	1
death	1
for	1
every	1
man.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
it	1
became	1
him,	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
in	1
bringing	1
many	1
sons	1
unto	1
glory,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
their	1
salvation	1
perfect	1
through	1
sufferings.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
sanctified	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
one:	1
for	1
which	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
brethren,	1
2:12	1
Saying,	1
I	1
will	1
declare	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
my	1
brethren,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
praise	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
And	1
again,	1
Behold	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
me.	1
	1
2:14	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
the	1
children	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
he	1
also	1
himself	1
likewise	1
took	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same;	1
that	1
through	1
death	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
death,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
devil;	1
2:15	1
And	1
deliver	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
were	1
all	1
their	1
lifetime	1
subject	1
to	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
verily	1
he	1
took	1
not	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
angels;	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
on	1
him	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
2:17	1
Wherefore	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
it	1
behoved	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
his	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
merciful	1
and	1
faithful	1
high	1
priest	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
suffered	1
being	1
tempted,	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
tempted.	1
	1
3:1	1
Wherefore,	1
holy	1
brethren,	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
calling,	1
consider	1
the	1
Apostle	1
and	1
High	1
Priest	1
of	1
our	1
profession,	1
Christ	1
Jesus;	1
3:2	1
Who	1
was	1
faithful	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
appointed	1
him,	1
as	1
also	1
Moses	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
counted	1
worthy	1
of	1
more	1
glory	1
than	1
Moses,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
hath	1
builded	1
the	1
house	1
hath	1
more	1
honour	1
than	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
every	1
house	1
is	1
builded	1
by	1
some	1
man;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
built	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
Moses	1
verily	1
was	1
faithful	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
as	1
a	1
servant,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
spoken	1
after;	1
3:6	1
But	1
Christ	1
as	1
a	1
son	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
whose	1
house	1
are	1
we,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
firm	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
3:7	1
Wherefore	1
(as	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
saith,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
3:8	1
Harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
temptation	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
3:9	1
When	1
your	1
fathers	1
tempted	1
me,	1
proved	1
me,	1
and	1
saw	1
my	1
works	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
3:10	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
was	1
grieved	1
with	1
that	1
generation,	1
and	1
said,	1
They	1
do	1
alway	1
err	1
in	1
their	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
my	1
ways.	1
	1
3:11	1
So	1
I	1
sware	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.)	1
	1
3:12	1
Take	1
heed,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
an	1
evil	1
heart	1
of	1
unbelief,	1
in	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
3:13	1
But	1
exhort	1
one	1
another	1
daily,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
To	1
day;	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
hardened	1
through	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:14	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
if	1
we	1
hold	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
confidence	1
stedfast	1
unto	1
the	1
end;	1
3:15	1
While	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
provocation.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
some,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard,	1
did	1
provoke:	1
howbeit	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
by	1
Moses.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
with	1
whom	1
was	1
he	1
grieved	1
forty	1
years?	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
sinned,	1
whose	1
carcases	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
to	1
whom	1
sware	1
he	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not?	1
	1
3:19	1
So	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
fear,	1
lest,	1
a	1
promise	1
being	1
left	1
us	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
seem	1
to	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
unto	1
us	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
preached	1
did	1
not	1
profit	1
them,	1
not	1
being	1
mixed	1
with	1
faith	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
we	1
which	1
have	1
believed	1
do	1
enter	1
into	1
rest,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
in	1
my	1
wrath,	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest:	1
although	1
the	1
works	1
were	1
finished	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
And	1
God	1
did	1
rest	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
again,	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
rest.	1
	1
4:6	1
Seeing	1
therefore	1
it	1
remaineth	1
that	1
some	1
must	1
enter	1
therein,	1
and	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
first	1
preached	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief:	1
4:7	1
Again,	1
he	1
limiteth	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
saying	1
in	1
David,	1
To	1
day,	1
after	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
To	1
day	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
harden	1
not	1
your	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:8	1
For	1
if	1
Jesus	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
rest,	1
then	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
afterward	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
another	1
day.	1
	1
4:9	1
There	1
remaineth	1
therefore	1
a	1
rest	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
rest,	1
he	1
also	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
works,	1
as	1
God	1
did	1
from	1
his.	1
	1
4:11	1
Let	1
us	1
labour	1
therefore	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
that	1
rest,	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fall	1
after	1
the	1
same	1
example	1
of	1
unbelief.	1
	1
4:12	1
For	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
quick,	1
and	1
powerful,	1
and	1
sharper	1
than	1
any	1
twoedged	1
sword,	1
piercing	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
dividing	1
asunder	1
of	1
soul	1
and	1
spirit,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
joints	1
and	1
marrow,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
discerner	1
of	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
intents	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:13	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
creature	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
manifest	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
naked	1
and	1
opened	1
unto	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
4:14	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
high	1
priest,	1
that	1
is	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
heavens,	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
our	1
profession.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
our	1
infirmities;	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
tempted	1
like	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
yet	1
without	1
sin.	1
	1
4:16	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
come	1
boldly	1
unto	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
grace,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy,	1
and	1
find	1
grace	1
to	1
help	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
need.	1
	1
5:1	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
ordained	1
for	1
men	1
in	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
offer	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sins:	1
5:2	1
Who	1
can	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
also	1
is	1
compassed	1
with	1
infirmity.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
by	1
reason	1
hereof	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
also	1
for	1
himself,	1
to	1
offer	1
for	1
sins.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
this	1
honour	1
unto	1
himself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
was	1
Aaron.	1
	1
5:5	1
So	1
also	1
Christ	1
glorified	1
not	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
to	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
5:6	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:7	1
Who	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
up	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications	1
with	1
strong	1
crying	1
and	1
tears	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
feared;	1
5:8	1
Though	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
Son,	1
yet	1
learned	1
he	1
obedience	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
suffered;	1
5:9	1
And	1
being	1
made	1
perfect,	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
eternal	1
salvation	1
unto	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him;	1
5:10	1
Called	1
of	1
God	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
5:11	1
Of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
uttered,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
when	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
teachers,	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
that	1
one	1
teach	1
you	1
again	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
strong	1
meat.	1
	1
5:13	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
useth	1
milk	1
is	1
unskilful	1
in	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
babe.	1
	1
5:14	1
But	1
strong	1
meat	1
belongeth	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
full	1
age,	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
use	1
have	1
their	1
senses	1
exercised	1
to	1
discern	1
both	1
good	1
and	1
evil.	1
	1
6:1	1
Therefore	1
leaving	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on	1
unto	1
perfection;	1
not	1
laying	1
again	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
repentance	1
from	1
dead	1
works,	1
and	1
of	1
faith	1
toward	1
God,	1
6:2	1
Of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
baptisms,	1
and	1
of	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
hands,	1
and	1
of	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
of	1
eternal	1
judgment.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
we	1
do,	1
if	1
God	1
permit.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
once	1
enlightened,	1
and	1
have	1
tasted	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
gift,	1
and	1
were	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
6:5	1
And	1
have	1
tasted	1
the	1
good	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come,	1
6:6	1
If	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
away,	1
to	1
renew	1
them	1
again	1
unto	1
repentance;	1
seeing	1
they	1
crucify	1
to	1
themselves	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
afresh,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
shame.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
drinketh	1
in	1
the	1
rain	1
that	1
cometh	1
oft	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
herbs	1
meet	1
for	1
them	1
by	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
dressed,	1
receiveth	1
blessing	1
from	1
God:	1
6:8	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
beareth	1
thorns	1
and	1
briers	1
is	1
rejected,	1
and	1
is	1
nigh	1
unto	1
cursing;	1
whose	1
end	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
burned.	1
	1
6:9	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
we	1
are	1
persuaded	1
better	1
things	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
accompany	1
salvation,	1
though	1
we	1
thus	1
speak.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
unrighteous	1
to	1
forget	1
your	1
work	1
and	1
labour	1
of	1
love,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
shewed	1
toward	1
his	1
name,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
do	1
minister.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
we	1
desire	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
same	1
diligence	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
hope	1
unto	1
the	1
end:	1
6:12	1
That	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
slothful,	1
but	1
followers	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
through	1
faith	1
and	1
patience	1
inherit	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
6:13	1
For	1
when	1
God	1
made	1
promise	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
by	1
no	1
greater,	1
he	1
sware	1
by	1
himself,	1
6:14	1
Saying,	1
Surely	1
blessing	1
I	1
will	1
bless	1
thee,	1
and	1
multiplying	1
I	1
will	1
multiply	1
thee.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
patiently	1
endured,	1
he	1
obtained	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
men	1
verily	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
greater:	1
and	1
an	1
oath	1
for	1
confirmation	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
strife.	1
	1
6:17	1
Wherein	1
God,	1
willing	1
more	1
abundantly	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
heirs	1
of	1
promise	1
the	1
immutability	1
of	1
his	1
counsel,	1
confirmed	1
it	1
by	1
an	1
oath:	1
6:18	1
That	1
by	1
two	1
immutable	1
things,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
God	1
to	1
lie,	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
consolation,	1
who	1
have	1
fled	1
for	1
refuge	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
upon	1
the	1
hope	1
set	1
before	1
us:	1
6:19	1
Which	1
hope	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
an	1
anchor	1
of	1
the	1
soul,	1
both	1
sure	1
and	1
stedfast,	1
and	1
which	1
entereth	1
into	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
veil;	1
6:20	1
Whither	1
the	1
forerunner	1
is	1
for	1
us	1
entered,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
made	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:1	1
For	1
this	1
Melchisedec,	1
king	1
of	1
Salem,	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
who	1
met	1
Abraham	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him;	1
7:2	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
all;	1
first	1
being	1
by	1
interpretation	1
King	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
also	1
King	1
of	1
Salem,	1
which	1
is,	1
King	1
of	1
peace;	1
7:3	1
Without	1
father,	1
without	1
mother,	1
without	1
descent,	1
having	1
neither	1
beginning	1
of	1
days,	1
nor	1
end	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
abideth	1
a	1
priest	1
continually.	1
	1
7:4	1
Now	1
consider	1
how	1
great	1
this	1
man	1
was,	1
unto	1
whom	1
even	1
the	1
patriarch	1
Abraham	1
gave	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
the	1
spoils.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
verily	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
who	1
receive	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
priesthood,	1
have	1
a	1
commandment	1
to	1
take	1
tithes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
their	1
brethren,	1
though	1
they	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
Abraham:	1
7:6	1
But	1
he	1
whose	1
descent	1
is	1
not	1
counted	1
from	1
them	1
received	1
tithes	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
blessed	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
promises.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
without	1
all	1
contradiction	1
the	1
less	1
is	1
blessed	1
of	1
the	1
better.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
here	1
men	1
that	1
die	1
receive	1
tithes;	1
but	1
there	1
he	1
receiveth	1
them,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
witnessed	1
that	1
he	1
liveth.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
say,	1
Levi	1
also,	1
who	1
receiveth	1
tithes,	1
payed	1
tithes	1
in	1
Abraham.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
when	1
Melchisedec	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
perfection	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
Levitical	1
priesthood,	1
(for	1
under	1
it	1
the	1
people	1
received	1
the	1
law,)	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
was	1
there	1
that	1
another	1
priest	1
should	1
rise	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Aaron?	1
	1
7:12	1
For	1
the	1
priesthood	1
being	1
changed,	1
there	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
necessity	1
a	1
change	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
7:13	1
For	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
spoken	1
pertaineth	1
to	1
another	1
tribe,	1
of	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
attendance	1
at	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
our	1
Lord	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
Juda;	1
of	1
which	1
tribe	1
Moses	1
spake	1
nothing	1
concerning	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
far	1
more	1
evident:	1
for	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Melchisedec	1
there	1
ariseth	1
another	1
priest,	1
7:16	1
Who	1
is	1
made,	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
a	1
carnal	1
commandment,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
an	1
endless	1
life.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
he	1
testifieth,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
verily	1
a	1
disannulling	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
going	1
before	1
for	1
the	1
weakness	1
and	1
unprofitableness	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
made	1
nothing	1
perfect,	1
but	1
the	1
bringing	1
in	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
hope	1
did;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
we	1
draw	1
nigh	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
oath	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
priest:	1
7:21	1
(For	1
those	1
priests	1
were	1
made	1
without	1
an	1
oath;	1
but	1
this	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Lord	1
sware	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
repent,	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
priest	1
for	1
ever	1
after	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Melchisedec:)	1
7:22	1
By	1
so	1
much	1
was	1
Jesus	1
made	1
a	1
surety	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
testament.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
they	1
truly	1
were	1
many	1
priests,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
suffered	1
to	1
continue	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
death:	1
7:24	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
because	1
he	1
continueth	1
ever,	1
hath	1
an	1
unchangeable	1
priesthood.	1
	1
7:25	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
that	1
come	1
unto	1
God	1
by	1
him,	1
seeing	1
he	1
ever	1
liveth	1
to	1
make	1
intercession	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
7:26	1
For	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
became	1
us,	1
who	1
is	1
holy,	1
harmless,	1
undefiled,	1
separate	1
from	1
sinners,	1
and	1
made	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
heavens;	1
7:27	1
Who	1
needeth	1
not	1
daily,	1
as	1
those	1
high	1
priests,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
sacrifice,	1
first	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins,	1
and	1
then	1
for	1
the	1
people's:	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
did	1
once,	1
when	1
he	1
offered	1
up	1
himself.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
maketh	1
men	1
high	1
priests	1
which	1
have	1
infirmity;	1
but	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
oath,	1
which	1
was	1
since	1
the	1
law,	1
maketh	1
the	1
Son,	1
who	1
is	1
consecrated	1
for	1
evermore.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
spoken	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sum:	1
We	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
the	1
Majesty	1
in	1
the	1
heavens;	1
8:2	1
A	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
tabernacle,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
pitched,	1
and	1
not	1
man.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
every	1
high	1
priest	1
is	1
ordained	1
to	1
offer	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices:	1
wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
necessity	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
have	1
somewhat	1
also	1
to	1
offer.	1
	1
8:4	1
For	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
on	1
earth,	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
priest,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
priests	1
that	1
offer	1
gifts	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law:	1
8:5	1
Who	1
serve	1
unto	1
the	1
example	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things,	1
as	1
Moses	1
was	1
admonished	1
of	1
God	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
tabernacle:	1
for,	1
See,	1
saith	1
he,	1
that	1
thou	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
pattern	1
shewed	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
mount.	1
	1
8:6	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
he	1
obtained	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
ministry,	1
by	1
how	1
much	1
also	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
covenant,	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
upon	1
better	1
promises.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
if	1
that	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
been	1
faultless,	1
then	1
should	1
no	1
place	1
have	1
been	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
8:8	1
For	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
when	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
8:9	1
Not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
with	1
their	1
fathers	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
lead	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
because	1
they	1
continued	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
I	1
regarded	1
them	1
not,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
mind,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
God,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
people:	1
8:11	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
teach	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother,	1
saying,	1
Know	1
the	1
Lord:	1
for	1
all	1
shall	1
know	1
me,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
their	1
unrighteousness,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
their	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
new	1
covenant,	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
old.	1
Now	1
that	1
which	1
decayeth	1
and	1
waxeth	1
old	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
verily	1
the	1
first	1
covenant	1
had	1
also	1
ordinances	1
of	1
divine	1
service,	1
and	1
a	1
worldly	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:2	1
For	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
made;	1
the	1
first,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
candlestick,	1
and	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
shewbread;	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
sanctuary.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
second	1
veil,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Holiest	1
of	1
all;	1
9:4	1
Which	1
had	1
the	1
golden	1
censer,	1
and	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
overlaid	1
round	1
about	1
with	1
gold,	1
wherein	1
was	1
the	1
golden	1
pot	1
that	1
had	1
manna,	1
and	1
Aaron's	1
rod	1
that	1
budded,	1
and	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
covenant;	1
9:5	1
And	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
cherubims	1
of	1
glory	1
shadowing	1
the	1
mercyseat;	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
now	1
speak	1
particularly.	1
	1
9:6	1
Now	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
thus	1
ordained,	1
the	1
priests	1
went	1
always	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle,	1
accomplishing	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:7	1
But	1
into	1
the	1
second	1
went	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
alone	1
once	1
every	1
year,	1
not	1
without	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
offered	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
9:8	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
this	1
signifying,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
manifest,	1
while	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
tabernacle	1
was	1
yet	1
standing:	1
9:9	1
Which	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
then	1
present,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
offered	1
both	1
gifts	1
and	1
sacrifices,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
that	1
did	1
the	1
service	1
perfect,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
conscience;	1
9:10	1
Which	1
stood	1
only	1
in	1
meats	1
and	1
drinks,	1
and	1
divers	1
washings,	1
and	1
carnal	1
ordinances,	1
imposed	1
on	1
them	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
reformation.	1
	1
9:11	1
But	1
Christ	1
being	1
come	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
perfect	1
tabernacle,	1
not	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
building;	1
9:12	1
Neither	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
calves,	1
but	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
he	1
entered	1
in	1
once	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
having	1
obtained	1
eternal	1
redemption	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:13	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
and	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
an	1
heifer	1
sprinkling	1
the	1
unclean,	1
sanctifieth	1
to	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:14	1
How	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
who	1
through	1
the	1
eternal	1
Spirit	1
offered	1
himself	1
without	1
spot	1
to	1
God,	1
purge	1
your	1
conscience	1
from	1
dead	1
works	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
living	1
God?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
death,	1
for	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
the	1
transgressions	1
that	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
testament,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
eternal	1
inheritance.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
where	1
a	1
testament	1
is,	1
there	1
must	1
also	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
testator.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
a	1
testament	1
is	1
of	1
force	1
after	1
men	1
are	1
dead:	1
otherwise	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
strength	1
at	1
all	1
while	1
the	1
testator	1
liveth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Whereupon	1
neither	1
the	1
first	1
testament	1
was	1
dedicated	1
without	1
blood.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
when	1
Moses	1
had	1
spoken	1
every	1
precept	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
calves	1
and	1
of	1
goats,	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
scarlet	1
wool,	1
and	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
sprinkled	1
both	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
9:20	1
Saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
testament	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
enjoined	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:21	1
Moreover	1
he	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
blood	1
both	1
the	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
ministry.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
almost	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
purged	1
with	1
blood;	1
and	1
without	1
shedding	1
of	1
blood	1
is	1
no	1
remission.	1
	1
9:23	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
patterns	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
should	1
be	1
purified	1
with	1
these;	1
but	1
the	1
heavenly	1
things	1
themselves	1
with	1
better	1
sacrifices	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
not	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
places	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
the	1
true;	1
but	1
into	1
heaven	1
itself,	1
now	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
us:	1
9:25	1
Nor	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
himself	1
often,	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
place	1
every	1
year	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
others;	1
9:26	1
For	1
then	1
must	1
he	1
often	1
have	1
suffered	1
since	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
now	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
appointed	1
unto	1
men	1
once	1
to	1
die,	1
but	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
judgment:	1
9:28	1
So	1
Christ	1
was	1
once	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
many;	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
shall	1
he	1
appear	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
without	1
sin	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:1	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
having	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
things,	1
can	1
never	1
with	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
which	1
they	1
offered	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
continually	1
make	1
the	1
comers	1
thereunto	1
perfect.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
then	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
offered?	1
because	1
that	1
the	1
worshippers	1
once	1
purged	1
should	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
conscience	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:3	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
sacrifices	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remembrance	1
again	1
made	1
of	1
sins	1
every	1
year.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
bulls	1
and	1
of	1
goats	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
sins.	1
	1
10:5	1
Wherefore	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
but	1
a	1
body	1
hast	1
thou	1
prepared	1
me:	1
10:6	1
In	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
(in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
me,)	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
	1
10:8	1
Above	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
Sacrifice	1
and	1
offering	1
and	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
offering	1
for	1
sin	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not,	1
neither	1
hadst	1
pleasure	1
therein;	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
10:9	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will,	1
O	1
God.	1
He	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
establish	1
the	1
second.	1
	1
10:10	1
By	1
the	1
which	1
will	1
we	1
are	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
once	1
for	1
all.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
every	1
priest	1
standeth	1
daily	1
ministering	1
and	1
offering	1
oftentimes	1
the	1
same	1
sacrifices,	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
take	1
away	1
sins:	1
10:12	1
But	1
this	1
man,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
one	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins	1
for	1
ever,	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
10:13	1
From	1
henceforth	1
expecting	1
till	1
his	1
enemies	1
be	1
made	1
his	1
footstool.	1
	1
10:14	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
offering	1
he	1
hath	1
perfected	1
for	1
ever	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
10:15	1
Whereof	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
us:	1
for	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
10:16	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
covenant	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
with	1
them	1
after	1
those	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
laws	1
into	1
their	1
hearts,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
minds	1
will	1
I	1
write	1
them;	1
10:17	1
And	1
their	1
sins	1
and	1
iniquities	1
will	1
I	1
remember	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
10:18	1
Now	1
where	1
remission	1
of	1
these	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
offering	1
for	1
sin.	1
	1
10:19	1
Having	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
boldness	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
holiest	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
10:20	1
By	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
living	1
way,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
consecrated	1
for	1
us,	1
through	1
the	1
veil,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
flesh;	1
10:21	1
And	1
having	1
an	1
high	1
priest	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God;	1
10:22	1
Let	1
us	1
draw	1
near	1
with	1
a	1
true	1
heart	1
in	1
full	1
assurance	1
of	1
faith,	1
having	1
our	1
hearts	1
sprinkled	1
from	1
an	1
evil	1
conscience,	1
and	1
our	1
bodies	1
washed	1
with	1
pure	1
water.	1
	1
10:23	1
Let	1
us	1
hold	1
fast	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
our	1
faith	1
without	1
wavering;	1
(for	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
that	1
promised;)	1
10:24	1
And	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
provoke	1
unto	1
love	1
and	1
to	1
good	1
works:	1
10:25	1
Not	1
forsaking	1
the	1
assembling	1
of	1
ourselves	1
together,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
some	1
is;	1
but	1
exhorting	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
day	1
approaching.	1
	1
10:26	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
sin	1
wilfully	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
there	1
remaineth	1
no	1
more	1
sacrifice	1
for	1
sins,	1
10:27	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
fearful	1
looking	1
for	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
fiery	1
indignation,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
adversaries.	1
	1
10:28	1
He	1
that	1
despised	1
Moses'	1
law	1
died	1
without	1
mercy	1
under	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses:	1
10:29	1
Of	1
how	1
much	1
sorer	1
punishment,	1
suppose	1
ye,	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
thought	1
worthy,	1
who	1
hath	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
hath	1
counted	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
sanctified,	1
an	1
unholy	1
thing,	1
and	1
hath	1
done	1
despite	1
unto	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
grace?	1
10:30	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
said,	1
Vengeance	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
recompense,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
shall	1
judge	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
10:31	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
fearful	1
thing	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
But	1
call	1
to	1
remembrance	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
in	1
which,	1
after	1
ye	1
were	1
illuminated,	1
ye	1
endured	1
a	1
great	1
fight	1
of	1
afflictions;	1
10:33	1
Partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
were	1
made	1
a	1
gazingstock	1
both	1
by	1
reproaches	1
and	1
afflictions;	1
and	1
partly,	1
whilst	1
ye	1
became	1
companions	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
used.	1
	1
10:34	1
For	1
ye	1
had	1
compassion	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
bonds,	1
and	1
took	1
joyfully	1
the	1
spoiling	1
of	1
your	1
goods,	1
knowing	1
in	1
yourselves	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
in	1
heaven	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
an	1
enduring	1
substance.	1
	1
10:35	1
Cast	1
not	1
away	1
therefore	1
your	1
confidence,	1
which	1
hath	1
great	1
recompence	1
of	1
reward.	1
	1
10:36	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
patience,	1
that,	1
after	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
promise.	1
	1
10:37	1
For	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
will	1
come,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
draw	1
back,	1
my	1
soul	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
draw	1
back	1
unto	1
perdition;	1
but	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
the	1
soul.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
faith	1
is	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
things	1
hoped	1
for,	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen.	1
	1
11:2	1
For	1
by	1
it	1
the	1
elders	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report.	1
	1
11:3	1
Through	1
faith	1
we	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
worlds	1
were	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
so	1
that	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
seen	1
were	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
do	1
appear.	1
	1
11:4	1
By	1
faith	1
Abel	1
offered	1
unto	1
God	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
sacrifice	1
than	1
Cain,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
obtained	1
witness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
righteous,	1
God	1
testifying	1
of	1
his	1
gifts:	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
being	1
dead	1
yet	1
speaketh.	1
	1
11:5	1
By	1
faith	1
Enoch	1
was	1
translated	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death;	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
found,	1
because	1
God	1
had	1
translated	1
him:	1
for	1
before	1
his	1
translation	1
he	1
had	1
this	1
testimony,	1
that	1
he	1
pleased	1
God.	1
	1
11:6	1
But	1
without	1
faith	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
please	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
God	1
must	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
rewarder	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
diligently	1
seek	1
him.	1
	1
11:7	1
By	1
faith	1
Noah,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
things	1
not	1
seen	1
as	1
yet,	1
moved	1
with	1
fear,	1
prepared	1
an	1
ark	1
to	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
his	1
house;	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
condemned	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
became	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
11:8	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
after	1
receive	1
for	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
obeyed;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whither	1
he	1
went.	1
	1
11:9	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
sojourned	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
promise,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
country,	1
dwelling	1
in	1
tabernacles	1
with	1
Isaac	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
heirs	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
promise:	1
11:10	1
For	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
city	1
which	1
hath	1
foundations,	1
whose	1
builder	1
and	1
maker	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:11	1
Through	1
faith	1
also	1
Sara	1
herself	1
received	1
strength	1
to	1
conceive	1
seed,	1
and	1
was	1
delivered	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
past	1
age,	1
because	1
she	1
judged	1
him	1
faithful	1
who	1
had	1
promised.	1
	1
11:12	1
Therefore	1
sprang	1
there	1
even	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
dead,	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
in	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
shore	1
innumerable.	1
	1
11:13	1
These	1
all	1
died	1
in	1
faith,	1
not	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
promises,	1
but	1
having	1
seen	1
them	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
were	1
persuaded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:14	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
say	1
such	1
things	1
declare	1
plainly	1
that	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
country.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
truly,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
mindful	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
opportunity	1
to	1
have	1
returned.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
now	1
they	1
desire	1
a	1
better	1
country,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
heavenly:	1
wherefore	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
a	1
city.	1
	1
11:17	1
By	1
faith	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tried,	1
offered	1
up	1
Isaac:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
promises	1
offered	1
up	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
son,	1
11:18	1
Of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
That	1
in	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called:	1
11:19	1
Accounting	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
up,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
from	1
whence	1
also	1
he	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
figure.	1
	1
11:20	1
By	1
faith	1
Isaac	1
blessed	1
Jacob	1
and	1
Esau	1
concerning	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:21	1
By	1
faith	1
Jacob,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
dying,	1
blessed	1
both	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Joseph;	1
and	1
worshipped,	1
leaning	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
staff.	1
	1
11:22	1
By	1
faith	1
Joseph,	1
when	1
he	1
died,	1
made	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
departing	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
his	1
bones.	1
	1
11:23	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
born,	1
was	1
hid	1
three	1
months	1
of	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
proper	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment.	1
	1
11:24	1
By	1
faith	1
Moses,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
years,	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter;	1
11:25	1
Choosing	1
rather	1
to	1
suffer	1
affliction	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God,	1
than	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
sin	1
for	1
a	1
season;	1
11:26	1
Esteeming	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Christ	1
greater	1
riches	1
than	1
the	1
treasures	1
in	1
Egypt:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
respect	1
unto	1
the	1
recompence	1
of	1
the	1
reward.	1
	1
11:27	1
By	1
faith	1
he	1
forsook	1
Egypt,	1
not	1
fearing	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
king:	1
for	1
he	1
endured,	1
as	1
seeing	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
invisible.	1
	1
11:28	1
Through	1
faith	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
blood,	1
lest	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
the	1
firstborn	1
should	1
touch	1
them.	1
	1
11:29	1
By	1
faith	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
Red	1
sea	1
as	1
by	1
dry	1
land:	1
which	1
the	1
Egyptians	1
assaying	1
to	1
do	1
were	1
drowned.	1
	1
11:30	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
Jericho	1
fell	1
down,	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
compassed	1
about	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
11:31	1
By	1
faith	1
the	1
harlot	1
Rahab	1
perished	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
spies	1
with	1
peace.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
more	1
say?	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
fail	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
of	1
Gedeon,	1
and	1
of	1
Barak,	1
and	1
of	1
Samson,	1
and	1
of	1
Jephthae;	1
of	1
David	1
also,	1
and	1
Samuel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
prophets:	1
11:33	1
Who	1
through	1
faith	1
subdued	1
kingdoms,	1
wrought	1
righteousness,	1
obtained	1
promises,	1
stopped	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
11:34	1
Quenched	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
fire,	1
escaped	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
out	1
of	1
weakness	1
were	1
made	1
strong,	1
waxed	1
valiant	1
in	1
fight,	1
turned	1
to	1
flight	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
the	1
aliens.	1
	1
11:35	1
Women	1
received	1
their	1
dead	1
raised	1
to	1
life	1
again:	1
and	1
others	1
were	1
tortured,	1
not	1
accepting	1
deliverance;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
obtain	1
a	1
better	1
resurrection:	1
11:36	1
And	1
others	1
had	1
trial	1
of	1
cruel	1
mockings	1
and	1
scourgings,	1
yea,	1
moreover	1
of	1
bonds	1
and	1
imprisonment:	1
11:37	1
They	1
were	1
stoned,	1
they	1
were	1
sawn	1
asunder,	1
were	1
tempted,	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
they	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
goatskins;	1
being	1
destitute,	1
afflicted,	1
tormented;	1
11:38	1
(Of	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
not	1
worthy:)	1
they	1
wandered	1
in	1
deserts,	1
and	1
in	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
dens	1
and	1
caves	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
these	1
all,	1
having	1
obtained	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
through	1
faith,	1
received	1
not	1
the	1
promise:	1
11:40	1
God	1
having	1
provided	1
some	1
better	1
thing	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
without	1
us	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
perfect.	1
	1
12:1	1
Wherefore	1
seeing	1
we	1
also	1
are	1
compassed	1
about	1
with	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
witnesses,	1
let	1
us	1
lay	1
aside	1
every	1
weight,	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
which	1
doth	1
so	1
easily	1
beset	1
us,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
run	1
with	1
patience	1
the	1
race	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
us,	1
12:2	1
Looking	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
the	1
author	1
and	1
finisher	1
of	1
our	1
faith;	1
who	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
that	1
was	1
set	1
before	1
him	1
endured	1
the	1
cross,	1
despising	1
the	1
shame,	1
and	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
consider	1
him	1
that	1
endured	1
such	1
contradiction	1
of	1
sinners	1
against	1
himself,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
wearied	1
and	1
faint	1
in	1
your	1
minds.	1
	1
12:4	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
resisted	1
unto	1
blood,	1
striving	1
against	1
sin.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
forgotten	1
the	1
exhortation	1
which	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
children,	1
My	1
son,	1
despise	1
not	1
thou	1
the	1
chastening	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
nor	1
faint	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
rebuked	1
of	1
him:	1
12:6	1
For	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
loveth	1
he	1
chasteneth,	1
and	1
scourgeth	1
every	1
son	1
whom	1
he	1
receiveth.	1
	1
12:7	1
If	1
ye	1
endure	1
chastening,	1
God	1
dealeth	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
with	1
sons;	1
for	1
what	1
son	1
is	1
he	1
whom	1
the	1
father	1
chasteneth	1
not?	1
	1
12:8	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
without	1
chastisement,	1
whereof	1
all	1
are	1
partakers,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
bastards,	1
and	1
not	1
sons.	1
	1
12:9	1
Furthermore	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
fathers	1
of	1
our	1
flesh	1
which	1
corrected	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
gave	1
them	1
reverence:	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
much	1
rather	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
live?	1
	1
12:10	1
For	1
they	1
verily	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
chastened	1
us	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
he	1
for	1
our	1
profit,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
his	1
holiness.	1
	1
12:11	1
Now	1
no	1
chastening	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
joyous,	1
but	1
grievous:	1
nevertheless	1
afterward	1
it	1
yieldeth	1
the	1
peaceable	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
exercised	1
thereby.	1
	1
12:12	1
Wherefore	1
lift	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
hang	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
feeble	1
knees;	1
12:13	1
And	1
make	1
straight	1
paths	1
for	1
your	1
feet,	1
lest	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lame	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
but	1
let	1
it	1
rather	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
12:14	1
Follow	1
peace	1
with	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
holiness,	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Lord:	1
12:15	1
Looking	1
diligently	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
fail	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God;	1
lest	1
any	1
root	1
of	1
bitterness	1
springing	1
up	1
trouble	1
you,	1
and	1
thereby	1
many	1
be	1
defiled;	1
12:16	1
Lest	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
profane	1
person,	1
as	1
Esau,	1
who	1
for	1
one	1
morsel	1
of	1
meat	1
sold	1
his	1
birthright.	1
	1
12:17	1
For	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
afterward,	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
inherited	1
the	1
blessing,	1
he	1
was	1
rejected:	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
of	1
repentance,	1
though	1
he	1
sought	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
touched,	1
and	1
that	1
burned	1
with	1
fire,	1
nor	1
unto	1
blackness,	1
and	1
darkness,	1
and	1
tempest,	1
12:19	1
And	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
words;	1
which	1
voice	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
intreated	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
spoken	1
to	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
12:20	1
(For	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
commanded,	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
beast	1
touch	1
the	1
mountain,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
stoned,	1
or	1
thrust	1
through	1
with	1
a	1
dart:	1
12:21	1
And	1
so	1
terrible	1
was	1
the	1
sight,	1
that	1
Moses	1
said,	1
I	1
exceedingly	1
fear	1
and	1
quake:)	1
12:22	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
come	1
unto	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
the	1
heavenly	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
innumerable	1
company	1
of	1
angels,	1
12:23	1
To	1
the	1
general	1
assembly	1
and	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
firstborn,	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
just	1
men	1
made	1
perfect,	1
12:24	1
And	1
to	1
Jesus	1
the	1
mediator	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
covenant,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
sprinkling,	1
that	1
speaketh	1
better	1
things	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Abel.	1
	1
12:25	1
See	1
that	1
ye	1
refuse	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh.	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
escaped	1
not	1
who	1
refused	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
on	1
earth,	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
not	1
we	1
escape,	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
from	1
heaven:	1
12:26	1
Whose	1
voice	1
then	1
shook	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
hath	1
promised,	1
saying,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
shake	1
not	1
the	1
earth	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
this	1
word,	1
Yet	1
once	1
more,	1
signifieth	1
the	1
removing	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
shaken,	1
as	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
shaken	1
may	1
remain.	1
	1
12:28	1
Wherefore	1
we	1
receiving	1
a	1
kingdom	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
moved,	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
grace,	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
serve	1
God	1
acceptably	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
godly	1
fear:	1
12:29	1
For	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
consuming	1
fire.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
brotherly	1
love	1
continue.	1
	1
13:2	1
Be	1
not	1
forgetful	1
to	1
entertain	1
strangers:	1
for	1
thereby	1
some	1
have	1
entertained	1
angels	1
unawares.	1
	1
13:3	1
Remember	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
bonds,	1
as	1
bound	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
suffer	1
adversity,	1
as	1
being	1
yourselves	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
13:4	1
Marriage	1
is	1
honourable	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
bed	1
undefiled:	1
but	1
whoremongers	1
and	1
adulterers	1
God	1
will	1
judge.	1
	1
13:5	1
Let	1
your	1
conversation	1
be	1
without	1
covetousness;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
leave	1
thee,	1
nor	1
forsake	1
thee.	1
	1
13:6	1
So	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
boldly	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
my	1
helper,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fear	1
what	1
man	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Remember	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God:	1
whose	1
faith	1
follow,	1
considering	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
conversation.	1
	1
13:8	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
same	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
13:9	1
Be	1
not	1
carried	1
about	1
with	1
divers	1
and	1
strange	1
doctrines.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
heart	1
be	1
established	1
with	1
grace;	1
not	1
with	1
meats,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
profited	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
occupied	1
therein.	1
	1
13:10	1
We	1
have	1
an	1
altar,	1
whereof	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
eat	1
which	1
serve	1
the	1
tabernacle.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
beasts,	1
whose	1
blood	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
by	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
for	1
sin,	1
are	1
burned	1
without	1
the	1
camp.	1
	1
13:12	1
Wherefore	1
Jesus	1
also,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
sanctify	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood,	1
suffered	1
without	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
forth	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
camp,	1
bearing	1
his	1
reproach.	1
	1
13:14	1
For	1
here	1
have	1
we	1
no	1
continuing	1
city,	1
but	1
we	1
seek	1
one	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
13:15	1
By	1
him	1
therefore	1
let	1
us	1
offer	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
praise	1
to	1
God	1
continually,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
our	1
lips	1
giving	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
communicate	1
forget	1
not:	1
for	1
with	1
such	1
sacrifices	1
God	1
is	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
13:17	1
Obey	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
submit	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
watch	1
for	1
your	1
souls,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
must	1
give	1
account,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
grief:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
unprofitable	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
13:18	1
Pray	1
for	1
us:	1
for	1
we	1
trust	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
conscience,	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
willing	1
to	1
live	1
honestly.	1
	1
13:19	1
But	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
the	1
rather	1
to	1
do	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
restored	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
sooner.	1
	1
13:20	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace,	1
that	1
brought	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
great	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
through	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
covenant,	1
13:21	1
Make	1
you	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
good	1
work	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
working	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
wellpleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
suffer	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
13:23	1
Know	1
ye	1
that	1
our	1
brother	1
Timothy	1
is	1
set	1
at	1
liberty;	1
with	1
whom,	1
if	1
he	1
come	1
shortly,	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you.	1
	1
13:24	1
Salute	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
rule	1
over	1
you,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
They	1
of	1
Italy	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
13:25	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
James	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
James,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
which	1
are	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
greeting.	1
	1
1:2	1
My	1
brethren,	1
count	1
it	1
all	1
joy	1
when	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
divers	1
temptations;	1
1:3	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
trying	1
of	1
your	1
faith	1
worketh	1
patience.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
let	1
patience	1
have	1
her	1
perfect	1
work,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
perfect	1
and	1
entire,	1
wanting	1
nothing.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
lack	1
wisdom,	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
liberally,	1
and	1
upbraideth	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
ask	1
in	1
faith,	1
nothing	1
wavering.	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
wavereth	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
tossed.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
let	1
not	1
that	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:8	1
A	1
double	1
minded	1
man	1
is	1
unstable	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:9	1
Let	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
low	1
degree	1
rejoice	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
exalted:	1
1:10	1
But	1
the	1
rich,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
low:	1
because	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
no	1
sooner	1
risen	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
heat,	1
but	1
it	1
withereth	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth,	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
it	1
perisheth:	1
so	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
fade	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
	1
1:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
endureth	1
temptation:	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tried,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
tempted,	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
cannot	1
be	1
tempted	1
with	1
evil,	1
neither	1
tempteth	1
he	1
any	1
man:	1
1:14	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
tempted,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
drawn	1
away	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
lust,	1
and	1
enticed.	1
	1
1:15	1
Then	1
when	1
lust	1
hath	1
conceived,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
sin:	1
and	1
sin,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
finished,	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
death.	1
	1
1:16	1
Do	1
not	1
err,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:17	1
Every	1
good	1
gift	1
and	1
every	1
perfect	1
gift	1
is	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
lights,	1
with	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
variableness,	1
neither	1
shadow	1
of	1
turning.	1
	1
1:18	1
Of	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
begat	1
he	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
truth,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
his	1
creatures.	1
	1
1:19	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
swift	1
to	1
hear,	1
slow	1
to	1
speak,	1
slow	1
to	1
wrath:	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
man	1
worketh	1
not	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
lay	1
apart	1
all	1
filthiness	1
and	1
superfluity	1
of	1
naughtiness,	1
and	1
receive	1
with	1
meekness	1
the	1
engrafted	1
word,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:22	1
But	1
be	1
ye	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
hearers	1
only,	1
deceiving	1
your	1
own	1
selves.	1
	1
1:23	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
be	1
a	1
hearer	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
doer,	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
beholding	1
his	1
natural	1
face	1
in	1
a	1
glass:	1
1:24	1
For	1
he	1
beholdeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
goeth	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
straightway	1
forgetteth	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
1:25	1
But	1
whoso	1
looketh	1
into	1
the	1
perfect	1
law	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
continueth	1
therein,	1
he	1
being	1
not	1
a	1
forgetful	1
hearer,	1
but	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
blessed	1
in	1
his	1
deed.	1
	1
1:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
religious,	1
and	1
bridleth	1
not	1
his	1
tongue,	1
but	1
deceiveth	1
his	1
own	1
heart,	1
this	1
man's	1
religion	1
is	1
vain.	1
	1
1:27	1
Pure	1
religion	1
and	1
undefiled	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
this,	1
To	1
visit	1
the	1
fatherless	1
and	1
widows	1
in	1
their	1
affliction,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
unspotted	1
from	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory,	1
with	1
respect	1
of	1
persons.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
come	1
unto	1
your	1
assembly	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
gold	1
ring,	1
in	1
goodly	1
apparel,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
also	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
in	1
vile	1
raiment;	1
2:3	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
weareth	1
the	1
gay	1
clothing,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
place;	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
Stand	1
thou	1
there,	1
or	1
sit	1
here	1
under	1
my	1
footstool:	1
2:4	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
partial	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
are	1
become	1
judges	1
of	1
evil	1
thoughts?	1
	1
2:5	1
Hearken,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
Hath	1
not	1
God	1
chosen	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
rich	1
in	1
faith,	1
and	1
heirs	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him?	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
poor.	1
Do	1
not	1
rich	1
men	1
oppress	1
you,	1
and	1
draw	1
you	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seats?	1
	1
2:7	1
Do	1
not	1
they	1
blaspheme	1
that	1
worthy	1
name	1
by	1
the	1
which	1
ye	1
are	1
called?	1
	1
2:8	1
If	1
ye	1
fulfil	1
the	1
royal	1
law	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself,	1
ye	1
do	1
well:	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
respect	1
to	1
persons,	1
ye	1
commit	1
sin,	1
and	1
are	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
transgressors.	1
	1
2:10	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
whole	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
offend	1
in	1
one	1
point,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
said,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
said	1
also,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill.	1
Now	1
if	1
thou	1
commit	1
no	1
adultery,	1
yet	1
if	1
thou	1
kill,	1
thou	1
art	1
become	1
a	1
transgressor	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:12	1
So	1
speak	1
ye,	1
and	1
so	1
do,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
liberty.	1
	1
2:13	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
judgment	1
without	1
mercy,	1
that	1
hath	1
shewed	1
no	1
mercy;	1
and	1
mercy	1
rejoiceth	1
against	1
judgment.	1
	1
2:14	1
What	1
doth	1
it	1
profit,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
say	1
he	1
hath	1
faith,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
works?	1
can	1
faith	1
save	1
him?	1
	1
2:15	1
If	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
sister	1
be	1
naked,	1
and	1
destitute	1
of	1
daily	1
food,	1
2:16	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
be	1
ye	1
warmed	1
and	1
filled;	1
notwithstanding	1
ye	1
give	1
them	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
needful	1
to	1
the	1
body;	1
what	1
doth	1
it	1
profit?	1
	1
2:17	1
Even	1
so	1
faith,	1
if	1
it	1
hath	1
not	1
works,	1
is	1
dead,	1
being	1
alone.	1
	1
2:18	1
Yea,	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
say,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
faith,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
works:	1
shew	1
me	1
thy	1
faith	1
without	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
my	1
faith	1
by	1
my	1
works.	1
	1
2:19	1
Thou	1
believest	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
thou	1
doest	1
well:	1
the	1
devils	1
also	1
believe,	1
and	1
tremble.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
wilt	1
thou	1
know,	1
O	1
vain	1
man,	1
that	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead?	1
2:21	1
Was	1
not	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
offered	1
Isaac	1
his	1
son	1
upon	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
2:22	1
Seest	1
thou	1
how	1
faith	1
wrought	1
with	1
his	1
works,	1
and	1
by	1
works	1
was	1
faith	1
made	1
perfect?	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
saith,	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Friend	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:24	1
Ye	1
see	1
then	1
how	1
that	1
by	1
works	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
faith	1
only.	1
	1
2:25	1
Likewise	1
also	1
was	1
not	1
Rahab	1
the	1
harlot	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
messengers,	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
out	1
another	1
way?	1
2:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
without	1
the	1
spirit	1
is	1
dead,	1
so	1
faith	1
without	1
works	1
is	1
dead	1
also.	1
	1
3:1	1
My	1
brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
many	1
masters,	1
knowing	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
condemnation.	1
	1
3:2	1
For	1
in	1
many	1
things	1
we	1
offend	1
all.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
offend	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
man,	1
and	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
bridle	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:3	1
Behold,	1
we	1
put	1
bits	1
in	1
the	1
horses'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
obey	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
turn	1
about	1
their	1
whole	1
body.	1
	1
3:4	1
Behold	1
also	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
are	1
driven	1
of	1
fierce	1
winds,	1
yet	1
are	1
they	1
turned	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
helm,	1
whithersoever	1
the	1
governor	1
listeth.	1
	1
3:5	1
Even	1
so	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
member,	1
and	1
boasteth	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
Behold,	1
how	1
great	1
a	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
kindleth!	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
tongue	1
is	1
a	1
fire,	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
iniquity:	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
tongue	1
among	1
our	1
members,	1
that	1
it	1
defileth	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
and	1
setteth	1
on	1
fire	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
nature;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
of	1
hell.	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
of	1
birds,	1
and	1
of	1
serpents,	1
and	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
is	1
tamed,	1
and	1
hath	1
been	1
tamed	1
of	1
mankind:	1
3:8	1
But	1
the	1
tongue	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
tame;	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unruly	1
evil,	1
full	1
of	1
deadly	1
poison.	1
	1
3:9	1
Therewith	1
bless	1
we	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
therewith	1
curse	1
we	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mouth	1
proceedeth	1
blessing	1
and	1
cursing.	1
My	1
brethren,	1
these	1
things	1
ought	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
3:11	1
Doth	1
a	1
fountain	1
send	1
forth	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
sweet	1
water	1
and	1
bitter?	1
	1
3:12	1
Can	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
bear	1
olive	1
berries?	1
either	1
a	1
vine,	1
figs?	1
so	1
can	1
no	1
fountain	1
both	1
yield	1
salt	1
water	1
and	1
fresh.	1
	1
3:13	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
and	1
endued	1
with	1
knowledge	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
shew	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conversation	1
his	1
works	1
with	1
meekness	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
bitter	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
glory	1
not,	1
and	1
lie	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
3:15	1
This	1
wisdom	1
descendeth	1
not	1
from	1
above,	1
but	1
is	1
earthly,	1
sensual,	1
devilish.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
where	1
envying	1
and	1
strife	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
confusion	1
and	1
every	1
evil	1
work.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
the	1
wisdom	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
first	1
pure,	1
then	1
peaceable,	1
gentle,	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
intreated,	1
full	1
of	1
mercy	1
and	1
good	1
fruits,	1
without	1
partiality,	1
and	1
without	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
peace	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
make	1
peace.	1
	1
4:1	1
From	1
whence	1
come	1
wars	1
and	1
fightings	1
among	1
you?	1
come	1
they	1
not	1
hence,	1
even	1
of	1
your	1
lusts	1
that	1
war	1
in	1
your	1
members?	1
	1
4:2	1
Ye	1
lust,	1
and	1
have	1
not:	1
ye	1
kill,	1
and	1
desire	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
cannot	1
obtain:	1
ye	1
fight	1
and	1
war,	1
yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
not.	1
	1
4:3	1
Ye	1
ask,	1
and	1
receive	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
ask	1
amiss,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
consume	1
it	1
upon	1
your	1
lusts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
adulterers	1
and	1
adulteresses,	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
enmity	1
with	1
God?	1
whosoever	1
therefore	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Do	1
ye	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
in	1
vain,	1
The	1
spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us	1
lusteth	1
to	1
envy?	1
	1
4:6	1
But	1
he	1
giveth	1
more	1
grace.	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith,	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
but	1
giveth	1
grace	1
unto	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
4:7	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
to	1
God.	1
Resist	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
4:8	1
Draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
draw	1
nigh	1
to	1
you.	1
Cleanse	1
your	1
hands,	1
ye	1
sinners;	1
and	1
purify	1
your	1
hearts,	1
ye	1
double	1
minded.	1
	1
4:9	1
Be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
mourn,	1
and	1
weep:	1
let	1
your	1
laughter	1
be	1
turned	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
to	1
heaviness.	1
	1
4:10	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
lift	1
you	1
up.	1
	1
4:11	1
Speak	1
not	1
evil	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
his	1
brother,	1
speaketh	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
judgeth	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
judge	1
the	1
law,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
doer	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
a	1
judge.	1
	1
4:12	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
lawgiver,	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
save	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another?	1
	1
4:13	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
that	1
say,	1
To	1
day	1
or	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
continue	1
there	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
buy	1
and	1
sell,	1
and	1
get	1
gain:	1
4:14	1
Whereas	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
life?	1
It	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
vapour,	1
that	1
appeareth	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
vanisheth	1
away.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
that	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say,	1
If	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
we	1
shall	1
live,	1
and	1
do	1
this,	1
or	1
that.	1
	1
4:16	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
in	1
your	1
boastings:	1
all	1
such	1
rejoicing	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
4:17	1
Therefore	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knoweth	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
doeth	1
it	1
not,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
5:1	1
Go	1
to	1
now,	1
ye	1
rich	1
men,	1
weep	1
and	1
howl	1
for	1
your	1
miseries	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
5:2	1
Your	1
riches	1
are	1
corrupted,	1
and	1
your	1
garments	1
are	1
motheaten.	1
	1
5:3	1
Your	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
is	1
cankered;	1
and	1
the	1
rust	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
your	1
flesh	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
fire.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heaped	1
treasure	1
together	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
days.	1
	1
5:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
the	1
labourers	1
who	1
have	1
reaped	1
down	1
your	1
fields,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
you	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
fraud,	1
crieth:	1
and	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
reaped	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
sabaoth.	1
	1
5:5	1
Ye	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
pleasure	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
been	1
wanton;	1
ye	1
have	1
nourished	1
your	1
hearts,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
slaughter.	1
	1
5:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
condemned	1
and	1
killed	1
the	1
just;	1
and	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
resist	1
you.	1
	1
5:7	1
Be	1
patient	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
Behold,	1
the	1
husbandman	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
precious	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
long	1
patience	1
for	1
it,	1
until	1
he	1
receive	1
the	1
early	1
and	1
latter	1
rain.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
ye	1
also	1
patient;	1
stablish	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
5:9	1
Grudge	1
not	1
one	1
against	1
another,	1
brethren,	1
lest	1
ye	1
be	1
condemned:	1
behold,	1
the	1
judge	1
standeth	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
5:10	1
Take,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
the	1
prophets,	1
who	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
suffering	1
affliction,	1
and	1
of	1
patience.	1
	1
5:11	1
Behold,	1
we	1
count	1
them	1
happy	1
which	1
endure.	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
Job,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
very	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
of	1
tender	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:12	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
swear	1
not,	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
by	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
oath:	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
yea	1
be	1
yea;	1
and	1
your	1
nay,	1
nay;	1
lest	1
ye	1
fall	1
into	1
condemnation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Is	1
any	1
among	1
you	1
afflicted?	1
let	1
him	1
pray.	1
Is	1
any	1
merry?	1
let	1
him	1
sing	1
psalms.	1
	1
5:14	1
Is	1
any	1
sick	1
among	1
you?	1
let	1
him	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
pray	1
over	1
him,	1
anointing	1
him	1
with	1
oil	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
5:15	1
And	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
faith	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
raise	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
committed	1
sins,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
Confess	1
your	1
faults	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
pray	1
one	1
for	1
another,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
healed.	1
The	1
effectual	1
fervent	1
prayer	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
availeth	1
much.	1
	1
5:17	1
Elias	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
subject	1
to	1
like	1
passions	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
prayed	1
earnestly	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
rain:	1
and	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
gave	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
5:19	1
Brethren,	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
do	1
err	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
one	1
convert	1
him;	1
5:20	1
Let	1
him	1
know,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
converteth	1
the	1
sinner	1
from	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
shall	1
save	1
a	1
soul	1
from	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
hide	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Peter,	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
the	1
strangers	1
scattered	1
throughout	1
Pontus,	1
Galatia,	1
Cappadocia,	1
Asia,	1
and	1
Bithynia,	1
1:2	1
Elect	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
through	1
sanctification	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
unto	1
obedience	1
and	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
Grace	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
and	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
abundant	1
mercy	1
hath	1
begotten	1
us	1
again	1
unto	1
a	1
lively	1
hope	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
1:4	1
To	1
an	1
inheritance	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
undefiled,	1
and	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away,	1
reserved	1
in	1
heaven	1
for	1
you,	1
1:5	1
Who	1
are	1
kept	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
faith	1
unto	1
salvation	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
1:6	1
Wherein	1
ye	1
greatly	1
rejoice,	1
though	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
season,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
ye	1
are	1
in	1
heaviness	1
through	1
manifold	1
temptations:	1
1:7	1
That	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
being	1
much	1
more	1
precious	1
than	1
of	1
gold	1
that	1
perisheth,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
tried	1
with	1
fire,	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
unto	1
praise	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
at	1
the	1
appearing	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Whom	1
having	1
not	1
seen,	1
ye	1
love;	1
in	1
whom,	1
though	1
now	1
ye	1
see	1
him	1
not,	1
yet	1
believing,	1
ye	1
rejoice	1
with	1
joy	1
unspeakable	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
glory:	1
1:9	1
Receiving	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
faith,	1
even	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
1:10	1
Of	1
which	1
salvation	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
enquired	1
and	1
searched	1
diligently,	1
who	1
prophesied	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
unto	1
you:	1
1:11	1
Searching	1
what,	1
or	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
them	1
did	1
signify,	1
when	1
it	1
testified	1
beforehand	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
should	1
follow.	1
	1
1:12	1
Unto	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
revealed,	1
that	1
not	1
unto	1
themselves,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
they	1
did	1
minister	1
the	1
things,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
reported	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
which	1
things	1
the	1
angels	1
desire	1
to	1
look	1
into.	1
	1
1:13	1
Wherefore	1
gird	1
up	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
be	1
sober,	1
and	1
hope	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:14	1
As	1
obedient	1
children,	1
not	1
fashioning	1
yourselves	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
lusts	1
in	1
your	1
ignorance:	1
1:15	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
is	1
holy,	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
holy	1
in	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
conversation;	1
1:16	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Be	1
ye	1
holy;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
holy.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
Father,	1
who	1
without	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
judgeth	1
according	1
to	1
every	1
man's	1
work,	1
pass	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
your	1
sojourning	1
here	1
in	1
fear:	1
1:18	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
redeemed	1
with	1
corruptible	1
things,	1
as	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
from	1
your	1
vain	1
conversation	1
received	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
your	1
fathers;	1
1:19	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
lamb	1
without	1
blemish	1
and	1
without	1
spot:	1
1:20	1
Who	1
verily	1
was	1
foreordained	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
was	1
manifest	1
in	1
these	1
last	1
times	1
for	1
you,	1
1:21	1
Who	1
by	1
him	1
do	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
that	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
glory;	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
and	1
hope	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
1:22	1
Seeing	1
ye	1
have	1
purified	1
your	1
souls	1
in	1
obeying	1
the	1
truth	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
unto	1
unfeigned	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
pure	1
heart	1
fervently:	1
1:23	1
Being	1
born	1
again,	1
not	1
of	1
corruptible	1
seed,	1
but	1
of	1
incorruptible,	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
liveth	1
and	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:24	1
For	1
all	1
flesh	1
is	1
as	1
grass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
grass.	1
The	1
grass	1
withereth,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
thereof	1
falleth	1
away:	1
1:25	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
endureth	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
2:1	1
Wherefore	1
laying	1
aside	1
all	1
malice,	1
and	1
all	1
guile,	1
and	1
hypocrisies,	1
and	1
envies,	1
all	1
evil	1
speakings,	1
2:2	1
As	1
newborn	1
babes,	1
desire	1
the	1
sincere	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
grow	1
thereby:	1
2:3	1
If	1
so	1
be	1
ye	1
have	1
tasted	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
gracious.	1
	1
2:4	1
To	1
whom	1
coming,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
living	1
stone,	1
disallowed	1
indeed	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
chosen	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
precious,	1
2:5	1
Ye	1
also,	1
as	1
lively	1
stones,	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
a	1
spiritual	1
house,	1
an	1
holy	1
priesthood,	1
to	1
offer	1
up	1
spiritual	1
sacrifices,	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:6	1
Wherefore	1
also	1
it	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
scripture,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
chief	1
corner	1
stone,	1
elect,	1
precious:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
2:7	1
Unto	1
you	1
therefore	1
which	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
precious:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
disobedient,	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
disallowed,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
made	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner,	1
2:8	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
stumbling,	1
and	1
a	1
rock	1
of	1
offence,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
word,	1
being	1
disobedient:	1
whereunto	1
also	1
they	1
were	1
appointed.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
a	1
chosen	1
generation,	1
a	1
royal	1
priesthood,	1
an	1
holy	1
nation,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
people;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
shew	1
forth	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
darkness	1
into	1
his	1
marvellous	1
light;	1
2:10	1
Which	1
in	1
time	1
past	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
people,	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy,	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
obtained	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:11	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
as	1
strangers	1
and	1
pilgrims,	1
abstain	1
from	1
fleshly	1
lusts,	1
which	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
soul;	1
2:12	1
Having	1
your	1
conversation	1
honest	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
against	1
you	1
as	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
by	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
behold,	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
visitation.	1
	1
2:13	1
Submit	1
yourselves	1
to	1
every	1
ordinance	1
of	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake:	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
as	1
supreme;	1
2:14	1
Or	1
unto	1
governors,	1
as	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
2:15	1
For	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
with	1
well	1
doing	1
ye	1
may	1
put	1
to	1
silence	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
foolish	1
men:	1
2:16	1
As	1
free,	1
and	1
not	1
using	1
your	1
liberty	1
for	1
a	1
cloke	1
of	1
maliciousness,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:17	1
Honour	1
all	1
men.	1
Love	1
the	1
brotherhood.	1
Fear	1
God.	1
Honour	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:18	1
Servants,	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
your	1
masters	1
with	1
all	1
fear;	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
gentle,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
froward.	1
	1
2:19	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
thankworthy,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
for	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God	1
endure	1
grief,	1
suffering	1
wrongfully.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
what	1
glory	1
is	1
it,	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
be	1
buffeted	1
for	1
your	1
faults,	1
ye	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
patiently?	1
but	1
if,	1
when	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
suffer	1
for	1
it,	1
ye	1
take	1
it	1
patiently,	1
this	1
is	1
acceptable	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
even	1
hereunto	1
were	1
ye	1
called:	1
because	1
Christ	1
also	1
suffered	1
for	1
us,	1
leaving	1
us	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
follow	1
his	1
steps:	1
2:22	1
Who	1
did	1
no	1
sin,	1
neither	1
was	1
guile	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
mouth:	1
2:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reviled,	1
reviled	1
not	1
again;	1
when	1
he	1
suffered,	1
he	1
threatened	1
not;	1
but	1
committed	1
himself	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
judgeth	1
righteously:	1
2:24	1
Who	1
his	1
own	1
self	1
bare	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
tree,	1
that	1
we,	1
being	1
dead	1
to	1
sins,	1
should	1
live	1
unto	1
righteousness:	1
by	1
whose	1
stripes	1
ye	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
going	1
astray;	1
but	1
are	1
now	1
returned	1
unto	1
the	1
Shepherd	1
and	1
Bishop	1
of	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
3:1	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
wives,	1
be	1
in	1
subjection	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
husbands;	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
word,	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
without	1
the	1
word	1
be	1
won	1
by	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wives;	1
3:2	1
While	1
they	1
behold	1
your	1
chaste	1
conversation	1
coupled	1
with	1
fear.	1
	1
3:3	1
Whose	1
adorning	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
outward	1
adorning	1
of	1
plaiting	1
the	1
hair,	1
and	1
of	1
wearing	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
of	1
putting	1
on	1
of	1
apparel;	1
3:4	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
hidden	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
corruptible,	1
even	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
a	1
meek	1
and	1
quiet	1
spirit,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
great	1
price.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
after	1
this	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
time	1
the	1
holy	1
women	1
also,	1
who	1
trusted	1
in	1
God,	1
adorned	1
themselves,	1
being	1
in	1
subjection	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
husbands:	1
3:6	1
Even	1
as	1
Sara	1
obeyed	1
Abraham,	1
calling	1
him	1
lord:	1
whose	1
daughters	1
ye	1
are,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
ye	1
do	1
well,	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
with	1
any	1
amazement.	1
	1
3:7	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
husbands,	1
dwell	1
with	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge,	1
giving	1
honour	1
unto	1
the	1
wife,	1
as	1
unto	1
the	1
weaker	1
vessel,	1
and	1
as	1
being	1
heirs	1
together	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
life;	1
that	1
your	1
prayers	1
be	1
not	1
hindered.	1
	1
3:8	1
Finally,	1
be	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
having	1
compassion	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
love	1
as	1
brethren,	1
be	1
pitiful,	1
be	1
courteous:	1
3:9	1
Not	1
rendering	1
evil	1
for	1
evil,	1
or	1
railing	1
for	1
railing:	1
but	1
contrariwise	1
blessing;	1
knowing	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
thereunto	1
called,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
inherit	1
a	1
blessing.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
love	1
life,	1
and	1
see	1
good	1
days,	1
let	1
him	1
refrain	1
his	1
tongue	1
from	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
no	1
guile:	1
3:11	1
Let	1
him	1
eschew	1
evil,	1
and	1
do	1
good;	1
let	1
him	1
seek	1
peace,	1
and	1
ensue	1
it.	1
	1
3:12	1
For	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
are	1
over	1
the	1
righteous,	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
open	1
unto	1
their	1
prayers:	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
against	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
will	1
harm	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
followers	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good?	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
their	1
terror,	1
neither	1
be	1
troubled;	1
3:15	1
But	1
sanctify	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
always	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
you	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
with	1
meekness	1
and	1
fear:	1
3:16	1
Having	1
a	1
good	1
conscience;	1
that,	1
whereas	1
they	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
of	1
evildoers,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
ashamed	1
that	1
falsely	1
accuse	1
your	1
good	1
conversation	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
better,	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
be	1
so,	1
that	1
ye	1
suffer	1
for	1
well	1
doing,	1
than	1
for	1
evil	1
doing.	1
	1
3:18	1
For	1
Christ	1
also	1
hath	1
once	1
suffered	1
for	1
sins,	1
the	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
unjust,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
us	1
to	1
God,	1
being	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
quickened	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit:	1
3:19	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
the	1
spirits	1
in	1
prison;	1
3:20	1
Which	1
sometime	1
were	1
disobedient,	1
when	1
once	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
God	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noah,	1
while	1
the	1
ark	1
was	1
a	1
preparing,	1
wherein	1
few,	1
that	1
is,	1
eight	1
souls	1
were	1
saved	1
by	1
water.	1
	1
3:21	1
The	1
like	1
figure	1
whereunto	1
even	1
baptism	1
doth	1
also	1
now	1
save	1
us	1
(not	1
the	1
putting	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
conscience	1
toward	1
God,)	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
3:22	1
Who	1
is	1
gone	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God;	1
angels	1
and	1
authorities	1
and	1
powers	1
being	1
made	1
subject	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
Christ	1
hath	1
suffered	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
arm	1
yourselves	1
likewise	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
mind:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
suffered	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
hath	1
ceased	1
from	1
sin;	1
4:2	1
That	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
should	1
live	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
to	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
past	1
of	1
our	1
life	1
may	1
suffice	1
us	1
to	1
have	1
wrought	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
when	1
we	1
walked	1
in	1
lasciviousness,	1
lusts,	1
excess	1
of	1
wine,	1
revellings,	1
banquetings,	1
and	1
abominable	1
idolatries:	1
4:4	1
Wherein	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
strange	1
that	1
ye	1
run	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
excess	1
of	1
riot,	1
speaking	1
evil	1
of	1
you:	1
4:5	1
Who	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
quick	1
and	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
was	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
live	1
according	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
spirit.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
sober,	1
and	1
watch	1
unto	1
prayer.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
have	1
fervent	1
charity	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
charity	1
shall	1
cover	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
4:9	1
Use	1
hospitality	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
without	1
grudging.	1
	1
4:10	1
As	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
received	1
the	1
gift,	1
even	1
so	1
minister	1
the	1
same	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
good	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
manifold	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:11	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak,	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
as	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God;	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
minister,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ability	1
which	1
God	1
giveth:	1
that	1
God	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
praise	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
4:12	1
Beloved,	1
think	1
it	1
not	1
strange	1
concerning	1
the	1
fiery	1
trial	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
try	1
you,	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
strange	1
thing	1
happened	1
unto	1
you:	1
4:13	1
But	1
rejoice,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
partakers	1
of	1
Christ's	1
sufferings;	1
that,	1
when	1
his	1
glory	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed,	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
glad	1
also	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy.	1
	1
4:14	1
If	1
ye	1
be	1
reproached	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Christ,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
glory	1
and	1
of	1
God	1
resteth	1
upon	1
you:	1
on	1
their	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of,	1
but	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
glorified.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
murderer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
or	1
as	1
an	1
evildoer,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
busybody	1
in	1
other	1
men's	1
matters.	1
	1
4:16	1
Yet	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
suffer	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
glorify	1
God	1
on	1
this	1
behalf.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
that	1
judgment	1
must	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
first	1
begin	1
at	1
us,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
be	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
not	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
righteous	1
scarcely	1
be	1
saved,	1
where	1
shall	1
the	1
ungodly	1
and	1
the	1
sinner	1
appear?	1
	1
4:19	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
suffer	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
commit	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
their	1
souls	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
well	1
doing,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
faithful	1
Creator.	1
	1
5:1	1
The	1
elders	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
you	1
I	1
exhort,	1
who	1
am	1
also	1
an	1
elder,	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
partaker	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed:	1
5:2	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
taking	1
the	1
oversight	1
thereof,	1
not	1
by	1
constraint,	1
but	1
willingly;	1
not	1
for	1
filthy	1
lucre,	1
but	1
of	1
a	1
ready	1
mind;	1
5:3	1
Neither	1
as	1
being	1
lords	1
over	1
God's	1
heritage,	1
but	1
being	1
ensamples	1
to	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
Shepherd	1
shall	1
appear,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
glory	1
that	1
fadeth	1
not	1
away.	1
	1
5:5	1
Likewise,	1
ye	1
younger,	1
submit	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
elder.	1
Yea,	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
subject	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
humility:	1
for	1
God	1
resisteth	1
the	1
proud,	1
and	1
giveth	1
grace	1
to	1
the	1
humble.	1
	1
5:6	1
Humble	1
yourselves	1
therefore	1
under	1
the	1
mighty	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
exalt	1
you	1
in	1
due	1
time:	1
5:7	1
Casting	1
all	1
your	1
care	1
upon	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
careth	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
5:8	1
Be	1
sober,	1
be	1
vigilant;	1
because	1
your	1
adversary	1
the	1
devil,	1
as	1
a	1
roaring	1
lion,	1
walketh	1
about,	1
seeking	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
devour:	1
5:9	1
Whom	1
resist	1
stedfast	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
afflictions	1
are	1
accomplished	1
in	1
your	1
brethren	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:10	1
But	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
all	1
grace,	1
who	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
unto	1
his	1
eternal	1
glory	1
by	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
after	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
suffered	1
a	1
while,	1
make	1
you	1
perfect,	1
stablish,	1
strengthen,	1
settle	1
you.	1
	1
5:11	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
dominion	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
5:12	1
By	1
Silvanus,	1
a	1
faithful	1
brother	1
unto	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
suppose,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
briefly,	1
exhorting,	1
and	1
testifying	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand.	1
	1
5:13	1
The	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
Babylon,	1
elected	1
together	1
with	1
you,	1
saluteth	1
you;	1
and	1
so	1
doth	1
Marcus	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
5:14	1
Greet	1
ye	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
charity.	1
Peace	1
be	1

Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Peter	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
a	1
servant	1
and	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
obtained	1
like	1
precious	1
faith	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
our	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:2	1
Grace	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord,	1
1:3	1
According	1
as	1
his	1
divine	1
power	1
hath	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
unto	1
life	1
and	1
godliness,	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
glory	1
and	1
virtue:	1
1:4	1
Whereby	1
are	1
given	1
unto	1
us	1
exceeding	1
great	1
and	1
precious	1
promises:	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
nature,	1
having	1
escaped	1
the	1
corruption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
lust.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
beside	1
this,	1
giving	1
all	1
diligence,	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
virtue;	1
and	1
to	1
virtue	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
And	1
to	1
knowledge	1
temperance;	1
and	1
to	1
temperance	1
patience;	1
and	1
to	1
patience	1
godliness;	1
1:7	1
And	1
to	1
godliness	1
brotherly	1
kindness;	1
and	1
to	1
brotherly	1
kindness	1
charity.	1
	1
1:8	1
For	1
if	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
abound,	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
be	1
barren	1
nor	1
unfruitful	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
lacketh	1
these	1
things	1
is	1
blind,	1
and	1
cannot	1
see	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
purged	1
from	1
his	1
old	1
sins.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
rather,	1
brethren,	1
give	1
diligence	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
calling	1
and	1
election	1
sure:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
ye	1
shall	1
never	1
fall:	1
1:11	1
For	1
so	1
an	1
entrance	1
shall	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto	1
you	1
abundantly	1
into	1
the	1
everlasting	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:12	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
negligent	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
though	1
ye	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
truth.	1
	1
1:13	1
Yea,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
meet,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
tabernacle,	1
to	1
stir	1
you	1
up	1
by	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance;	1
1:14	1
Knowing	1
that	1
shortly	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
off	1
this	1
my	1
tabernacle,	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me.	1
	1
1:15	1
Moreover	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
after	1
my	1
decease	1
to	1
have	1
these	1
things	1
always	1
in	1
remembrance.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
followed	1
cunningly	1
devised	1
fables,	1
when	1
we	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
were	1
eyewitnesses	1
of	1
his	1
majesty.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
received	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
honour	1
and	1
glory,	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
such	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
excellent	1
glory,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
this	1
voice	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
heaven	1
we	1
heard,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
mount.	1
	1
1:19	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
a	1
more	1
sure	1
word	1
of	1
prophecy;	1
whereunto	1
ye	1
do	1
well	1
that	1
ye	1
take	1
heed,	1
as	1
unto	1
a	1
light	1
that	1
shineth	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
place,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
dawn,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
star	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts:	1
1:20	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
no	1
prophecy	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
private	1
interpretation.	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
the	1
prophecy	1
came	1
not	1
in	1
old	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man:	1
but	1
holy	1
men	1
of	1
God	1
spake	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:1	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
false	1
prophets	1
also	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
even	1
as	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
false	1
teachers	1
among	1
you,	1
who	1
privily	1
shall	1
bring	1
in	1
damnable	1
heresies,	1
even	1
denying	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
upon	1
themselves	1
swift	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
many	1
shall	1
follow	1
their	1
pernicious	1
ways;	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
truth	1
shall	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
through	1
covetousness	1
shall	1
they	1
with	1
feigned	1
words	1
make	1
merchandise	1
of	1
you:	1
whose	1
judgment	1
now	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
lingereth	1
not,	1
and	1
their	1
damnation	1
slumbereth	1
not.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
that	1
sinned,	1
but	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
to	1
hell,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
into	1
chains	1
of	1
darkness,	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
judgment;	1
2:5	1
And	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
world,	1
but	1
saved	1
Noah	1
the	1
eighth	1
person,	1
a	1
preacher	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
flood	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
ungodly;	1
2:6	1
And	1
turning	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
into	1
ashes	1
condemned	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
overthrow,	1
making	1
them	1
an	1
ensample	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
after	1
should	1
live	1
ungodly;	1
2:7	1
And	1
delivered	1
just	1
Lot,	1
vexed	1
with	1
the	1
filthy	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
wicked:	1
2:8	1
(For	1
that	1
righteous	1
man	1
dwelling	1
among	1
them,	1
in	1
seeing	1
and	1
hearing,	1
vexed	1
his	1
righteous	1
soul	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
with	1
their	1
unlawful	1
deeds;)	1
2:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
how	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
godly	1
out	1
of	1
temptations,	1
and	1
to	1
reserve	1
the	1
unjust	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
to	1
be	1
punished:	1
2:10	1
But	1
chiefly	1
them	1
that	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
uncleanness,	1
and	1
despise	1
government.	1
Presumptuous	1
are	1
they,	1
selfwilled,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
afraid	1
to	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
2:11	1
Whereas	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
greater	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
might,	1
bring	1
not	1
railing	1
accusation	1
against	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
these,	1
as	1
natural	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
understand	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
utterly	1
perish	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
corruption;	1
2:13	1
And	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
unrighteousness,	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
count	1
it	1
pleasure	1
to	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time.	1
Spots	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
blemishes,	1
sporting	1
themselves	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
deceivings	1
while	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you;	1
2:14	1
Having	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
adultery,	1
and	1
that	1
cannot	1
cease	1
from	1
sin;	1
beguiling	1
unstable	1
souls:	1
an	1
heart	1
they	1
have	1
exercised	1
with	1
covetous	1
practices;	1
cursed	1
children:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
have	1
forsaken	1
the	1
right	1
way,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
astray,	1
following	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bosor,	1
who	1
loved	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
2:16	1
But	1
was	1
rebuked	1
for	1
his	1
iniquity:	1
the	1
dumb	1
ass	1
speaking	1
with	1
man's	1
voice	1
forbad	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
2:17	1
These	1
are	1
wells	1
without	1
water,	1
clouds	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
with	1
a	1
tempest;	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
darkness	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
speak	1
great	1
swelling	1
words	1
of	1
vanity,	1
they	1
allure	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
through	1
much	1
wantonness,	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
clean	1
escaped	1
from	1
them	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
error.	1
	1
2:19	1
While	1
they	1
promise	1
them	1
liberty,	1
they	1
themselves	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
corruption:	1
for	1
of	1
whom	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
overcome,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
bondage.	1
	1
2:20	1
For	1
if	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
pollutions	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
are	1
again	1
entangled	1
therein,	1
and	1
overcome,	1
the	1
latter	1
end	1
is	1
worse	1
with	1
them	1
than	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:21	1
For	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
than,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
to	1
turn	1
from	1
the	1
holy	1
commandment	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
proverb,	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
vomit	1
again;	1
and	1
the	1
sow	1
that	1
was	1
washed	1
to	1
her	1
wallowing	1
in	1
the	1
mire.	1
	1
3:1	1
This	1
second	1
epistle,	1
beloved,	1
I	1
now	1
write	1
unto	1
you;	1
in	1
both	1
which	1
I	1
stir	1
up	1
your	1
pure	1
minds	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
remembrance:	1
3:2	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
mindful	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour:	1
3:3	1
Knowing	1
this	1
first,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
scoffers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts,	1
3:4	1
And	1
saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
for	1
since	1
the	1
fathers	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
all	1
things	1
continue	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation.	1
	1
3:5	1
For	1
this	1
they	1
willingly	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
standing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
water:	1
3:6	1
Whereby	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
then	1
was,	1
being	1
overflowed	1
with	1
water,	1
perished:	1
3:7	1
But	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
are	1
now,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
word	1
are	1
kept	1
in	1
store,	1
reserved	1
unto	1
fire	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment	1
and	1
perdition	1
of	1
ungodly	1
men.	1
	1
3:8	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
be	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Lord	1
as	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
as	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:9	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
not	1
slack	1
concerning	1
his	1
promise,	1
as	1
some	1
men	1
count	1
slackness;	1
but	1
is	1
longsuffering	1
to	1
us-ward,	1
not	1
willing	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
perish,	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
3:10	1
But	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
pass	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat,	1
the	1
earth	1
also	1
and	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
are	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
up.	1
	1
3:11	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
persons	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
holy	1
conversation	1
and	1
godliness,	1
3:12	1
Looking	1
for	1
and	1
hasting	1
unto	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
God,	1
wherein	1
the	1
heavens	1
being	1
on	1
fire	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
elements	1
shall	1
melt	1
with	1
fervent	1
heat?	1
	1
3:13	1
Nevertheless	1
we,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise,	1
look	1
for	1
new	1
heavens	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth,	1
wherein	1
dwelleth	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:14	1
Wherefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
that	1
ye	1
look	1
for	1
such	1
things,	1
be	1
diligent	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
peace,	1
without	1
spot,	1
and	1
blameless.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
account	1
that	1
the	1
longsuffering	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
is	1
salvation;	1
even	1
as	1
our	1
beloved	1
brother	1
Paul	1
also	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
hath	1
written	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:16	1
As	1
also	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
epistles,	1
speaking	1
in	1
them	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
in	1
which	1
are	1
some	1
things	1
hard	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned	1
and	1
unstable	1
wrest,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
scriptures,	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
destruction.	1
	1
3:17	1
Ye	1
therefore,	1
beloved,	1
seeing	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things	1
before,	1
beware	1
lest	1
ye	1
also,	1
being	1
led	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
fall	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
stedfastness.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
grow	1
in	1
grace,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
Saviour	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
To	1
him	1
be	1
glory	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
That	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
our	1
eyes,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
looked	1
upon,	1
and	1
our	1
hands	1
have	1
handled,	1
of	1
the	1
Word	1
of	1
life;	1
1:2	1
(For	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
manifested,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
it,	1
and	1
bear	1
witness,	1
and	1
shew	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
eternal	1
life,	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
was	1
manifested	1
unto	1
us;)	1
1:3	1
That	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
declare	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
may	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
us:	1
and	1
truly	1
our	1
fellowship	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
we	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:5	1
This	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
declare	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
light,	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
darkness	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
1:6	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
we	1
lie,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
truth:	1
1:7	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
we	1
have	1
fellowship	1
one	1
with	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
his	1
Son	1
cleanseth	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
sin.	1
	1
1:8	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
sin,	1
we	1
deceive	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
1:9	1
If	1
we	1
confess	1
our	1
sins,	1
he	1
is	1
faithful	1
and	1
just	1
to	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
cleanse	1
us	1
from	1
all	1
unrighteousness.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
sinned,	1
we	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
his	1
word	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
2:1	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
these	1
things	1
write	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
sin	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
sin,	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
advocate	1
with	1
the	1
Father,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
the	1
righteous:	1
2:2	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins:	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
our's	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
him,	1
if	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
2:4	1
He	1
that	1
saith,	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
not	1
his	1
commandments,	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
whoso	1
keepeth	1
his	1
word,	1
in	1
him	1
verily	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
perfected:	1
hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:6	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
ought	1
himself	1
also	1
so	1
to	1
walk,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
	1
2:7	1
Brethren,	1
I	1
write	1
no	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
an	1
old	1
commandment	1
which	1
ye	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
The	1
old	1
commandment	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
2:8	1
Again,	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
thing	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
you:	1
because	1
the	1
darkness	1
is	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
light	1
now	1
shineth.	1
	1
2:9	1
He	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
is	1
in	1
darkness	1
even	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:10	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
occasion	1
of	1
stumbling	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth,	1
because	1
that	1
darkness	1
hath	1
blinded	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
your	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
you	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
2:13	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
little	1
children,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:14	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
fathers,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you,	1
young	1
men,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
wicked	1
one.	1
	1
2:15	1
Love	1
not	1
the	1
world,	1
neither	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
life,	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
the	1
world	1
passeth	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
lust	1
thereof:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:18	1
Little	1
children,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time:	1
and	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
antichrist	1
shall	1
come,	1
even	1
now	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
antichrists;	1
whereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
	1
2:19	1
They	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
us;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
us:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
an	1
unction	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
One,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
lie	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
2:22	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
liar	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ?	1
He	1
is	1
antichrist,	1
that	1
denieth	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
2:23	1
Whosoever	1
denieth	1
the	1
Son,	1
the	1
same	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Father:	1
he	1
that	1
acknowledgeth	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
the	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
2:24	1
Let	1
that	1
therefore	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
If	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
promised	1
us,	1
even	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
2:26	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
concerning	1
them	1
that	1
seduce	1
you.	1
	1
2:27	1
But	1
the	1
anointing	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
him	1
abideth	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
need	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
teach	1
you:	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
anointing	1
teacheth	1
you	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
is	1
truth,	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
lie,	1
and	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
taught	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
now,	1
little	1
children,	1
abide	1
in	1
him;	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
confidence,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
before	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
2:29	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
righteous,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God:	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
knoweth	1
us	1
not,	1
because	1
it	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
3:2	1
Beloved,	1
now	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
doth	1
not	1
yet	1
appear	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
be:	1
but	1
we	1
know	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
appear,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
him;	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
this	1
hope	1
in	1
him	1
purifieth	1
himself,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
pure.	1
	1
3:4	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
transgresseth	1
also	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
manifested	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
our	1
sins;	1
and	1
in	1
him	1
is	1
no	1
sin.	1
	1
3:6	1
Whosoever	1
abideth	1
in	1
him	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
whosoever	1
sinneth	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
him,	1
neither	1
known	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
Little	1
children,	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
righteousness	1
is	1
righteous,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:8	1
He	1
that	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
sinneth	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
For	1
this	1
purpose	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
manifested,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
destroy	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
3:9	1
Whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
doth	1
not	1
commit	1
sin;	1
for	1
his	1
seed	1
remaineth	1
in	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
cannot	1
sin,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
this	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
manifest,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
devil:	1
whosoever	1
doeth	1
not	1
righteousness	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
message	1
that	1
ye	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
3:12	1
Not	1
as	1
Cain,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
slew	1
his	1
brother.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
slew	1
he	1
him?	1
Because	1
his	1
own	1
works	1
were	1
evil,	1
and	1
his	1
brother's	1
righteous.	1
	1
3:13	1
Marvel	1
not,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life,	1
because	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
brethren.	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
abideth	1
in	1
death.	1
	1
3:15	1
Whosoever	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
murderer:	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
murderer	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life	1
abiding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
Hereby	1
perceive	1
we	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
our	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
3:17	1
But	1
whoso	1
hath	1
this	1
world's	1
good,	1
and	1
seeth	1
his	1
brother	1
have	1
need,	1
and	1
shutteth	1
up	1
his	1
bowels	1
of	1
compassion	1
from	1
him,	1
how	1
dwelleth	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
him?	1
	1
3:18	1
My	1
little	1
children,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
love	1
in	1
word,	1
neither	1
in	1
tongue;	1
but	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
shall	1
assure	1
our	1
hearts	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us,	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
heart,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
3:21	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
our	1
heart	1
condemn	1
us	1
not,	1
then	1
have	1
we	1
confidence	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
receive	1
of	1
him,	1
because	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
pleasing	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
his	1
commandment,	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
us	1
commandment.	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
his	1
commandments	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
hereby	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
abideth	1
in	1
us,	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us.	1
	1
4:1	1
Beloved,	1
believe	1
not	1
every	1
spirit,	1
but	1
try	1
the	1
spirits	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
because	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:2	1
Hereby	1
know	1
ye	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
Every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
4:3	1
And	1
every	1
spirit	1
that	1
confesseth	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
antichrist,	1
whereof	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come;	1
and	1
even	1
now	1
already	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:4	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
have	1
overcome	1
them:	1
because	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:5	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
therefore	1
speak	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
heareth	1
them.	1
	1
4:6	1
We	1
are	1
of	1
God:	1
he	1
that	1
knoweth	1
God	1
heareth	1
us;	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
us.	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
error.	1
	1
4:7	1
Beloved,	1
let	1
us	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
knoweth	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
knoweth	1
not	1
God;	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
love.	1
	1
4:9	1
In	1
this	1
was	1
manifested	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
toward	1
us,	1
because	1
that	1
God	1
sent	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
live	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
4:10	1
Herein	1
is	1
love,	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
loved	1
God,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
propitiation	1
for	1
our	1
sins.	1
	1
4:11	1
Beloved,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
us,	1
we	1
ought	1
also	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
4:12	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
If	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
his	1
love	1
is	1
perfected	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
4:13	1
Hereby	1
know	1
we	1
that	1
we	1
dwell	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
us,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
Spirit.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
do	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
sent	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:15	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
and	1
believed	1
the	1
love	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
to	1
us.	1
God	1
is	1
love;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
love	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
Herein	1
is	1
our	1
love	1
made	1
perfect,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
boldness	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment:	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
so	1
are	1
we	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
4:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
perfect	1
love	1
casteth	1
out	1
fear:	1
because	1
fear	1
hath	1
torment.	1
He	1
that	1
feareth	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
love.	1
	1
4:19	1
We	1
love	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
4:20	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
say,	1
I	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
hateth	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
not	1
his	1
brother	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
seen,	1
how	1
can	1
he	1
love	1
God	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
seen?	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
this	1
commandment	1
have	1
we	1
from	1
him,	1
That	1
he	1
who	1
loveth	1
God	1
love	1
his	1
brother	1
also.	1
	1
5:1	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
loveth	1
him	1
that	1
begat	1
loveth	1
him	1
also	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:2	1
By	1
this	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
when	1
we	1
love	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments:	1
and	1
his	1
commandments	1
are	1
not	1
grievous.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
5:5	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
5:6	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood,	1
even	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
not	1
by	1
water	1
only,	1
but	1
by	1
water	1
and	1
blood.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness,	1
because	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
record	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
Father,	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
in	1
earth,	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
blood:	1
and	1
these	1
three	1
agree	1
in	1
one.	1
	1
5:9	1
If	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
men,	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
testified	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:10	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
the	1
witness	1
in	1
himself:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
liar;	1
because	1
he	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
record	1
that	1
God	1
gave	1
of	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
Son.	1
	1
5:12	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
life.	1
	1
5:13	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
confidence	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
him,	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
heareth	1
us:	1
5:15	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
hear	1
us,	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
ask,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
petitions	1
that	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
5:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
his	1
brother	1
sin	1
a	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
he	1
shall	1
ask,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
life	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
unto	1
death:	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
pray	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
5:17	1
All	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
sin:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sin	1
not	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
5:18	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
whosoever	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
God	1
sinneth	1
not;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
begotten	1
of	1
God	1
keepeth	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
wicked	1
one	1
toucheth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
lieth	1
in	1
wickedness.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
us	1
an	1
understanding,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
Little	1
children,	1
keep	1
yourselves	1
from	1
idols.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Second	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
elect	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
children,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
not	1
I	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
truth;	1
1:2	1
For	1
the	1
truth's	1
sake,	1
which	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
us,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
love.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
of	1
thy	1
children	1
walking	1
in	1
truth,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
commandment	1
from	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
lady,	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
wrote	1
a	1
new	1
commandment	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
that	1
we	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
love,	1
that	1
we	1
walk	1
after	1
his	1
commandments.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
commandment,	1
That,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
ye	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
1:7	1
For	1
many	1
deceivers	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
who	1
confess	1
not	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
flesh.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
deceiver	1
and	1
an	1
antichrist.	1
	1
1:8	1
Look	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
wrought,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
receive	1
a	1
full	1
reward.	1
	1
1:9	1
Whosoever	1
transgresseth,	1
and	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
not	1
God.	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
hath	1
both	1
the	1
Father	1
and	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
1:10	1
If	1
there	1
come	1
any	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
bring	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
receive	1
him	1
not	1
into	1
your	1
house,	1
neither	1
bid	1
him	1
God	1
speed:	1
1:11	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
biddeth	1
him	1
God	1
speed	1
is	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
evil	1
deeds.	1
	1
1:12	1
Having	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
write	1
with	1
paper	1
and	1
ink:	1
but	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
that	1
our	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
1:13	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
elect	1
sister	1
greet	1
thee.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Third	1
Epistle	1
General	1
of	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
elder	1
unto	1
the	1
wellbeloved	1
Gaius,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:2	1
Beloved,	1
I	1
wish	1
above	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
prosper	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
health,	1
even	1
as	1
thy	1
soul	1
prospereth.	1
	1
1:3	1
For	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
greatly,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
came	1
and	1
testified	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
walkest	1
in	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
greater	1
joy	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
walk	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Beloved,	1
thou	1
doest	1
faithfully	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
doest	1
to	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
to	1
strangers;	1
1:6	1
Which	1
have	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
thy	1
charity	1
before	1
the	1
church:	1
whom	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
forward	1
on	1
their	1
journey	1
after	1
a	1
godly	1
sort,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
well:	1
1:7	1
Because	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
name's	1
sake	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
taking	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:8	1
We	1
therefore	1
ought	1
to	1
receive	1
such,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
fellowhelpers	1
to	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
1:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
Diotrephes,	1
who	1
loveth	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence	1
among	1
them,	1
receiveth	1
us	1
not.	1
	1
1:10	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
I	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
remember	1
his	1
deeds	1
which	1
he	1
doeth,	1
prating	1
against	1
us	1
with	1
malicious	1
words:	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
therewith,	1
neither	1
doth	1
he	1
himself	1
receive	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
forbiddeth	1
them	1
that	1
would,	1
and	1
casteth	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
1:11	1
Beloved,	1
follow	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
He	1
that	1
doeth	1
good	1
is	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hath	1
not	1
seen	1
God.	1
	1
1:12	1
Demetrius	1
hath	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
itself:	1
yea,	1
and	1
we	1
also	1
bear	1
record;	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
our	1
record	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
1:13	1
I	1
had	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
write,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
with	1
ink	1
and	1
pen	1
write	1
unto	1
thee:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
shall	1
shortly	1
see	1
thee,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
speak	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
thee.	1
Our	1
friends	1
salute	1
thee.	1
Greet	1
the	1
friends	1
by	1
name.	1

The	1
General	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Jude	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Jude,	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
God	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
preserved	1
in	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
called:	1
1:2	1
Mercy	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
love,	1
be	1
multiplied.	1
	1
1:3	1
Beloved,	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
all	1
diligence	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
salvation,	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
exhort	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
earnestly	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
was	1
once	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
1:4	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
men	1
crept	1
in	1
unawares,	1
who	1
were	1
before	1
of	1
old	1
ordained	1
to	1
this	1
condemnation,	1
ungodly	1
men,	1
turning	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
into	1
lasciviousness,	1
and	1
denying	1
the	1
only	1
Lord	1
God,	1
and	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
remembrance,	1
though	1
ye	1
once	1
knew	1
this,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Lord,	1
having	1
saved	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
afterward	1
destroyed	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
kept	1
not	1
their	1
first	1
estate,	1
but	1
left	1
their	1
own	1
habitation,	1
he	1
hath	1
reserved	1
in	1
everlasting	1
chains	1
under	1
darkness	1
unto	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
day.	1
	1
1:7	1
Even	1
as	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
about	1
them	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
giving	1
themselves	1
over	1
to	1
fornication,	1
and	1
going	1
after	1
strange	1
flesh,	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
for	1
an	1
example,	1
suffering	1
the	1
vengeance	1
of	1
eternal	1
fire.	1
	1
1:8	1
Likewise	1
also	1
these	1
filthy	1
dreamers	1
defile	1
the	1
flesh,	1
despise	1
dominion,	1
and	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
dignities.	1
	1
1:9	1
Yet	1
Michael	1
the	1
archangel,	1
when	1
contending	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
he	1
disputed	1
about	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Moses,	1
durst	1
not	1
bring	1
against	1
him	1
a	1
railing	1
accusation,	1
but	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
rebuke	1
thee.	1
	1
1:10	1
But	1
these	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
know	1
not:	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
know	1
naturally,	1
as	1
brute	1
beasts,	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
they	1
corrupt	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:11	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
Cain,	1
and	1
ran	1
greedily	1
after	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
Balaam	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
gainsaying	1
of	1
Core.	1
	1
1:12	1
These	1
are	1
spots	1
in	1
your	1
feasts	1
of	1
charity,	1
when	1
they	1
feast	1
with	1
you,	1
feeding	1
themselves	1
without	1
fear:	1
clouds	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
water,	1
carried	1
about	1
of	1
winds;	1
trees	1
whose	1
fruit	1
withereth,	1
without	1
fruit,	1
twice	1
dead,	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots;	1
1:13	1
Raging	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
foaming	1
out	1
their	1
own	1
shame;	1
wandering	1
stars,	1
to	1
whom	1
is	1
reserved	1
the	1
blackness	1
of	1
darkness	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
Enoch	1
also,	1
the	1
seventh	1
from	1
Adam,	1
prophesied	1
of	1
these,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
cometh	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
saints,	1
1:15	1
To	1
execute	1
judgment	1
upon	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
convince	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
ungodly	1
among	1
them	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
ungodly	1
deeds	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
ungodly	1
committed,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
hard	1
speeches	1
which	1
ungodly	1
sinners	1
have	1
spoken	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
1:16	1
These	1
are	1
murmurers,	1
complainers,	1
walking	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
lusts;	1
and	1
their	1
mouth	1
speaketh	1
great	1
swelling	1
words,	1
having	1
men's	1
persons	1
in	1
admiration	1
because	1
of	1
advantage.	1
	1
1:17	1
But,	1
beloved,	1
remember	1
ye	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:18	1
How	1
that	1
they	1
told	1
you	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
mockers	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
who	1
should	1
walk	1
after	1
their	1
own	1
ungodly	1
lusts.	1
	1
1:19	1
These	1
be	1
they	1
who	1
separate	1
themselves,	1
sensual,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
ye,	1
beloved,	1
building	1
up	1
yourselves	1
on	1
your	1
most	1
holy	1
faith,	1
praying	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
1:21	1
Keep	1
yourselves	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
of	1
some	1
have	1
compassion,	1
making	1
a	1
difference:	1
1:23	1
And	1
others	1
save	1
with	1
fear,	1
pulling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire;	1
hating	1
even	1
the	1
garment	1
spotted	1
by	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
1:24	1
Now	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you	1
from	1
falling,	1
and	1
to	1
present	1
you	1
faultless	1
before	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
with	1
exceeding	1
joy,	1
1:25	1
To	1
the	1
only	1
wise	1
God	1
our	1
Saviour,	1
be	1
glory	1
and	1
majesty,	1
dominion	1
and	1
power,	1
both	1
now	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1

The	1
Revelation	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
and	1
signified	1
it	1
by	1
his	1
angel	1
unto	1
his	1
servant	1
John:	1
1:2	1
Who	1
bare	1

of	1
the	1

	1
1:4	1
John	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1

Grace	1

and	1
peace,	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
is,	1

which	1

from	1

which	1
are	1
before	1
his	1
throne;	1
1:5	1
And	1
from	1
Jesus	1

who	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
witness,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1

Unto	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us,	1
and	1
washed	1
us	1
from	1
our	1
sins	1
in	1
his	1
own	1

1:6	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
us	1

to	1

ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:7	1
Behold,	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
clouds;	1
and	1
every	1
eye	1
shall	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
pierced	1
him:	1

all	1

of	1
the	1

wail	1

of	1
him.	1
Even	1

I	1

I	1
John,	1
who	1

companion	1
in	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
patience	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
isle	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Patmos,	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:10	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit	1
on	1
the	1
Lord's	1
day,	1
and	1
heard	1
behind	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
voice,	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
1:11	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
and,	1
What	1
thou	1
seest,	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
send	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
churches	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Asia;	1
unto	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
unto	1
Smyrna,	1
and	1
unto	1
Pergamos,	1
and	1
unto	1
Thyatira,	1
and	1
unto	1
Sardis,	1
and	1
unto	1
Philadelphia,	1
and	1
unto	1
Laodicea.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
voice	1
that	1
spake	1
with	1
me.	1
And	1
being	1
turned,	1
I	1
saw	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
1:13	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
one	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
foot,	1
and	1
girt	1
about	1
the	1
paps	1
with	1
a	1
golden	1
girdle.	1
	1
1:14	1
His	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
white	1
like	1
wool,	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire;	1
1:15	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
unto	1
fine	1
brass,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
burned	1
in	1
a	1
furnace;	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
many	1
waters.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
seven	1
stars:	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
a	1
sharp	1
twoedged	1
sword:	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
shineth	1
in	1
his	1
strength.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
dead.	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
upon	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last:	1
1:18	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
that	1
liveth,	1
and	1
was	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I	1
am	1
alive	1
for	1
evermore,	1
Amen;	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
hell	1
and	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
1:19	1
Write	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
hereafter;	1
1:20	1
The	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
in	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks.	1
The	1
seven	1
stars	1
are	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
churches:	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
candlesticks	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
churches.	1
	1
2:1	1
Unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Ephesus	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
who	1
walketh	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
golden	1
candlesticks;	1
2:2	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
thy	1
labour,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
how	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
bear	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
evil:	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
tried	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
apostles,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
hast	1
found	1
them	1
liars:	1
2:3	1
And	1
hast	1
borne,	1
and	1
hast	1
patience,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake	1
hast	1
laboured,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
fainted.	1
	1
2:4	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
thy	1
first	1
love.	1
	1
2:5	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
from	1
whence	1
thou	1
art	1
fallen,	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
do	1
the	1
first	1
works;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
remove	1
thy	1
candlestick	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
except	1
thou	1
repent.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
this	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
thou	1
hatest	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
hate.	1
	1
2:7	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
paradise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Smyrna	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive;	1
2:9	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
poverty,	1
(but	1
thou	1
art	1
rich)	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
are	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan.	1
	1
2:10	1
Fear	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
shalt	1
suffer:	1
behold,	1
the	1
devil	1
shall	1
cast	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
into	1
prison,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
tried;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation	1
ten	1
days:	1
be	1
thou	1
faithful	1
unto	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
2:11	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
hurt	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Pergamos	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
sharp	1
sword	1
with	1
two	1
edges;	1
2:13	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
where	1
thou	1
dwellest,	1
even	1
where	1
Satan's	1
seat	1
is:	1
and	1
thou	1
holdest	1
fast	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
faith,	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
wherein	1
Antipas	1
was	1
my	1
faithful	1
martyr,	1
who	1
was	1
slain	1
among	1
you,	1
where	1
Satan	1
dwelleth.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
there	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Balaam,	1
who	1
taught	1
Balac	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
before	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols,	1
and	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication.	1
	1
2:15	1
So	1
hast	1
thou	1
also	1
them	1
that	1
hold	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Nicolaitanes,	1
which	1
thing	1
I	1
hate.	1
	1
2:16	1
Repent;	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
quickly,	1
and	1
will	1
fight	1
against	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
2:17	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches;	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
hidden	1
manna,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
white	1
stone,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stone	1
a	1
new	1
name	1
written,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
saving	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
it.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Thyatira	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
hath	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
are	1
like	1
fine	1
brass;	1
2:19	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
and	1
charity,	1
and	1
service,	1
and	1
faith,	1
and	1
thy	1
patience,	1
and	1
thy	1
works;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
2:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
against	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
sufferest	1
that	1
woman	1
Jezebel,	1
which	1
calleth	1
herself	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
seduce	1
my	1
servants	1
to	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
things	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
idols.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
space	1
to	1
repent	1
of	1
her	1
fornication;	1
and	1
she	1
repented	1
not.	1
	1
2:22	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
commit	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
into	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
except	1
they	1
repent	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
kill	1
her	1
children	1
with	1
death;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
which	1
searcheth	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
hearts:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
works.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
rest	1
in	1
Thyatira,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
not	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
Satan,	1
as	1
they	1
speak;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
upon	1
you	1
none	1
other	1
burden.	1
	1
2:25	1
But	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
already	1
hold	1
fast	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
my	1
works	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
nations:	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron;	1
as	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
a	1
potter	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
shivers:	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
2:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Sardis	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
seven	1
stars;	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
art	1
dead.	1
	1
3:2	1
Be	1
watchful,	1
and	1
strengthen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
remain,	1
that	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
die:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
thy	1
works	1
perfect	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Remember	1
therefore	1
how	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
hold	1
fast,	1
and	1
repent.	1
If	1
therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
watch,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
on	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
hour	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
upon	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
few	1
names	1
even	1
in	1
Sardis	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
defiled	1
their	1
garments;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
white:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
3:5	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
blot	1
out	1
his	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
his	1
name	1
before	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
angels.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1

what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1

	1
3:7	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
Philadelphia	1
write;	1
These	1
things	1
saith	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
David,	1
he	1
that	1
openeth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shutteth;	1
and	1
shutteth,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
openeth;	1
3:8	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
before	1
thee	1
an	1
open	1
door,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
shut	1
it:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
little	1
strength,	1
and	1
hast	1
kept	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
denied	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
3:9	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
Satan,	1
which	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
Jews,	1
and	1
are	1
not,	1
but	1
do	1
lie;	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
thee.	1
	1
3:10	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
my	1
patience,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
temptation,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
try	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
3:11	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
hold	1
that	1
fast	1
which	1
thou	1
hast,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
take	1
thy	1
crown.	1
	1
3:12	1
Him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
pillar	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
no	1

and	1
I	1

the	1
faithful	1
and	1
true	1
witness,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
God;	1
3:15	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
works,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot:	1
I	1
would	1
thou	1
wert	1
cold	1
or	1
hot.	1
	1
3:16	1
So	1
then	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
lukewarm,	1
and	1
neither	1
cold	1
nor	1
hot,	1
I	1
will	1
spue	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
3:17	1
Because	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
I	1
am	1
rich,	1
and	1
increased	1
with	1
goods,	1
and	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
nothing;	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
wretched,	1
and	1
miserable,	1
and	1
poor,	1
and	1
blind,	1
and	1
naked:	1
3:18	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
to	1
buy	1
of	1
me	1
gold	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
rich;	1
and	1
white	1
raiment,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
clothed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shame	1
of	1
thy	1
nakedness	1
do	1
not	1
appear;	1
and	1
anoint	1
thine	1
eyes	1
with	1
eyesalve,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see.	1
	1
3:19	1
As	1
many	1
as	1
I	1
love,	1
I	1
rebuke	1
and	1
chasten:	1
be	1
zealous	1
therefore,	1
and	1
repent.	1
	1
3:20	1
Behold,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
knock:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
sup	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
3:21	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
overcometh	1
will	1
I	1
grant	1
to	1
sit	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
throne,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
overcame,	1
and	1
am	1
set	1
down	1
with	1
my	1
Father	1
in	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
3:22	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
Spirit	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
4:1	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet	1
talking	1
with	1
me;	1
which	1
said,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
hereafter.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
immediately	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
spirit:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
throne	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
one	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
and	1
a	1
sardine	1
stone:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rainbow	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
in	1
sight	1
like	1
unto	1
an	1
emerald.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
were	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
seats:	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
seats	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
sitting,	1
clothed	1
in	1
white	1
raiment;	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
crowns	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
proceeded	1
lightnings	1
and	1
thunderings	1
and	1
voices:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
like	1
unto	1
crystal:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
were	1
four	1
beasts	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
before	1
and	1
behind.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
like	1
a	1
calf,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
had	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
flying	1
eagle.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
had	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
six	1
wings	1
about	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
eyes	1
within:	1
and	1
they	1
rest	1
not	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
saying,	1
Holy,	1
holy,	1
holy,	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
was,	1
and	1
is,	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
when	1
those	1
beasts	1
give	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
thanks	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
4:10	1
The	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fall	1
down	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
crowns	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
4:11	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
receive	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
power:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
created	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
for	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
they	1
are	1
and	1
were	1
created.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
a	1
book	1
written	1
within	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
backside,	1
sealed	1
with	1
seven	1
seals.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
strong	1
angel	1
proclaiming	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Who	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof?	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
heaven,	1
nor	1
in	1
earth,	1
neither	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
I	1
wept	1
much,	1
because	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
book,	1
neither	1
to	1
look	1
thereon.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Weep	1
not:	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lion	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda,	1
the	1
Root	1
of	1
David,	1
hath	1
prevailed	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
loose	1
the	1
seven	1
seals	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
stood	1
a	1
Lamb	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
slain,	1
having	1
seven	1
horns	1
and	1
seven	1
eyes,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
seven	1
Spirits	1
of	1
God	1
sent	1
forth	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
book,	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
and	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
having	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
harps,	1
and	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
odours,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
a	1
new	1
song,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
worthy	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
seals	1
thereof:	1
for	1
thou	1
wast	1
slain,	1
and	1
hast	1
redeemed	1
us	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
thy	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
nation;	1
5:10	1
And	1
hast	1
made	1
us	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
kings	1
and	1
priests:	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
reign	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
angels	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand,	1
and	1
thousands	1
of	1
thousands;	1
5:12	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Worthy	1
is	1
the	1
Lamb	1
that	1
was	1
slain	1
to	1
receive	1
power,	1
and	1
riches,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
blessing.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
every	1
creature	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
them,	1
heard	1
I	1
saying,	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
power,	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
said,	1
Amen.	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
when	1
the	1
Lamb	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seals,	1
and	1
I	1
heard,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thunder,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
saying,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
bow;	1
and	1
a	1
crown	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
conquering,	1
and	1
to	1
conquer.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
second	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
second	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
another	1
horse	1
that	1
was	1
red:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
thereon	1
to	1
take	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
kill	1
one	1
another:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
sword.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
third	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
third	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
a	1
black	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
balances	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
say,	1
A	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat	1
for	1
a	1
penny,	1
and	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
barley	1
for	1
a	1
penny;	1
and	1
see	1
thou	1
hurt	1
not	1
the	1
oil	1
and	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fourth	1
seal,	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast	1
say,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
pale	1
horse:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
him	1
was	1
Death,	1
and	1
Hell	1
followed	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
over	1
the	1
fourth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
to	1
kill	1
with	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
with	1
death,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
fifth	1
seal,	1
I	1
saw	1
under	1
the	1
altar	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
which	1
they	1
held:	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
How	1
long,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
holy	1
and	1
true,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
judge	1
and	1
avenge	1
our	1
blood	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
white	1
robes	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
rest	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
season,	1
until	1
their	1
fellowservants	1
also	1
and	1
their	1
brethren,	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
killed	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
sixth	1
seal,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
black	1
as	1
sackcloth	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
became	1
as	1
blood;	1
6:13	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
casteth	1
her	1
untimely	1
figs,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
shaken	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
wind.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
heaven	1
departed	1
as	1
a	1
scroll	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
rolled	1
together;	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
island	1
were	1
moved	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
places.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
every	1
bondman,	1
and	1
every	1
free	1
man,	1
hid	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
dens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
6:16	1
And	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
rocks,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
hide	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
6:17	1
For	1
the	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
wrath	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand?	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
four	1
angels	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
holding	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
the	1
wind	1
should	1
not	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
on	1
any	1
tree.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
ascending	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
having	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God:	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
angels,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
hurt	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
7:3	1
Saying,	1
Hurt	1
not	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
the	1
sea,	1
nor	1
the	1
trees,	1
till	1
we	1
have	1
sealed	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
our	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
sealed:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
sealed	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:5	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Juda	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Reuben	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Gad	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:6	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Aser	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Nephthalim	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Manasses	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:7	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Simeon	1
were	1

twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Levi	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Issachar	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:8	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Zabulon	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Joseph	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin	1
were	1
sealed	1
twelve	1
thousand.	1
	1
7:9	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
number,	1
of	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
people,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
clothed	1
with	1
white	1
robes,	1
and	1
palms	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
7:10	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Salvation	1
to	1
our	1
God	1
which	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
angels	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
fell	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
7:12	1
Saying,	1
Amen:	1
Blessing,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
thanksgiving,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
and	1
might,	1
be	1
unto	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
are	1
arrayed	1
in	1
white	1
robes?	1
and	1
whence	1
came	1
they?	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
and	1
have	1
washed	1
their	1
robes,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
7:15	1
Therefore	1
are	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
temple:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
dwell	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
shall	1
hunger	1
no	1
more,	1
neither	1
thirst	1
any	1
more;	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
light	1
on	1
them,	1
nor	1
any	1
heat.	1
	1
7:17	1
For	1
the	1
Lamb	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
shall	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
lead	1
them	1
unto	1
living	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters:	1
and	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
seventh	1
seal,	1
there	1
was	1
silence	1
in	1
heaven	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
stood	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
given	1
seven	1
trumpets.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
altar,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
censer;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
much	1
incense,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offer	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
all	1
saints	1
upon	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
the	1
throne.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
incense,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
ascended	1
up	1
before	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
took	1
the	1
censer,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
trumpets	1
prepared	1
themselves	1
to	1
sound.	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
first	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
followed	1
hail	1
and	1
fire	1
mingled	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
cast	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
trees	1
was	1
burnt	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
green	1
grass	1
was	1
burnt	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
mountain	1
burning	1
with	1
fire	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
became	1
blood;	1
8:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
creatures	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
had	1
life,	1
died;	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
destroyed.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
great	1
star	1
from	1
heaven,	1
burning	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
lamp,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
rivers,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
star	1
is	1
called	1
Wormwood:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
became	1
wormwood;	1
and	1
many	1
men	1
died	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
bitter.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
smitten,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars;	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shone	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
likewise.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
heard	1
an	1
angel	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Woe,	1
woe,	1
woe,	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
angels,	1
which	1
are	1
yet	1
to	1
sound!	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
star	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven	1
unto	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
given	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit;	1
and	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
furnace;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
were	1
darkened	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
pit.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
locusts	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
unto	1
them	1
was	1
given	1
power,	1
as	1
the	1
scorpions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
power.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hurt	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
neither	1
any	1
green	1
thing,	1
neither	1
any	1
tree;	1
but	1
only	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
kill	1
them,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
tormented	1
five	1
months:	1
and	1
their	1
torment	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
torment	1
of	1
a	1
scorpion,	1
when	1
he	1
striketh	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
men	1
seek	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
death	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
the	1
locusts	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
horses	1
prepared	1
unto	1
battle;	1
and	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
were	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
crowns	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
hair	1
as	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
their	1
teeth	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
breastplates,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
breastplates	1
of	1
iron;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
wings	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
chariots	1
of	1
many	1
horses	1
running	1
to	1
battle.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
tails	1
like	1
unto	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
stings	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
and	1
their	1
power	1
was	1
to	1
hurt	1
men	1
five	1
months.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
king	1
over	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
whose	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
is	1
Abaddon,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Greek	1
tongue	1
hath	1
his	1
name	1
Apollyon.	1
	1
9:12	1
One	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
come	1
two	1
woes	1
more	1
hereafter.	1
	1
9:13	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
sounded,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
altar	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
God,	1
9:14	1
Saying	1
to	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
Loose	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
angels	1
were	1
loosed,	1
which	1
were	1
prepared	1
for	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
a	1
year,	1
for	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
thousand:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
thus	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
horses	1
in	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
them,	1
having	1
breastplates	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
of	1
jacinth,	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
and	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
lions;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths	1
issued	1
fire	1
and	1
smoke	1
and	1
brimstone.	1
	1
9:18	1
By	1
these	1
three	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
men	1
killed,	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
brimstone,	1
which	1
issued	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
tails:	1
for	1
their	1
tails	1
were	1
like	1
unto	1
serpents,	1
and	1
had	1
heads,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
do	1
hurt.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
killed	1
by	1
these	1
plagues	1
yet	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
worship	1
devils,	1
and	1
idols	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
brass,	1
and	1
stone,	1
and	1
of	1
wood:	1
which	1
neither	1
can	1
see,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
walk:	1
9:21	1
Neither	1
repented	1
they	1
of	1
their	1
murders,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
sorceries,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
fornication,	1
nor	1
of	1
their	1
thefts.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
mighty	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
cloud:	1
and	1
a	1
rainbow	1
was	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
as	1
pillars	1
of	1
fire:	1
10:2	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
little	1
book	1
open:	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
10:3	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
when	1
a	1
lion	1
roareth:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried,	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
had	1
uttered	1
their	1
voices,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
write:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
up	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
seven	1
thunders	1
uttered,	1
and	1
write	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
heaven,	1
10:6	1
And	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever,	1
who	1
created	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
therein	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
therein,	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
time	1
no	1
longer:	1
10:7	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
sound,	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
finished,	1
as	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
heaven	1
spake	1
unto	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
which	1
is	1
open	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
standeth	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
me	1
the	1
little	1
book.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
it,	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
make	1
thy	1
belly	1
bitter,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
little	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
angel's	1
hand,	1
and	1
ate	1
it	1
up;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
mouth	1
sweet	1
as	1
honey:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
eaten	1
it,	1
my	1
belly	1
was	1
bitter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Thou	1
must	1
prophesy	1
again	1
before	1
many	1
peoples,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
kings.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
reed	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
rod:	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
stood,	1
saying,	1
Rise,	1
and	1
measure	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
therein.	1
	1
11:2	1
But	1
the	1
court	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
temple	1
leave	1
out,	1
and	1
measure	1
it	1
not;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
city	1
shall	1
they	1
tread	1
under	1
foot	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
power	1
unto	1
my	1
two	1
witnesses,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days,	1
clothed	1
in	1
sackcloth.	1
	1
11:4	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
olive	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
candlesticks	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
fire	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
devoureth	1
their	1
enemies:	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
hurt	1
them,	1
he	1
must	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
11:6	1
These	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
shut	1
heaven,	1
that	1
it	1
rain	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
their	1
prophecy:	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
waters	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
blood,	1
and	1
to	1
smite	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
all	1
plagues,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
they	1
will.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
their	1
testimony,	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
ascendeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them,	1
and	1
kill	1
them.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
shall	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
spiritually	1
is	1
called	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Egypt,	1
where	1
also	1
our	1
Lord	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
kindreds	1
and	1
tongues	1
and	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
suffer	1
their	1
dead	1
bodies	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
graves.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
shall	1
send	1
gifts	1
one	1
to	1
another;	1
because	1
these	1
two	1
prophets	1
tormented	1
them	1
that	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
God	1
entered	1
into	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
upon	1
their	1
feet;	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
saw	1
them.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
up	1
hither.	1
And	1
they	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
in	1
a	1
cloud;	1
and	1
their	1
enemies	1
beheld	1
them.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
the	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
fell,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earthquake	1
were	1
slain	1
of	1
men	1
seven	1
thousand:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
gave	1
glory	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:14	1
The	1
second	1
woe	1
is	1
past;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
third	1
woe	1
cometh	1
quickly.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
sounded;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
great	1
voices	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
become	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
our	1
Lord,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
Christ;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders,	1
which	1
sat	1
before	1
God	1
on	1
their	1
seats,	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
11:17	1
Saying,	1
We	1
give	1
thee	1
thanks,	1
O	1
LORD	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
art	1
to	1
come;	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
to	1
thee	1
thy	1
great	1
power,	1
and	1
hast	1
reigned.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
were	1
angry,	1
and	1
thy	1
wrath	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
judged,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
give	1
reward	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
thy	1
name,	1
small	1
and	1
great;	1
and	1
shouldest	1
destroy	1
them	1
which	1
destroy	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
opened	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
temple	1
the	1
ark	1
of	1
his	1
testament:	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
lightnings,	1
and	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunderings,	1
and	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
great	1
hail.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
great	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
a	1
woman	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
under	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
head	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
twelve	1
stars:	1
12:2	1
And	1
she	1
being	1
with	1
child	1
cried,	1
travailing	1
in	1
birth,	1
and	1
pained	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
another	1
wonder	1
in	1
heaven;	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
red	1
dragon,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
seven	1
crowns	1
upon	1
his	1
heads.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
his	1
tail	1
drew	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
delivered,	1
for	1
to	1
devour	1
her	1
child	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
born.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
man	1
child,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
rule	1
all	1
nations	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
her	1
child	1
was	1
caught	1
up	1
unto	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
throne.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
where	1
she	1
hath	1
a	1
place	1
prepared	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
feed	1
her	1
there	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
threescore	1
days.	1
	1
12:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
war	1
in	1
heaven:	1
Michael	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
fought	1
against	1
the	1
dragon;	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
fought	1
and	1
his	1
angels,	1
12:8	1
And	1
prevailed	1
not;	1
neither	1
was	1
their	1
place	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
dragon	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
called	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
which	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
whole	1
world:	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
his	1
angels	1
were	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
saying	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Now	1
is	1
come	1
salvation,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
Christ:	1
for	1
the	1
accuser	1
of	1
our	1
brethren	1
is	1
cast	1
down,	1
which	1
accused	1
them	1
before	1
our	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
they	1
overcame	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
their	1
testimony;	1
and	1
they	1
loved	1
not	1
their	1
lives	1
unto	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
12:12	1
Therefore	1
rejoice,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
them.	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
inhabiters	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sea!	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
come	1
down	1
unto	1
you,	1
having	1
great	1
wrath,	1
because	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
dragon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
unto	1
the	1
earth,	1
he	1
persecuted	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
man	1
child.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
were	1
given	1
two	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
eagle,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
fly	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
her	1
place,	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
nourished	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
times,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
time,	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
serpent.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
the	1
serpent	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
water	1
as	1
a	1
flood	1
after	1
the	1
woman,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
of	1
the	1
flood.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
helped	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
opened	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
swallowed	1
up	1
the	1
flood	1
which	1
the	1
dragon	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
the	1
dragon	1
was	1
wroth	1
with	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
her	1
seed,	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
I	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
beast	1
rise	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
horns	1
ten	1
crowns,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
heads	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
leopard,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
as	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
as	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
lion:	1
and	1
the	1
dragon	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
great	1
authority.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
heads	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
wounded	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
his	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
wondered	1
after	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
dragon	1
which	1
gave	1
power	1
unto	1
the	1
beast:	1
and	1
they	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
beast?	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things	1
and	1
blasphemies;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
continue	1
forty	1
and	1
two	1
months.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
God,	1
to	1
blaspheme	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
his	1
tabernacle,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
to	1
overcome	1
them:	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
over	1
all	1
kindreds,	1
and	1
tongues,	1
and	1
nations.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
slain	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:9	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
ear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
He	1
that	1
leadeth	1
into	1
captivity	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity:	1
he	1
that	1
killeth	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
must	1
be	1
killed	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
I	1
beheld	1
another	1
beast	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
horns	1
like	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
dragon.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
he	1
exerciseth	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
beast	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
causeth	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
dwell	1
therein	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
first	1
beast,	1
whose	1
deadly	1
wound	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
doeth	1
great	1
wonders,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
maketh	1
fire	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
men,	1
13:14	1
And	1
deceiveth	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
those	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
an	1
image	1
to	1
the	1
beast,	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
wound	1
by	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
live.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
that	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
both	1
speak,	1
and	1
cause	1
that	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
would	1
not	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
should	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
he	1
causeth	1
all,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
mark	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
hand,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads:	1
13:17	1
And	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
buy	1
or	1
sell,	1
save	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
mark,	1
or	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
13:18	1
Here	1
is	1
wisdom.	1
Let	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
understanding	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
beast:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
his	1
number	1
is	1
Six	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
six.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
lo,	1
a	1
Lamb	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
mount	1
Sion,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
having	1
his	1
Father's	1
name	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
14:2	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
thunder:	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers	1
harping	1
with	1
their	1
harps:	1
14:3	1
And	1
they	1
sung	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
new	1
song	1
before	1
the	1
throne,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
four	1
beasts,	1
and	1
the	1
elders:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
learn	1
that	1
song	1
but	1
the	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
thousand,	1
which	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
14:4	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
defiled	1
with	1
women;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
virgins.	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
follow	1
the	1
Lamb	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
goeth.	1
These	1
were	1
redeemed	1
from	1
among	1
men,	1
being	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
unto	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
mouth	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
guile:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
fault	1
before	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
everlasting	1
gospel	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
nation,	1
and	1
kindred,	1
and	1
tongue,	1
and	1
people,	1
14:7	1
Saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Fear	1
God,	1
and	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
judgment	1
is	1
come:	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
that	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
another	1
angel,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
because	1
she	1
made	1
all	1
nations	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
followed	1
them,	1
saying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
mark	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
14:10	1
The	1
same	1
shall	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
without	1
mixture	1
into	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
his	1
indignation;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb:	1
14:11	1
And	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
torment	1
ascendeth	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
rest	1
day	1
nor	1
night,	1
who	1
worship	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
receiveth	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
14:12	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
the	1
saints:	1
here	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
henceforth:	1
Yea,	1
saith	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
rest	1
from	1
their	1
labours;	1
and	1
their	1
works	1
do	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
I	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
cloud,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
cloud	1
one	1
sat	1
like	1
unto	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
having	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
golden	1
crown,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
crying	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sickle,	1
and	1
reap:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
come	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
reap;	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
cloud	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
reaped.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
he	1
also	1
having	1
a	1
sharp	1
sickle.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
another	1
angel	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
altar,	1
which	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
fire;	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
cry	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
saying,	1
Thrust	1
in	1
thy	1
sharp	1
sickle,	1
and	1
gather	1
the	1
clusters	1
of	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
her	1
grapes	1
are	1
fully	1
ripe.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
thrust	1
in	1
his	1
sickle	1
into	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
vine	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
great	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
the	1
winepress	1
was	1
trodden	1
without	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
blood	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
winepress,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
horse	1
bridles,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
six	1
hundred	1
furlongs.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
sign	1
in	1
heaven,	1
great	1
and	1
marvellous,	1
seven	1
angels	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
filled	1
up	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
glass	1
mingled	1
with	1
fire:	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
gotten	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
image,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
mark,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
name,	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
glass,	1
having	1
the	1
harps	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
they	1
sing	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
and	1
marvellous	1
are	1
thy	1
works,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty;	1
just	1
and	1
true	1
are	1
thy	1
ways,	1
thou	1
King	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
15:4	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
fear	1
thee,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
and	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name?	1
for	1
thou	1
only	1
art	1
holy:	1
for	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
before	1
thee;	1
for	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
made	1
manifest.	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
the	1
testimony	1
in	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened:	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
having	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues,	1
clothed	1
in	1
pure	1
and	1
white	1
linen,	1
and	1
having	1
their	1
breasts	1
girded	1
with	1
golden	1
girdles.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
gave	1
unto	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
seven	1
golden	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
smoke	1
from	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
power;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
till	1
the	1
seven	1
plagues	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
angels,	1
Go	1
your	1
ways,	1
and	1
pour	1
out	1
the	1
vials	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
went,	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
noisome	1
and	1
grievous	1
sore	1
upon	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
upon	1
them	1
which	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
became	1
as	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man:	1
and	1
every	1
living	1
soul	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
rivers	1
and	1
fountains	1
of	1
waters;	1
and	1
they	1
became	1
blood.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
righteous,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
which	1
art,	1
and	1
wast,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
judged	1
thus.	1
	1
16:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
saints	1
and	1
prophets,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
them	1
blood	1
to	1
drink;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
say,	1
Even	1
so,	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty,	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
thy	1
judgments.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
power	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
scorch	1
men	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
men	1
were	1
scorched	1
with	1
great	1
heat,	1
and	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
plagues:	1
and	1
they	1
repented	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
glory.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
the	1
fifth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
beast;	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
darkness;	1
and	1
they	1
gnawed	1
their	1
tongues	1
for	1
pain,	1
16:11	1
And	1
blasphemed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
pains	1
and	1
their	1
sores,	1
and	1
repented	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
the	1
sixth	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
Euphrates;	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
thereof	1
was	1
dried	1
up,	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
might	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
three	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
like	1
frogs	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
dragon,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
false	1
prophet.	1
	1
16:14	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
devils,	1
working	1
miracles,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
unto	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
God	1
Almighty.	1
	1
16:15	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
thief.	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
watcheth,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
his	1
garments,	1
lest	1
he	1
walk	1
naked,	1
and	1
they	1
see	1
his	1
shame.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
he	1
gathered	1
them	1
together	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Armageddon.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventh	1
angel	1
poured	1
out	1
his	1
vial	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
heaven,	1
from	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
voices,	1
and	1
thunders,	1
and	1
lightnings;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
men	1
were	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
so	1
great.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
three	1
parts,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
Babylon	1
came	1
in	1
remembrance	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
her	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
wrath.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
every	1
island	1
fled	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
not	1
found.	1
	1
16:21	1
And	1
there	1
fell	1
upon	1
men	1
a	1
great	1
hail	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
every	1
stone	1
about	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
a	1
talent:	1
and	1
men	1
blasphemed	1
God	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
hail;	1
for	1
the	1
plague	1
thereof	1
was	1
exceeding	1
great.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Come	1
hither;	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
whore	1
that	1
sitteth	1
upon	1
many	1
waters:	1
17:2	1
With	1
whom	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
drunk	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
her	1
fornication.	1
	1
17:3	1
So	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
woman	1
sit	1
upon	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coloured	1
beast,	1
full	1
of	1
names	1
of	1
blasphemy,	1
having	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
arrayed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
scarlet	1
colour,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
and	1
pearls,	1
having	1
a	1
golden	1
cup	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
full	1
of	1
abominations	1
and	1
filthiness	1
of	1
her	1
fornication:	1
17:5	1
And	1
upon	1
her	1
forehead	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
MYSTERY,	1
BABYLON	1
THE	1
GREAT,	1
THE	1
MOTHER	1
OF	1
HARLOTS	1
AND	1
ABOMINATIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
EARTH.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
woman	1
drunken	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
martyrs	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
I	1
wondered	1
with	1
great	1
admiration.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
marvel?	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
carrieth	1
her,	1
which	1
hath	1
the	1
seven	1
heads	1
and	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
17:8	1
The	1
beast	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not;	1
and	1
shall	1
ascend	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
perdition:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
wonder,	1
whose	1
names	1
were	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
when	1
they	1
behold	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
yet	1
is.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
hath	1
wisdom.	1
The	1
seven	1
heads	1
are	1
seven	1
mountains,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
woman	1
sitteth.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
seven	1
kings:	1
five	1
are	1
fallen,	1
and	1
one	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
must	1
continue	1
a	1
short	1
space.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
that	1
was,	1
and	1
is	1
not,	1
even	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
eighth,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
seven,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
perdition.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
are	1
ten	1
kings,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
no	1
kingdom	1
as	1
yet;	1
but	1
receive	1
power	1
as	1
kings	1
one	1
hour	1
with	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:13	1
These	1
have	1
one	1
mind,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
power	1
and	1
strength	1
unto	1
the	1
beast.	1
	1
17:14	1
These	1
shall	1
make	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
Lamb,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
overcome	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
lords,	1
and	1
King	1
of	1
kings:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
him	1
are	1
called,	1
and	1
chosen,	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
waters	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
where	1
the	1
whore	1
sitteth,	1
are	1
peoples,	1
and	1
multitudes,	1
and	1
nations,	1
and	1
tongues.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
upon	1
the	1
beast,	1
these	1
shall	1
hate	1
the	1
whore,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
her	1
desolate	1
and	1
naked,	1
and	1
shall	1
eat	1
her	1
flesh,	1
and	1
burn	1
her	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
17:17	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
to	1
fulfil	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
to	1
agree,	1
and	1
give	1
their	1
kingdom	1
unto	1
the	1
beast,	1
until	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
is	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
which	1
reigneth	1
over	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
another	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
great	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
lightened	1
with	1
his	1
glory.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
mightily	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Babylon	1
the	1
great	1
is	1
fallen,	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
habitation	1
of	1
devils,	1
and	1
the	1
hold	1
of	1
every	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
and	1
a	1
cage	1
of	1
every	1
unclean	1
and	1
hateful	1
bird.	1
	1
18:3	1
For	1
all	1
nations	1
have	1
drunk	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
waxed	1
rich	1
through	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
her	1
delicacies.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
another	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
her,	1
my	1
people,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
partakers	1
of	1
her	1
sins,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
plagues.	1
	1
18:5	1
For	1
her	1
sins	1
have	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
remembered	1
her	1
iniquities.	1
	1
18:6	1
Reward	1
her	1
even	1
as	1
she	1
rewarded	1
you,	1
and	1
double	1
unto	1
her	1
double	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
works:	1
in	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
she	1
hath	1
filled	1
fill	1
to	1
her	1
double.	1
	1
18:7	1
How	1
much	1
she	1
hath	1
glorified	1
herself,	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously,	1
so	1
much	1
torment	1
and	1
sorrow	1
give	1
her:	1
for	1
she	1
saith	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
sit	1
a	1
queen,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
widow,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
sorrow.	1
	1
18:8	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
her	1
plagues	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
day,	1
death,	1
and	1
mourning,	1
and	1
famine;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
burned	1
with	1
fire:	1
for	1
strong	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
who	1
judgeth	1
her.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
who	1
have	1
committed	1
fornication	1
and	1
lived	1
deliciously	1
with	1
her,	1
shall	1
bewail	1
her,	1
and	1
lament	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
18:10	1
Standing	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
mighty	1
city!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
thy	1
judgment	1
come.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
the	1
merchants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
mourn	1
over	1
her;	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
buyeth	1
their	1
merchandise	1
any	1
more:	1
18:12	1
The	1
merchandise	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
of	1
pearls,	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
silk,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
all	1
thyine	1
wood,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
vessels	1
of	1
most	1
precious	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
iron,	1
and	1
marble,	1
18:13	1
And	1
cinnamon,	1
and	1
odours,	1
and	1
ointments,	1
and	1
frankincense,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
fine	1
flour,	1
and	1
wheat,	1
and	1
beasts,	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
horses,	1
and	1
chariots,	1
and	1
slaves,	1
and	1
souls	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
the	1
fruits	1
that	1
thy	1
soul	1
lusted	1
after	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
dainty	1
and	1
goodly	1
are	1
departed	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
them	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:15	1
The	1
merchants	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
by	1
her,	1
shall	1
stand	1
afar	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
torment,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
18:16	1
And	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
that	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
purple,	1
and	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
decked	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pearls!	1
	1
18:17	1
For	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
so	1
great	1
riches	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
And	1
every	1
shipmaster,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
ships,	1
and	1
sailors,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
trade	1
by	1
sea,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
18:18	1
And	1
cried	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
her	1
burning,	1
saying,	1
What	1
city	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
this	1
great	1
city!	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
dust	1
on	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
cried,	1
weeping	1
and	1
wailing,	1
saying,	1
Alas,	1
alas	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
were	1
made	1
rich	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
ships	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
costliness!	1
for	1
in	1
one	1
hour	1
is	1
she	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
18:20	1
Rejoice	1
over	1
her,	1
thou	1
heaven,	1
and	1
ye	1
holy	1
apostles	1
and	1
prophets;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
avenged	1
you	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
angel	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
stone	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
millstone,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
with	1
violence	1
shall	1
that	1
great	1
city	1
Babylon	1
be	1
thrown	1
down,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
harpers,	1
and	1
musicians,	1
and	1
of	1
pipers,	1
and	1
trumpeters,	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
no	1
craftsman,	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
craft	1
he	1
be,	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
millstone	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
18:23	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
shall	1
shine	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
bride	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
no	1
more	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
thee:	1
for	1
thy	1
merchants	1
were	1
the	1
great	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
by	1
thy	1
sorceries	1
were	1
all	1
nations	1
deceived.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
in	1
her	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
saints,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
slain	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
of	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia;	1
Salvation,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour,	1
and	1
power,	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God:	1
19:2	1
For	1
true	1
and	1
righteous	1
are	1
his	1
judgments:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
judged	1
the	1
great	1
whore,	1
which	1
did	1
corrupt	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
fornication,	1
and	1
hath	1
avenged	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
at	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
again	1
they	1
said,	1
Alleluia	1
And	1
her	1
smoke	1
rose	1
up	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
beasts	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
God	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Amen;	1
Alleluia.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne,	1
saying,	1
Praise	1
our	1
God,	1
all	1
ye	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
him,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
many	1
waters,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
mighty	1
thunderings,	1
saying,	1
Alleluia:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
omnipotent	1
reigneth.	1
	1
19:7	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
give	1
honour	1
to	1
him:	1
for	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
hath	1
made	1
herself	1
ready.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
granted	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
arrayed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
clean	1
and	1
white:	1
for	1
the	1
fine	1
linen	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
saints.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
sayings	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
worship	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prophecy.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
white	1
horse;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
him	1
was	1
called	1
Faithful	1
and	1
True,	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness	1
he	1
doth	1
judge	1
and	1
make	1
war.	1
	1
19:12	1
His	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
were	1
many	1
crowns;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
knew,	1
but	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
a	1
vesture	1
dipped	1
in	1
blood:	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
Word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
the	1
armies	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
heaven	1
followed	1
him	1
upon	1
white	1
horses,	1
clothed	1
in	1
fine	1
linen,	1
white	1
and	1
clean.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword,	1
that	1
with	1
it	1
he	1
should	1
smite	1
the	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
rule	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
of	1
iron:	1
and	1
he	1
treadeth	1
the	1
winepress	1
of	1
the	1
fierceness	1
and	1
wrath	1
of	1
Almighty	1
God.	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
on	1
his	1
vesture	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
thigh	1
a	1
name	1
written,	1
KING	1
OF	1
KINGS,	1
AND	1
LORD	1
OF	1
LORDS.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
that	1
fly	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
heaven,	1
Come	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
supper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
God;	1
19:18	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
mighty	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
both	1
free	1
and	1
bond,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
great.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
armies,	1
gathered	1
together	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
horse,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
army.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
taken,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
that	1
wrought	1
miracles	1
before	1
him,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
deceived	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
beast,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worshipped	1
his	1
image.	1
These	1
both	1
were	1
cast	1
alive	1
into	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
burning	1
with	1
brimstone.	1
	1
19:21	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
were	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
horse,	1
which	1
sword	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
fowls	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
flesh.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
angel	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
having	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
chain	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
dragon,	1
that	1
old	1
serpent,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Devil,	1
and	1
Satan,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
20:3	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
and	1
shut	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
no	1
more,	1
till	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
loosed	1
a	1
little	1
season.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
thrones,	1
and	1
they	1
sat	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
beheaded	1
for	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
worshipped	1
the	1
beast,	1
neither	1
his	1
image,	1
neither	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
mark	1
upon	1
their	1
foreheads,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
they	1
lived	1
and	1
reigned	1
with	1
Christ	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:5	1
But	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
lived	1
not	1
again	1
until	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
were	1
finished.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:6	1
Blessed	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
resurrection:	1
on	1
such	1
the	1
second	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
power,	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
priests	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
shall	1
reign	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
years.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
thousand	1
years	1
are	1
expired,	1
Satan	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
prison,	1
20:8	1
And	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
Gog,	1
and	1
Magog,	1
to	1
gather	1
them	1
together	1
to	1
battle:	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
whom	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
compassed	1
the	1
camp	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
beloved	1
city:	1
and	1
fire	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
devoured	1
them.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
that	1
deceived	1
them	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone,	1
where	1
the	1
beast	1
and	1
the	1
false	1
prophet	1
are,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
tormented	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
throne,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
sat	1
on	1
it,	1
from	1
whose	1
face	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven	1
fled	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
found	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dead,	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
stand	1
before	1
God;	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened:	1
and	1
another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life:	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
were	1
judged	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
books,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
judged	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
death	1
and	1
hell	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
whosoever	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
fire.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
new	1
heaven	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
earth	1
were	1
passed	1
away;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
sea.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
new	1
Jerusalem,	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
prepared	1
as	1
a	1
bride	1
adorned	1
for	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
men,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
dwell	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
God	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
God	1
shall	1
wipe	1
away	1
all	1
tears	1
from	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
death,	1
neither	1
sorrow,	1
nor	1
crying,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
pain:	1
for	1
the	1
former	1
things	1
are	1
passed	1
away.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
make	1
all	1
things	1
new.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Write:	1
for	1
these	1
words	1
are	1
true	1
and	1
faithful.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
It	1
is	1
done.	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
of	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
21:7	1
He	1
that	1
overcometh	1
shall	1
inherit	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:8	1
But	1
the	1
fearful,	1
and	1
unbelieving,	1
and	1
the	1
abominable,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
all	1
liars,	1
shall	1
have	1
their	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
lake	1
which	1
burneth	1
with	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
death.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
angels	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
seven	1
vials	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
last	1
plagues,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
hither,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
bride,	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
wife.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
he	1
carried	1
me	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
the	1
holy	1
Jerusalem,	1
descending	1
out	1
of	1
heaven	1
from	1
God,	1
21:11	1
Having	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
her	1
light	1
was	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
stone	1
most	1
precious,	1
even	1
like	1
a	1
jasper	1
stone,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal;	1
21:12	1
And	1
had	1
a	1
wall	1
great	1
and	1
high,	1
and	1
had	1
twelve	1
gates,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
twelve	1
angels,	1
and	1
names	1
written	1
thereon,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
21:13	1
On	1
the	1
east	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
three	1
gates;	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
three	1
gates;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
three	1
gates.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
twelve	1
foundations,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
had	1
a	1
golden	1
reed	1
to	1
measure	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
lieth	1
foursquare,	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
is	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
breadth:	1
and	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
the	1
reed,	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
furlongs.	1
	1
The	1
length	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
equal.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
measured	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
and	1
four	1
cubits,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
jasper:	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
like	1
unto	1
clear	1
glass.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
were	1
garnished	1
with	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
precious	1
stones.	1
The	1
first	1
foundation	1
was	1
jasper;	1
the	1
second,	1
sapphire;	1
the	1
third,	1
a	1
chalcedony;	1
the	1
fourth,	1
an	1
emerald;	1
21:20	1
The	1
fifth,	1
sardonyx;	1
the	1
sixth,	1
sardius;	1
the	1
seventh,	1
chrysolyte;	1
the	1
eighth,	1
beryl;	1
the	1
ninth,	1
a	1
topaz;	1
the	1
tenth,	1
a	1
chrysoprasus;	1
the	1
eleventh,	1
a	1
jacinth;	1
the	1
twelfth,	1
an	1
amethyst.	1
	1
21:21	1
And	1
the	1
twelve	1
gates	1
were	1
twelve	1
pearls:	1
every	1
several	1
gate	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
pearl:	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
pure	1
gold,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
transparent	1
glass.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
temple	1
therein:	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
Almighty	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
the	1
city	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
to	1
shine	1
in	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
did	1
lighten	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
Lamb	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
do	1
bring	1
their	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
shut	1
at	1
all	1
by	1
day:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there.	1
	1
21:26	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
bring	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
into	1
it	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
defileth,	1
neither	1
whatsoever	1
worketh	1
abomination,	1
or	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie:	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
Lamb's	1
book	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
a	1
pure	1
river	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
life,	1
clear	1
as	1
crystal,	1
proceeding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb.	1
	1
22:2	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
bare	1
twelve	1
manner	1
of	1
fruits,	1
and	1
yielded	1
her	1
fruit	1
every	1
month:	1
and	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
healing	1
of	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
22:3	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
curse:	1
but	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Lamb	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
shall	1
serve	1
him:	1
22:4	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
foreheads.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
night	1
there;	1
and	1
they	1
need	1
no	1
candle,	1
neither	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
giveth	1
them	1
light:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reign	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
sayings	1
are	1
faithful	1
and	1
true:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
prophets	1
sent	1
his	1
angel	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
must	1
shortly	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly:	1
blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
keepeth	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
John	1
saw	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
I	1
fell	1
down	1
to	1
worship	1
before	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
shewed	1
me	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
22:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
See	1
thou	1
do	1
it	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
and	1
of	1
thy	1
brethren	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
worship	1
God.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Seal	1
not	1
the	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book:	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
22:11	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unjust,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unjust	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
filthy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
filthy	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
righteous,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
righteous	1
still:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
holy,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
holy	1
still.	1
	1
22:12	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
come	1
quickly;	1
and	1
my	1
reward	1
is	1
with	1
me,	1
to	1
give	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
his	1
work	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
22:13	1
I	1
am	1
Alpha	1
and	1
Omega,	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
last.	1
	1
22:14	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
his	1
commandments,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
tree	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
may	1
enter	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
gates	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
without	1
are	1
dogs,	1
and	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
whoremongers,	1
and	1
murderers,	1
and	1
idolaters,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
loveth	1
and	1
maketh	1
a	1
lie.	1
	1
22:16	1
I	1
Jesus	1
have	1
sent	1
mine	1
angel	1
to	1
testify	1
unto	1
you	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
churches.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
the	1
bright	1
and	1
morning	1
star.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
heareth	1
say,	1
Come.	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
athirst	1
come.	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
life	1
freely.	1
	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
testify	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
this	1
book,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
these	1
things,	1
God	1
shall	1
add	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
plagues	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
22:19	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
this	1
prophecy,	1
God	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
part	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book.	1
	1
22:20	1
He	1
which	1
testifieth	1
these	1
things	1
saith,	1
Surely	1
I	1
come	1
quickly.	1
Amen.	1
	1
Even	1
so,	1
come,	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
22:21	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1

	1
I.	1
	1
To	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
she	1
is	1
always	1
THE	1
woman.	1
I	1
have	1
seldom	1
heard	1
him	1
mention	1
her	1
under	1
any	1
other	1
name.	1
In	1
his	1
eyes	1
she	1
eclipses	1
and	1
predominates	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
sex.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
any	1
emotion	1
akin	1
to	1
love	1
for	1
Irene	1
Adler.	1
All	1
emotions,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
particularly,	1
were	1
abhorrent	1
to	1
his	1
cold,	1
precise	1
but	1
admirably	1
balanced	1
mind.	1
He	1
was,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
reasoning	1
and	1
observing	1
machine	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
seen,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
placed	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
false	1
position.	1
He	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
softer	1
passions,	1
save	1
with	1
a	1
gibe	1
and	1
a	1
sneer.	1
They	1
were	1
admirable	1
things	1
for	1
the	1
observer--excellent	1
for	1
drawing	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
men's	1
motives	1
and	1
actions.	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
trained	1
reasoner	1
to	1
admit	1
such	1
intrusions	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
delicate	1
and	1
finely	1
adjusted	1
temperament	1
was	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
distracting	1
factor	1
which	1
might	1
throw	1
a	1
doubt	1
upon	1
all	1
his	1
mental	1
results.	1
Grit	1
in	1
a	1
sensitive	1
instrument,	1
or	1
a	1
crack	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
high-power	1
lenses,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
disturbing	1
than	1
a	1
strong	1
emotion	1
in	1
a	1
nature	1
such	1
as	1
his.	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
woman	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
woman	1
was	1
the	1
late	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
of	1
dubious	1
and	1
questionable	1
memory.	1
	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
little	1
of	1
Holmes	1
lately.	1
My	1
marriage	1
had	1
drifted	1
us	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
My	1
own	1
complete	1
happiness,	1
and	1
the	1
home-centred	1
interests	1
which	1
rise	1
up	1
around	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
first	1
finds	1
himself	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
establishment,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
absorb	1
all	1
my	1
attention,	1
while	1
Holmes,	1
who	1
loathed	1
every	1
form	1
of	1
society	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
Bohemian	1
soul,	1
remained	1
in	1
our	1
lodgings	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
buried	1
among	1
his	1
old	1
books,	1
and	1
alternating	1
from	1
week	1
to	1
week	1
between	1
cocaine	1
and	1
ambition,	1
the	1
drowsiness	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
the	1
fierce	1
energy	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
keen	1
nature.	1
He	1
was	1
still,	1
as	1
ever,	1
deeply	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
crime,	1
and	1
occupied	1
his	1
immense	1
faculties	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
powers	1
of	1
observation	1
in	1
following	1
out	1
those	1
clues,	1
and	1
clearing	1
up	1
those	1
mysteries	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
as	1
hopeless	1
by	1
the	1
official	1
police.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
I	1
heard	1
some	1
vague	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
doings:	1
of	1
his	1
summons	1
to	1
Odessa	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Trepoff	1
murder,	1
of	1
his	1
clearing	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
tragedy	1
of	1
the	1
Atkinson	1
brothers	1
at	1
Trincomalee,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
mission	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
accomplished	1
so	1
delicately	1
and	1
successfully	1
for	1
the	1
reigning	1
family	1
of	1
Holland.	1
Beyond	1
these	1
signs	1
of	1
his	1
activity,	1
however,	1
which	1
I	1
merely	1
shared	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
readers	1
of	1
the	1
daily	1
press,	1
I	1
knew	1
little	1
of	1
my	1
former	1
friend	1
and	1
companion.	1
	1
One	1
night--it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
twentieth	1
of	1
March,	1
1888--I	1
was	1
returning	1
from	1
a	1
journey	1
to	1
a	1
patient	1
(for	1
I	1
had	1
now	1
returned	1
to	1
civil	1
practice),	1
when	1
my	1
way	1
led	1
me	1
through	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
well-remembered	1
door,	1
which	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
associated	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
with	1
my	1
wooing,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
dark	1
incidents	1
of	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
I	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
a	1
keen	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
Holmes	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
employing	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
powers.	1
His	1
rooms	1
were	1
brilliantly	1
lit,	1
and,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
looked	1
up,	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
tall,	1
spare	1
figure	1
pass	1
twice	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
silhouette	1
against	1
the	1
blind.	1
He	1
was	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
swiftly,	1
eagerly,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
behind	1
him.	1
To	1
me,	1
who	1
knew	1
his	1
every	1
mood	1
and	1
habit,	1
his	1
attitude	1
and	1
manner	1
told	1
their	1
own	1
story.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
again.	1
He	1
had	1
risen	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
drug-created	1
dreams	1
and	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
some	1
new	1
problem.	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
was	1
shown	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
which	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
in	1
part	1
my	1
own.	1
	1
His	1
manner	1
was	1
not	1
effusive.	1
It	1
seldom	1
was;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
glad,	1
I	1
think,	1
to	1
see	1
me.	1
With	1
hardly	1
a	1
word	1
spoken,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
kindly	1
eye,	1
he	1
waved	1
me	1
to	1
an	1
armchair,	1
threw	1
across	1
his	1
case	1
of	1
cigars,	1
and	1
indicated	1
a	1
spirit	1
case	1
and	1
a	1
gasogene	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
Then	1
he	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
looked	1
me	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
singular	1
introspective	1
fashion.	1
	1
"Wedlock	1
suits	1
you,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
seven	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
pounds	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
you."	1
	1
"Seven!"	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
a	1
little	1
more.	1
Just	1
a	1
trifle	1
more,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
Watson.	1
And	1
in	1
practice	1
again,	1
I	1
observe.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
intended	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
harness."	1
	1
"Then,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
know?"	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
it,	1
I	1
deduce	1
it.	1
How	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
getting	1
yourself	1
very	1
wet	1
lately,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
most	1
clumsy	1
and	1
careless	1
servant	1
girl?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"this	1
is	1
too	1
much.	1
You	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
burned,	1
had	1
you	1
lived	1
a	1
few	1
centuries	1
ago.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
country	1
walk	1
on	1
Thursday	1
and	1
came	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
mess,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
changed	1
my	1
clothes	1
I	1
can't	1
imagine	1
how	1
you	1
deduce	1
it.	1
As	1
to	1
Mary	1
Jane,	1
she	1
is	1
incorrigible,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
has	1
given	1
her	1
notice,	1
but	1
there,	1
again,	1
I	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
you	1
work	1
it	1
out."	1
	1
He	1
chuckled	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
long,	1
nervous	1
hands	1
together.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
simplicity	1
itself,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"my	1
eyes	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
your	1
left	1
shoe,	1
just	1
where	1
the	1
firelight	1
strikes	1
it,	1
the	1
leather	1
is	1
scored	1
by	1
six	1
almost	1
parallel	1
cuts.	1
Obviously	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
caused	1
by	1
someone	1
who	1
has	1
very	1
carelessly	1
scraped	1
round	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
sole	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remove	1
crusted	1
mud	1
from	1
it.	1
Hence,	1
you	1
see,	1
my	1
double	1
deduction	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
in	1
vile	1
weather,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
particularly	1
malignant	1
boot-slitting	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
London	1
slavey.	1
As	1
to	1
your	1
practice,	1
if	1
a	1
gentleman	1
walks	1
into	1
my	1
rooms	1
smelling	1
of	1
iodoform,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
mark	1
of	1
nitrate	1
of	1
silver	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
forefinger,	1
and	1
a	1
bulge	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
top-hat	1
to	1
show	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
secreted	1
his	1
stethoscope,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
dull,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pronounce	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
active	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
medical	1
profession."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
explained	1
his	1
process	1
of	1
deduction.	1
"When	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
reasons,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"the	1
thing	1
always	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
ridiculously	1
simple	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
do	1
it	1
myself,	1
though	1
at	1
each	1
successive	1
instance	1
of	1
your	1
reasoning	1
I	1
am	1
baffled	1
until	1
you	1
explain	1
your	1
process.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
are	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
yours."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
lighting	1
a	1
cigarette,	1
and	1
throwing	1
himself	1
down	1
into	1
an	1
armchair.	1
"You	1
see,	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
observe.	1
The	1
distinction	1
is	1
clear.	1
For	1
example,	1
you	1
have	1
frequently	1
seen	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
lead	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
this	1
room."	1
	1
"Frequently."	1
	1
"How	1
often?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times."	1
	1
"Then	1
how	1
many	1
are	1
there?"	1
	1
"How	1
many?	1
I	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so!	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
observed.	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
That	1
is	1
just	1
my	1
point.	1
Now,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
seventeen	1
steps,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
observed.	1
By-the-way,	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
interested	1
in	1
these	1
little	1
problems,	1
and	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
chronicle	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
trifling	1
experiences,	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
this."	1
He	1
threw	1
over	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
thick,	1
pink-tinted	1
note-paper	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
open	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
"It	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
post,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Read	1
it	1
aloud."	1
	1
The	1
note	1
was	1
undated,	1
and	1
without	1
either	1
signature	1
or	1
address.	1
	1
"There	1
will	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
to-night,	1
at	1
a	1
quarter	1
to	1
eight	1
o'clock,"	1
it	1
said,	1
"a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
desires	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
upon	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
deepest	1
moment.	1
Your	1
recent	1
services	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
houses	1
of	1
Europe	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
one	1
who	1
may	1
safely	1
be	1
trusted	1
with	1
matters	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
an	1
importance	1
which	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
exaggerated.	1
This	1
account	1
of	1
you	1
we	1
have	1
from	1
all	1
quarters	1
received.	1
Be	1
in	1
your	1
chamber	1
then	1
at	1
that	1
hour,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
amiss	1
if	1
your	1
visitor	1
wear	1
a	1
mask."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
mystery,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
means?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
data	1
yet.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
mistake	1
to	1
theorize	1
before	1
one	1
has	1
data.	1
Insensibly	1
one	1
begins	1
to	1
twist	1
facts	1
to	1
suit	1
theories,	1
instead	1
of	1
theories	1
to	1
suit	1
facts.	1
But	1
the	1
note	1
itself.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
from	1
it?"	1
	1
I	1
carefully	1
examined	1
the	1
writing,	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
upon	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
"The	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
it	1
was	1
presumably	1
well	1
to	1
do,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
imitate	1
my	1
companion's	1
processes.	1
"Such	1
paper	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
bought	1
under	1
half	1
a	1
crown	1
a	1
packet.	1
It	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
strong	1
and	1
stiff."	1
	1
"Peculiar--that	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
word,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
English	1
paper	1
at	1
all.	1
Hold	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
light."	1
	1
I	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
large	1
"E"	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
"g,"	1
a	1
"P,"	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
"G"	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
"t"	1
woven	1
into	1
the	1
texture	1
of	1
the	1
paper.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"The	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
maker,	1
no	1
doubt;	1
or	1
his	1
monogram,	1
rather."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
'G'	1
with	1
the	1
small	1
't'	1
stands	1
for	1
'Gesellschaft,'	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
for	1
'Company.'	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
customary	1
contraction	1
like	1
our	1
'Co.'	1
'P,'	1
of	1
course,	1
stands	1
for	1
'Papier.'	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
'Eg.'	1
Let	1
us	1
glance	1
at	1
our	1
Continental	1
Gazetteer."	1
He	1
took	1
down	1
a	1
heavy	1
brown	1
volume	1
from	1
his	1
shelves.	1
"Eglow,	1
Eglonitz--here	1
we	1
are,	1
Egria.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
German-speaking	1
country--in	1
Bohemia,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Carlsbad.	1
'Remarkable	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Wallenstein,	1
and	1
for	1
its	1
numerous	1
glass-factories	1
and	1
paper-mills.'	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
my	1
boy,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that?"	1
His	1
eyes	1
sparkled,	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
blue	1
triumphant	1
cloud	1
from	1
his	1
cigarette.	1
	1
"The	1
paper	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
Bohemia,"	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
the	1
note	1
is	1
a	1
German.	1
Do	1
you	1
note	1
the	1
peculiar	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
sentence--'This	1
account	1
of	1
you	1
we	1
have	1
from	1
all	1
quarters	1
received.'	1
A	1
Frenchman	1
or	1
Russian	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
written	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
German	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
uncourteous	1
to	1
his	1
verbs.	1
It	1
only	1
remains,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
is	1
wanted	1
by	1
this	1
German	1
who	1
writes	1
upon	1
Bohemian	1
paper	1
and	1
prefers	1
wearing	1
a	1
mask	1
to	1
showing	1
his	1
face.	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
comes,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken,	1
to	1
resolve	1
all	1
our	1
doubts."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
sharp	1
sound	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
and	1
grating	1
wheels	1
against	1
the	1
curb,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
sharp	1
pull	1
at	1
the	1
bell.	1
Holmes	1
whistled.	1
	1
"A	1
pair,	1
by	1
the	1
sound,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Yes,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
"A	1
nice	1
little	1
brougham	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
beauties.	1
A	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
apiece.	1
There's	1
money	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
Watson,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
else."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
go,	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bit,	1
Doctor.	1
Stay	1
where	1
you	1
are.	1
I	1
am	1
lost	1
without	1
my	1
Boswell.	1
And	1
this	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
interesting.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pity	1
to	1
miss	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
your	1
client--"	1
	1
"Never	1
mind	1
him.	1
I	1
may	1
want	1
your	1
help,	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
he.	1
Here	1
he	1
comes.	1
Sit	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
armchair,	1
Doctor,	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
your	1
best	1
attention."	1
	1
A	1
slow	1
and	1
heavy	1
step,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
paused	1
immediately	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
authoritative	1
tap.	1
	1
"Come	1
in!"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
A	1
man	1
entered	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
than	1
six	1
feet	1
six	1
inches	1
in	1
height,	1
with	1
the	1
chest	1
and	1
limbs	1
of	1
a	1
Hercules.	1
His	1
dress	1
was	1
rich	1
with	1
a	1
richness	1
which	1
would,	1
in	1
England,	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
akin	1
to	1
bad	1
taste.	1
Heavy	1
bands	1
of	1
astrakhan	1
were	1
slashed	1
across	1
the	1
sleeves	1
and	1
fronts	1
of	1
his	1
double-breasted	1
coat,	1
while	1
the	1
deep	1
blue	1
cloak	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
over	1
his	1
shoulders	1
was	1
lined	1
with	1
flame-coloured	1
silk	1
and	1
secured	1
at	1
the	1
neck	1
with	1
a	1
brooch	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
flaming	1
beryl.	1
Boots	1
which	1
extended	1
halfway	1
up	1
his	1
calves,	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
trimmed	1
at	1
the	1
tops	1
with	1
rich	1
brown	1
fur,	1
completed	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
barbaric	1
opulence	1
which	1
was	1
suggested	1
by	1
his	1
whole	1
appearance.	1
He	1
carried	1
a	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
while	1
he	1
wore	1
across	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
extending	1
down	1
past	1
the	1
cheekbones,	1
a	1
black	1
vizard	1
mask,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
adjusted	1
that	1
very	1
moment,	1
for	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
still	1
raised	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
From	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
strong	1
character,	1
with	1
a	1
thick,	1
hanging	1
lip,	1
and	1
a	1
long,	1
straight	1
chin	1
suggestive	1
of	1
resolution	1
pushed	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
obstinacy.	1
	1
"You	1
had	1
my	1
note?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
harsh	1
voice	1
and	1
a	1
strongly	1
marked	1
German	1
accent.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
call."	1
He	1
looked	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
if	1
uncertain	1
which	1
to	1
address.	1
	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
who	1
is	1
occasionally	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
cases.	1
Whom	1
have	1
I	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
address?"	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
address	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
Count	1
Von	1
Kramm,	1
a	1
Bohemian	1
nobleman.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
your	1
friend,	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
discretion,	1
whom	1
I	1
may	1
trust	1
with	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
extreme	1
importance.	1
If	1
not,	1
I	1
should	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
you	1
alone."	1
	1
I	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
Holmes	1
caught	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
wrist	1
and	1
pushed	1
me	1
back	1
into	1
my	1
chair.	1
"It	1
is	1
both,	1
or	1
none,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
may	1
say	1
before	1
this	1
gentleman	1
anything	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
Count	1
shrugged	1
his	1
broad	1
shoulders.	1
"Then	1
I	1
must	1
begin,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"by	1
binding	1
you	1
both	1
to	1
absolute	1
secrecy	1
for	1
two	1
years;	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
matter	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
importance.	1
At	1
present	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
weight	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
an	1
influence	1
upon	1
European	1
history."	1
	1
"I	1
promise,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"And	1
I."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
this	1
mask,"	1
continued	1
our	1
strange	1
visitor.	1
"The	1
august	1
person	1
who	1
employs	1
me	1
wishes	1
his	1
agent	1
to	1
be	1
unknown	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
confess	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
title	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
called	1
myself	1
is	1
not	1
exactly	1
my	1
own."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
dryly.	1
	1
"The	1
circumstances	1
are	1
of	1
great	1
delicacy,	1
and	1
every	1
precaution	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
quench	1
what	1
might	1
grow	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
immense	1
scandal	1
and	1
seriously	1
compromise	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
reigning	1
families	1
of	1
Europe.	1
To	1
speak	1
plainly,	1
the	1
matter	1
implicates	1
the	1
great	1
House	1
of	1
Ormstein,	1
hereditary	1
kings	1
of	1
Bohemia."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
also	1
aware	1
of	1
that,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes,	1
settling	1
himself	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
glanced	1
with	1
some	1
apparent	1
surprise	1
at	1
the	1
languid,	1
lounging	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
doubt	1
depicted	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
incisive	1
reasoner	1
and	1
most	1
energetic	1
agent	1
in	1
Europe.	1
Holmes	1
slowly	1
reopened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
impatiently	1
at	1
his	1
gigantic	1
client.	1
	1
"If	1
your	1
Majesty	1
would	1
condescend	1
to	1
state	1
your	1
case,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
advise	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
uncontrollable	1
agitation.	1
Then,	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation,	1
he	1
tore	1
the	1
mask	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
hurled	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
he	1
cried;	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
King.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
attempt	1
to	1
conceal	1
it?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
indeed?"	1
murmured	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
addressing	1
Wilhelm	1
Gottsreich	1
Sigismond	1
von	1
Ormstein,	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
of	1
Cassel-Felstein,	1
and	1
hereditary	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can	1
understand,"	1
said	1
our	1
strange	1
visitor,	1
sitting	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
high	1
white	1
forehead,	1
"you	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
accustomed	1
to	1
doing	1
such	1
business	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
person.	1
Yet	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
so	1
delicate	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
confide	1
it	1
to	1
an	1
agent	1
without	1
putting	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
incognito	1
from	1
Prague	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
consulting	1
you."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray	1
consult,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
shutting	1
his	1
eyes	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
facts	1
are	1
briefly	1
these:	1
Some	1
five	1
years	1
ago,	1
during	1
a	1
lengthy	1
visit	1
to	1
Warsaw,	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
well-known	1
adventuress,	1
Irene	1
Adler.	1
The	1
name	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
familiar	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Kindly	1
look	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
index,	1
Doctor,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes	1
without	1
opening	1
his	1
eyes.	1
For	1
many	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
adopted	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
docketing	1
all	1
paragraphs	1
concerning	1
men	1
and	1
things,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
name	1
a	1
subject	1
or	1
a	1
person	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
furnish	1
information.	1
In	1
this	1
case	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
biography	1
sandwiched	1
in	1
between	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
Hebrew	1
rabbi	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
staff-commander	1
who	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
monograph	1
upon	1
the	1
deep-sea	1
fishes.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
see!"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Hum!	1
Born	1
in	1
New	1
Jersey	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1858.	1
Contralto--hum!	1
La	1
Scala,	1
hum!	1
Prima	1
donna	1
Imperial	1
Opera	1
of	1
Warsaw--yes!	1
Retired	1
from	1
operatic	1
stage--ha!	1
Living	1
in	1
London--quite	1
so!	1
Your	1
Majesty,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
became	1
entangled	1
with	1
this	1
young	1
person,	1
wrote	1
her	1
some	1
compromising	1
letters,	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
desirous	1
of	1
getting	1
those	1
letters	1
back."	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
But	1
how--"	1
	1
"Was	1
there	1
a	1
secret	1
marriage?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"No	1
legal	1
papers	1
or	1
certificates?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
fail	1
to	1
follow	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
If	1
this	1
young	1
person	1
should	1
produce	1
her	1
letters	1
for	1
blackmailing	1
or	1
other	1
purposes,	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
to	1
prove	1
their	1
authenticity?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
writing."	1
	1
"Pooh,	1
pooh!	1
Forgery."	1
	1
"My	1
private	1
note-paper."	1
	1
"Stolen."	1
	1
"My	1
own	1
seal."	1
	1
"Imitated."	1
	1
"My	1
photograph."	1
	1
"Bought."	1
	1
"We	1
were	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
photograph."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
dear!	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
bad!	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
has	1
indeed	1
committed	1
an	1
indiscretion."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
mad--insane."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
compromised	1
yourself	1
seriously."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
only	1
Crown	1
Prince	1
then.	1
I	1
was	1
young.	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
thirty	1
now."	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
recovered."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
tried	1
and	1
failed."	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
must	1
pay.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
bought."	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
not	1
sell."	1
	1
"Stolen,	1
then."	1
	1
"Five	1
attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made.	1
Twice	1
burglars	1
in	1
my	1
pay	1
ransacked	1
her	1
house.	1
Once	1
we	1
diverted	1
her	1
luggage	1
when	1
she	1
travelled.	1
Twice	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
waylaid.	1
There	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
result."	1
	1
"No	1
sign	1
of	1
it?"	1
	1
"Absolutely	1
none."	1
	1
Holmes	1
laughed.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
problem,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
one	1
to	1
me,"	1
returned	1
the	1
King	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"Very,	1
indeed.	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"To	1
ruin	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
how?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
married."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
have	1
heard."	1
	1
"To	1
Clotilde	1
Lothman	1
von	1
Saxe-Meningen,	1
second	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Scandinavia.	1
You	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
strict	1
principles	1
of	1
her	1
family.	1
She	1
is	1
herself	1
the	1
very	1
soul	1
of	1
delicacy.	1
A	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
conduct	1
would	1
bring	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
an	1
end."	1
	1
"And	1
Irene	1
Adler?"	1
	1
"Threatens	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
the	1
photograph.	1
And	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
soul	1
of	1
steel.	1
She	1
has	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
of	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
of	1
men.	1
Rather	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
marry	1
another	1
woman,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
lengths	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
go--none."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
it	1
yet?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure."	1
	1
"And	1
why?"	1
	1
"Because	1
she	1
has	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
send	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
betrothal	1
was	1
publicly	1
proclaimed.	1
That	1
will	1
be	1
next	1
Monday."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
three	1
days	1
yet,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
yawn.	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
fortunate,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
matters	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
just	1
at	1
present.	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
stay	1
in	1
London	1
for	1
the	1
present?"	1
	1
"Certainly.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
Langham	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Count	1
Von	1
Kramm."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
drop	1
you	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
we	1
progress."	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
anxiety."	1
	1
"Then,	1
as	1
to	1
money?"	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
carte	1
blanche."	1
	1
"Absolutely?"	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
photograph."	1
	1
"And	1
for	1
present	1
expenses?"	1
	1
The	1
King	1
took	1
a	1
heavy	1
chamois	1
leather	1
bag	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
three	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
seven	1
hundred	1
in	1
notes,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Holmes	1
scribbled	1
a	1
receipt	1
upon	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
his	1
note-book	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
Mademoiselle's	1
address?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Is	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue,	1
St.	1
John's	1
Wood."	1
	1
Holmes	1
took	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
it.	1
"One	1
other	1
question,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Was	1
the	1
photograph	1
a	1
cabinet?"	1
	1
"It	1
was."	1
	1
"Then,	1
good-night,	1
your	1
Majesty,	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
have	1
some	1
good	1
news	1
for	1
you.	1
And	1
good-night,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
added,	1
as	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
brougham	1
rolled	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
"If	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
to-morrow	1
afternoon	1
at	1
three	1
o'clock	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
chat	1
this	1
little	1
matter	1
over	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
	1
II.	1
	1
At	1
three	1
o'clock	1
precisely	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
but	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
returned.	1
The	1
landlady	1
informed	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
shortly	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
I	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
fire,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
awaiting	1
him,	1
however	1
long	1
he	1
might	1
be.	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
his	1
inquiry,	1
for,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
surrounded	1
by	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
grim	1
and	1
strange	1
features	1
which	1
were	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
crimes	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
recorded,	1
still,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
the	1
exalted	1
station	1
of	1
his	1
client	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
Indeed,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
investigation	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
had	1
on	1
hand,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
masterly	1
grasp	1
of	1
a	1
situation,	1
and	1
his	1
keen,	1
incisive	1
reasoning,	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
study	1
his	1
system	1
of	1
work,	1
and	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
quick,	1
subtle	1
methods	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
disentangled	1
the	1
most	1
inextricable	1
mysteries.	1
So	1
accustomed	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
his	1
invariable	1
success	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
failing	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
close	1
upon	1
four	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
drunken-looking	1
groom,	1
ill-kempt	1
and	1
side-whiskered,	1
with	1
an	1
inflamed	1
face	1
and	1
disreputable	1
clothes,	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Accustomed	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
friend's	1
amazing	1
powers	1
in	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
disguises,	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
three	1
times	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
indeed	1
he.	1
With	1
a	1
nod	1
he	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
whence	1
he	1
emerged	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
tweed-suited	1
and	1
respectable,	1
as	1
of	1
old.	1
Putting	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
his	1
pockets,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
for	1
some	1
minutes.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
choked	1
and	1
laughed	1
again	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
lie	1
back,	1
limp	1
and	1
helpless,	1
in	1
the	1
chair.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"It's	1
quite	1
too	1
funny.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
never	1
guess	1
how	1
I	1
employed	1
my	1
morning,	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
ended	1
by	1
doing."	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
imagine.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
watching	1
the	1
habits,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
house,	1
of	1
Miss	1
Irene	1
Adler."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so;	1
but	1
the	1
sequel	1
was	1
rather	1
unusual.	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
however.	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
this	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
groom	1
out	1
of	1
work.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
sympathy	1
and	1
freemasonry	1
among	1
horsey	1
men.	1
Be	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
know.	1
I	1
soon	1
found	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
bijou	1
villa,	1
with	1
a	1
garden	1
at	1
the	1
back,	1
but	1
built	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
two	1
stories.	1
Chubb	1
lock	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
Large	1
sitting-room	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
well	1
furnished,	1
with	1
long	1
windows	1
almost	1
to	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
those	1
preposterous	1
English	1
window	1
fasteners	1
which	1
a	1
child	1
could	1
open.	1
Behind	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable,	1
save	1
that	1
the	1
passage	1
window	1
could	1
be	1
reached	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
coach-house.	1
I	1
walked	1
round	1
it	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
closely	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
but	1
without	1
noting	1
anything	1
else	1
of	1
interest.	1
	1
"I	1
then	1
lounged	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
found,	1
as	1
I	1
expected,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mews	1
in	1
a	1
lane	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
by	1
one	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
I	1
lent	1
the	1
ostlers	1
a	1
hand	1
in	1
rubbing	1
down	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
received	1
in	1
exchange	1
twopence,	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
half	1
and	1
half,	1
two	1
fills	1
of	1
shag	1
tobacco,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
information	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
desire	1
about	1
Miss	1
Adler,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
other	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
interested,	1
but	1
whose	1
biographies	1
I	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
listen	1
to."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
she	1
has	1
turned	1
all	1
the	1
men's	1
heads	1
down	1
in	1
that	1
part.	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
daintiest	1
thing	1
under	1
a	1
bonnet	1
on	1
this	1
planet.	1
So	1
say	1
the	1
Serpentine-mews,	1
to	1
a	1
man.	1
She	1
lives	1
quietly,	1
sings	1
at	1
concerts,	1
drives	1
out	1
at	1
five	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
returns	1
at	1
seven	1
sharp	1
for	1
dinner.	1
Seldom	1
goes	1
out	1
at	1
other	1
times,	1
except	1
when	1
she	1
sings.	1
Has	1
only	1
one	1
male	1
visitor,	1
but	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
dark,	1
handsome,	1
and	1
dashing,	1
never	1
calls	1
less	1
than	1
once	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
often	1
twice.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
of	1
the	1
Inner	1
Temple.	1
See	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
cabman	1
as	1
a	1
confidant.	1
They	1
had	1
driven	1
him	1
home	1
a	1
dozen	1
times	1
from	1
Serpentine-mews,	1
and	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
him.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
tell,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
near	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
my	1
plan	1
of	1
campaign.	1
	1
"This	1
Godfrey	1
Norton	1
was	1
evidently	1
an	1
important	1
factor	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
lawyer.	1
That	1
sounded	1
ominous.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
repeated	1
visits?	1
Was	1
she	1
his	1
client,	1
his	1
friend,	1
or	1
his	1
mistress?	1
If	1
the	1
former,	1
she	1
had	1
probably	1
transferred	1
the	1
photograph	1
to	1
his	1
keeping.	1
If	1
the	1
latter,	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
likely.	1
On	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
this	1
question	1
depended	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
continue	1
my	1
work	1
at	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
or	1
turn	1
my	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
chambers	1
in	1
the	1
Temple.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
delicate	1
point,	1
and	1
it	1
widened	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
my	1
inquiry.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
bore	1
you	1
with	1
these	1
details,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
little	1
difficulties,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
situation."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
following	1
you	1
closely,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
still	1
balancing	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
when	1
a	1
hansom	1
cab	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
sprang	1
out.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
handsome	1
man,	1
dark,	1
aquiline,	1
and	1
moustached--evidently	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
heard.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
hurry,	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
brushed	1
past	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
at	1
home.	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
catch	1
glimpses	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
sitting-room,	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
talking	1
excitedly,	1
and	1
waving	1
his	1
arms.	1
Of	1
her	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
nothing.	1
Presently	1
he	1
emerged,	1
looking	1
even	1
more	1
flurried	1
than	1
before.	1
As	1
he	1
stepped	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
he	1
pulled	1
a	1
gold	1
watch	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
earnestly,	1
'Drive	1
like	1
the	1
devil,'	1
he	1
shouted,	1
'first	1
to	1
Gross	1
&	1
Hankey's	1
in	1
Regent	1
Street,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica	1
in	1
the	1
Edgeware	1
Road.	1
Half	1
a	1
guinea	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes!'	1
	1
"Away	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
wondering	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
when	1
up	1
the	1
lane	1
came	1
a	1
neat	1
little	1
landau,	1
the	1
coachman	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
only	1
half-buttoned,	1
and	1
his	1
tie	1
under	1
his	1
ear,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
tags	1
of	1
his	1
harness	1
were	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
buckles.	1
It	1
hadn't	1
pulled	1
up	1
before	1
she	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
and	1
into	1
it.	1
I	1
only	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
moment,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
die	1
for.	1
	1
"'The	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica,	1
John,'	1
she	1
cried,	1
'and	1
half	1
a	1
sovereign	1
if	1
you	1
reach	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.'	1
	1
"This	1
was	1
quite	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
lose,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
was	1
just	1
balancing	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
run	1
for	1
it,	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
perch	1
behind	1
her	1
landau	1
when	1
a	1
cab	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
driver	1
looked	1
twice	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
shabby	1
fare,	1
but	1
I	1
jumped	1
in	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
object.	1
'The	1
Church	1
of	1
St.	1
Monica,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'and	1
half	1
a	1
sovereign	1
if	1
you	1
reach	1
it	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.'	1
It	1
was	1
twenty-five	1
minutes	1
to	1
twelve,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
enough	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
"My	1
cabby	1
drove	1
fast.	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I	1
ever	1
drove	1
faster,	1
but	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
there	1
before	1
us.	1
The	1
cab	1
and	1
the	1
landau	1
with	1
their	1
steaming	1
horses	1
were	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
I	1
arrived.	1
I	1
paid	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
church.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
there	1
save	1
the	1
two	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
followed	1
and	1
a	1
surpliced	1
clergyman,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
expostulating	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
standing	1
in	1
a	1
knot	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
I	1
lounged	1
up	1
the	1
side	1
aisle	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
idler	1
who	1
has	1
dropped	1
into	1
a	1
church.	1
Suddenly,	1
to	1
my	1
surprise,	1
the	1
three	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
faced	1
round	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
Godfrey	1
Norton	1
came	1
running	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
towards	1
me.	1
	1
"'Thank	1
God,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'You'll	1
do.	1
Come!	1
Come!'	1
	1
"'What	1
then?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Come,	1
man,	1
come,	1
only	1
three	1
minutes,	1
or	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
legal.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
half-dragged	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
before	1
I	1
knew	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
mumbling	1
responses	1
which	1
were	1
whispered	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
and	1
vouching	1
for	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing,	1
and	1
generally	1
assisting	1
in	1
the	1
secure	1
tying	1
up	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
spinster,	1
to	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
bachelor.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
gentleman	1
thanking	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
while	1
the	1
clergyman	1
beamed	1
on	1
me	1
in	1
front.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
preposterous	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
ever	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
started	1
me	1
laughing	1
just	1
now.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
informality	1
about	1
their	1
license,	1
that	1
the	1
clergyman	1
absolutely	1
refused	1
to	1
marry	1
them	1
without	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
lucky	1
appearance	1
saved	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
from	1
having	1
to	1
sally	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
best	1
man.	1
The	1
bride	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
sovereign,	1
and	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
wear	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
watch-chain	1
in	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
occasion."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
unexpected	1
turn	1
of	1
affairs,"	1
said	1
I;	1
"and	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
plans	1
very	1
seriously	1
menaced.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
pair	1
might	1
take	1
an	1
immediate	1
departure,	1
and	1
so	1
necessitate	1
very	1
prompt	1
and	1
energetic	1
measures	1
on	1
my	1
part.	1
At	1
the	1
church	1
door,	1
however,	1
they	1
separated,	1
he	1
driving	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
Temple,	1
and	1
she	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
house.	1
'I	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
park	1
at	1
five	1
as	1
usual,'	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
left	1
him.	1
I	1
heard	1
no	1
more.	1
They	1
drove	1
away	1
in	1
different	1
directions,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
own	1
arrangements."	1
	1
"Which	1
are?"	1
	1
"Some	1
cold	1
beef	1
and	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
beer,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
ringing	1
the	1
bell.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
food,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
busier	1
still	1
this	1
evening.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
Doctor,	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
your	1
co-operation."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
mind	1
breaking	1
the	1
law?"	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least."	1
	1
"Nor	1
running	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
arrest?"	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
cause."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
cause	1
is	1
excellent!"	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
man."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rely	1
on	1
you."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
wish?"	1
	1
"When	1
Mrs.	1
Turner	1
has	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
tray	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
you.	1
Now,"	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
hungrily	1
on	1
the	1
simple	1
fare	1
that	1
our	1
landlady	1
had	1
provided,	1
"I	1
must	1
discuss	1
it	1
while	1
I	1
eat,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
much	1
time.	1
It	1
is	1
nearly	1
five	1
now.	1
In	1
two	1
hours	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
Miss	1
Irene,	1
or	1
Madame,	1
rather,	1
returns	1
from	1
her	1
drive	1
at	1
seven.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
to	1
meet	1
her."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
then?"	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
leave	1
that	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
arranged	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
occur.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
must	1
insist.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
interfere,	1
come	1
what	1
may.	1
You	1
understand?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
neutral?"	1
	1
"To	1
do	1
nothing	1
whatever.	1
There	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
some	1
small	1
unpleasantness.	1
Do	1
not	1
join	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
my	1
being	1
conveyed	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
Four	1
or	1
five	1
minutes	1
afterwards	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
window	1
will	1
open.	1
You	1
are	1
to	1
station	1
yourself	1
close	1
to	1
that	1
open	1
window."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
to	1
watch	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
visible	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"And	1
when	1
I	1
raise	1
my	1
hand--so--you	1
will	1
throw	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
what	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
throw,	1
and	1
will,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
fire.	1
You	1
quite	1
follow	1
me?"	1
	1
"Entirely."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
nothing	1
very	1
formidable,"	1
he	1
said,	1
taking	1
a	1
long	1
cigar-shaped	1
roll	1
from	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
ordinary	1
plumber's	1
smoke-rocket,	1
fitted	1
with	1
a	1
cap	1
at	1
either	1
end	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
self-lighting.	1
Your	1
task	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
that.	1
When	1
you	1
raise	1
your	1
cry	1
of	1
fire,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
quite	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
people.	1
You	1
may	1
then	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rejoin	1
you	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
myself	1
clear?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
to	1
remain	1
neutral,	1
to	1
get	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
to	1
watch	1
you,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
throw	1
in	1
this	1
object,	1
then	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
cry	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
to	1
wait	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street."	1
	1
"Precisely."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
may	1
entirely	1
rely	1
on	1
me."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
excellent.	1
I	1
think,	1
perhaps,	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
role	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
play."	1
	1
He	1
disappeared	1
into	1
his	1
bedroom	1
and	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
an	1
amiable	1
and	1
simple-minded	1
Nonconformist	1
clergyman.	1
His	1
broad	1
black	1
hat,	1
his	1
baggy	1
trousers,	1
his	1
white	1
tie,	1
his	1
sympathetic	1
smile,	1
and	1
general	1
look	1
of	1
peering	1
and	1
benevolent	1
curiosity	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Hare	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
equalled.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
that	1
Holmes	1
changed	1
his	1
costume.	1
His	1
expression,	1
his	1
manner,	1
his	1
very	1
soul	1
seemed	1
to	1
vary	1
with	1
every	1
fresh	1
part	1
that	1
he	1
assumed.	1
The	1
stage	1
lost	1
a	1
fine	1
actor,	1
even	1
as	1
science	1
lost	1
an	1
acute	1
reasoner,	1
when	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
specialist	1
in	1
crime.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quarter	1
past	1
six	1
when	1
we	1
left	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
and	1
it	1
still	1
wanted	1
ten	1
minutes	1
to	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
dusk,	1
and	1
the	1
lamps	1
were	1
just	1
being	1
lighted	1
as	1
we	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
its	1
occupant.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
pictured	1
it	1
from	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
succinct	1
description,	1
but	1
the	1
locality	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
private	1
than	1
I	1
expected.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
for	1
a	1
small	1
street	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
neighbourhood,	1
it	1
was	1
remarkably	1
animated.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
shabbily	1
dressed	1
men	1
smoking	1
and	1
laughing	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
a	1
scissors-grinder	1
with	1
his	1
wheel,	1
two	1
guardsmen	1
who	1
were	1
flirting	1
with	1
a	1
nurse-girl,	1
and	1
several	1
well-dressed	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
lounging	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
with	1
cigars	1
in	1
their	1
mouths.	1
	1
"You	1
see,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
we	1
paced	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
"this	1
marriage	1
rather	1
simplifies	1
matters.	1
The	1
photograph	1
becomes	1
a	1
double-edged	1
weapon	1
now.	1
The	1
chances	1
are	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
averse	1
to	1
its	1
being	1
seen	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Godfrey	1
Norton,	1
as	1
our	1
client	1
is	1
to	1
its	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
princess.	1
Now	1
the	1
question	1
is,	1
Where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"Where,	1
indeed?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
most	1
unlikely	1
that	1
she	1
carries	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
cabinet	1
size.	1
Too	1
large	1
for	1
easy	1
concealment	1
about	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress.	1
She	1
knows	1
that	1
the	1
King	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
having	1
her	1
waylaid	1
and	1
searched.	1
Two	1
attempts	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
made.	1
We	1
may	1
take	1
it,	1
then,	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
carry	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
her."	1
	1
"Where,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Her	1
banker	1
or	1
her	1
lawyer.	1
There	1
is	1
that	1
double	1
possibility.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
neither.	1
Women	1
are	1
naturally	1
secretive,	1
and	1
they	1
like	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
secreting.	1
Why	1
should	1
she	1
hand	1
it	1
over	1
to	1
anyone	1
else?	1
She	1
could	1
trust	1
her	1
own	1
guardianship,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
what	1
indirect	1
or	1
political	1
influence	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
a	1
business	1
man.	1
Besides,	1
remember	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
resolved	1
to	1
use	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
where	1
she	1
can	1
lay	1
her	1
hands	1
upon	1
it.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
has	1
twice	1
been	1
burgled."	1
	1
"Pshaw!	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
look."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
will	1
you	1
look?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
look."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
get	1
her	1
to	1
show	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
she	1
will	1
refuse."	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to.	1
But	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
wheels.	1
It	1
is	1
her	1
carriage.	1
Now	1
carry	1
out	1
my	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
letter."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
the	1
side-lights	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
came	1
round	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
the	1
avenue.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
smart	1
little	1
landau	1
which	1
rattled	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
As	1
it	1
pulled	1
up,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
loafing	1
men	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
dashed	1
forward	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
earning	1
a	1
copper,	1
but	1
was	1
elbowed	1
away	1
by	1
another	1
loafer,	1
who	1
had	1
rushed	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
intention.	1
A	1
fierce	1
quarrel	1
broke	1
out,	1
which	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
guardsmen,	1
who	1
took	1
sides	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
loungers,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scissors-grinder,	1
who	1
was	1
equally	1
hot	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
A	1
blow	1
was	1
struck,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
lady,	1
who	1
had	1
stepped	1
from	1
her	1
carriage,	1
was	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
flushed	1
and	1
struggling	1
men,	1
who	1
struck	1
savagely	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
their	1
fists	1
and	1
sticks.	1
Holmes	1
dashed	1
into	1
the	1
crowd	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
lady;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
her	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
and	1
dropped	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
running	1
freely	1
down	1
his	1
face.	1
At	1
his	1
fall	1
the	1
guardsmen	1
took	1
to	1
their	1
heels	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
and	1
the	1
loungers	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
while	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
better-dressed	1
people,	1
who	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
scuffle	1
without	1
taking	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
crowded	1
in	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
lady	1
and	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
injured	1
man.	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
as	1
I	1
will	1
still	1
call	1
her,	1
had	1
hurried	1
up	1
the	1
steps;	1
but	1
she	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
with	1
her	1
superb	1
figure	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
looking	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
much	1
hurt?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
dead,"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
there's	1
life	1
in	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
another.	1
"But	1
he'll	1
be	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
hospital."	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
brave	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
a	1
woman.	1
"They	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
lady's	1
purse	1
and	1
watch	1
if	1
it	1
hadn't	1
been	1
for	1
him.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
gang,	1
and	1
a	1
rough	1
one,	1
too.	1
Ah,	1
he's	1
breathing	1
now."	1
	1
"He	1
can't	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
May	1
we	1
bring	1
him	1
in,	1
marm?"	1
	1
"Surely.	1
Bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
comfortable	1
sofa.	1
This	1
way,	1
please!"	1
	1
Slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
into	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
and	1
laid	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
principal	1
room,	1
while	1
I	1
still	1
observed	1
the	1
proceedings	1
from	1
my	1
post	1
by	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
lamps	1
had	1
been	1
lit,	1
but	1
the	1
blinds	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
drawn,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
Holmes	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
couch.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
compunction	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
for	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
was	1
playing,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
felt	1
more	1
heartily	1
ashamed	1
of	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
against	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
conspiring,	1
or	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
kindliness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
waited	1
upon	1
the	1
injured	1
man.	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
blackest	1
treachery	1
to	1
Holmes	1
to	1
draw	1
back	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
intrusted	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
hardened	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
smoke-rocket	1
from	1
under	1
my	1
ulster.	1
After	1
all,	1
I	1
thought,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
injuring	1
her.	1
We	1
are	1
but	1
preventing	1
her	1
from	1
injuring	1
another.	1
	1
Holmes	1
had	1
sat	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
couch,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
motion	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
air.	1
A	1
maid	1
rushed	1
across	1
and	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
window.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
raise	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
signal	1
I	1
tossed	1
my	1
rocket	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"Fire!"	1
The	1
word	1
was	1
no	1
sooner	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth	1
than	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
of	1
spectators,	1
well	1
dressed	1
and	1
ill--gentlemen,	1
ostlers,	1
and	1
servant-maids--joined	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
shriek	1
of	1
"Fire!"	1
Thick	1
clouds	1
of	1
smoke	1
curled	1
through	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
window.	1
I	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
rushing	1
figures,	1
and	1
a	1
moment	1
later	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Holmes	1
from	1
within	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
false	1
alarm.	1
Slipping	1
through	1
the	1
shouting	1
crowd	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
friend's	1
arm	1
in	1
mine,	1
and	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
uproar.	1
He	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
few	1
minutes	1
until	1
we	1
had	1
turned	1
down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
streets	1
which	1
lead	1
towards	1
the	1
Edgeware	1
Road.	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
nicely,	1
Doctor,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"Nothing	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
better.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
the	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
where	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
out?"	1
	1
"She	1
showed	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
she	1
would."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
mystery,"	1
said	1
he,	1
laughing.	1
"The	1
matter	1
was	1
perfectly	1
simple.	1
You,	1
of	1
course,	1
saw	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
was	1
an	1
accomplice.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
engaged	1
for	1
the	1
evening."	1
	1
"I	1
guessed	1
as	1
much."	1
	1
"Then,	1
when	1
the	1
row	1
broke	1
out,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
moist	1
red	1
paint	1
in	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
I	1
rushed	1
forward,	1
fell	1
down,	1
clapped	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
piteous	1
spectacle.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
trick."	1
	1
"That	1
also	1
I	1
could	1
fathom."	1
	1
"Then	1
they	1
carried	1
me	1
in.	1
She	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
have	1
me	1
in.	1
What	1
else	1
could	1
she	1
do?	1
And	1
into	1
her	1
sitting-room,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
room	1
which	1
I	1
suspected.	1
It	1
lay	1
between	1
that	1
and	1
her	1
bedroom,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
which.	1
They	1
laid	1
me	1
on	1
a	1
couch,	1
I	1
motioned	1
for	1
air,	1
they	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
you	1
had	1
your	1
chance."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
that	1
help	1
you?"	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
all-important.	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
thinks	1
that	1
her	1
house	1
is	1
on	1
fire,	1
her	1
instinct	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
rush	1
to	1
the	1
thing	1
which	1
she	1
values	1
most.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
perfectly	1
overpowering	1
impulse,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
taken	1
advantage	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Darlington	1
substitution	1
scandal	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
Arnsworth	1
Castle	1
business.	1
A	1
married	1
woman	1
grabs	1
at	1
her	1
baby;	1
an	1
unmarried	1
one	1
reaches	1
for	1
her	1
jewel-box.	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
lady	1
of	1
to-day	1
had	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
more	1
precious	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
quest	1
of.	1
She	1
would	1
rush	1
to	1
secure	1
it.	1
The	1
alarm	1
of	1
fire	1
was	1
admirably	1
done.	1
The	1
smoke	1
and	1
shouting	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
shake	1
nerves	1
of	1
steel.	1
She	1
responded	1
beautifully.	1
The	1
photograph	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
recess	1
behind	1
a	1
sliding	1
panel	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
right	1
bell-pull.	1
She	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
I	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
half-drew	1
it	1
out.	1
When	1
I	1
cried	1
out	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
false	1
alarm,	1
she	1
replaced	1
it,	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
rocket,	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
since.	1
I	1
rose,	1
and,	1
making	1
my	1
excuses,	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
hesitated	1
whether	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
photograph	1
at	1
once;	1
but	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
watching	1
me	1
narrowly	1
it	1
seemed	1
safer	1
to	1
wait.	1
A	1
little	1
over-precipitance	1
may	1
ruin	1
all."	1
	1
"And	1
now?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Our	1
quest	1
is	1
practically	1
finished.	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
with	1
the	1
King	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
with	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
us.	1
We	1
will	1
be	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
lady,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
comes	1
she	1
may	1
find	1
neither	1
us	1
nor	1
the	1
photograph.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty	1
to	1
regain	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands."	1
	1
"And	1
when	1
will	1
you	1
call?"	1
	1
"At	1
eight	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
She	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
up,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
field.	1
Besides,	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
prompt,	1
for	1
this	1
marriage	1
may	1
mean	1
a	1
complete	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
and	1
habits.	1
I	1
must	1
wire	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
without	1
delay."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
reached	1
Baker	1
Street	1
and	1
had	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
was	1
searching	1
his	1
pockets	1
for	1
the	1
key	1
when	1
someone	1
passing	1
said:	1
	1
"Good-night,	1
Mister	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes."	1
	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
the	1
greeting	1
appeared	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
slim	1
youth	1
in	1
an	1
ulster	1
who	1
had	1
hurried	1
by.	1
	1
"I've	1
heard	1
that	1
voice	1
before,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
staring	1
down	1
the	1
dimly	1
lit	1
street.	1
"Now,	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
the	1
deuce	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been."	1
	1
	1
III.	1
	1
I	1
slept	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
engaged	1
upon	1
our	1
toast	1
and	1
coffee	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
when	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
really	1
got	1
it!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
grasping	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
by	1
either	1
shoulder	1
and	1
looking	1
eagerly	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Not	1
yet."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
hopes."	1
	1
"Then,	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
impatience	1
to	1
be	1
gone."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
cab."	1
	1
"No,	1
my	1
brougham	1
is	1
waiting."	1
	1
"Then	1
that	1
will	1
simplify	1
matters."	1
We	1
descended	1
and	1
started	1
off	1
once	1
more	1
for	1
Briony	1
Lodge.	1
	1
"Irene	1
Adler	1
is	1
married,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Married!	1
When?"	1
	1
"Yesterday."	1
	1
"But	1
to	1
whom?"	1
	1
"To	1
an	1
English	1
lawyer	1
named	1
Norton."	1
	1
"But	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
she	1
does."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
in	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"Because	1
it	1
would	1
spare	1
your	1
Majesty	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
future	1
annoyance.	1
If	1
the	1
lady	1
loves	1
her	1
husband,	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
If	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
your	1
Majesty,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
she	1
should	1
interfere	1
with	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
plan."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true.	1
And	1
yet--Well!	1
I	1
wish	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
station!	1
What	1
a	1
queen	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
made!"	1
He	1
relapsed	1
into	1
a	1
moody	1
silence,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
broken	1
until	1
we	1
drew	1
up	1
in	1
Serpentine	1
Avenue.	1
	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
Briony	1
Lodge	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
an	1
elderly	1
woman	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
steps.	1
She	1
watched	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
sardonic	1
eye	1
as	1
we	1
stepped	1
from	1
the	1
brougham.	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
believe?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
answered	1
my	1
companion,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
questioning	1
and	1
rather	1
startled	1
gaze.	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
My	1
mistress	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
call.	1
She	1
left	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
by	1
the	1
5:15	1
train	1
from	1
Charing	1
Cross	1
for	1
the	1
Continent."	1
	1
"What!"	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
staggered	1
back,	1
white	1
with	1
chagrin	1
and	1
surprise.	1
"Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
left	1
England?"	1
	1
"Never	1
to	1
return."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
papers?"	1
asked	1
the	1
King	1
hoarsely.	1
"All	1
is	1
lost."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
see."	1
He	1
pushed	1
past	1
the	1
servant	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
myself.	1
The	1
furniture	1
was	1
scattered	1
about	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
with	1
dismantled	1
shelves	1
and	1
open	1
drawers,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
hurriedly	1
ransacked	1
them	1
before	1
her	1
flight.	1
Holmes	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
bell-pull,	1
tore	1
back	1
a	1
small	1
sliding	1
shutter,	1
and,	1
plunging	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
photograph	1
and	1
a	1
letter.	1
The	1
photograph	1
was	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
herself	1
in	1
evening	1
dress,	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
superscribed	1
to	1
"Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
Esq.	1
To	1
be	1
left	1
till	1
called	1
for."	1
My	1
friend	1
tore	1
it	1
open	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
three	1
read	1
it	1
together.	1
It	1
was	1
dated	1
at	1
midnight	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
night	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
MR.	1
SHERLOCK	1
HOLMES,--You	1
really	1
did	1
it	1
very	1
well.	1
You	1
took	1
me	1
in	1
completely.	1
Until	1
after	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
fire,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
suspicion.	1
But	1
then,	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
how	1
I	1
had	1
betrayed	1
myself,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
think.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
warned	1
against	1
you	1
months	1
ago.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
King	1
employed	1
an	1
agent	1
it	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
you.	1
And	1
your	1
address	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
me.	1
Yet,	1
with	1
all	1
this,	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
reveal	1
what	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
know.	1
Even	1
after	1
I	1
became	1
suspicious,	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
evil	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
dear,	1
kind	1
old	1
clergyman.	1
But,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
trained	1
as	1
an	1
actress	1
myself.	1
Male	1
costume	1
is	1
nothing	1
new	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
often	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
freedom	1
which	1
it	1
gives.	1
I	1
sent	1
John,	1
the	1
coachman,	1
to	1
watch	1
you,	1
ran	1
up	1
stairs,	1
got	1
into	1
my	1
walking-clothes,	1
as	1
I	1
call	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
departed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
followed	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
door,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
really	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
Then	1
I,	1
rather	1
imprudently,	1
wished	1
you	1
good-night,	1
and	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Temple	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
husband.	1
	1
"We	1
both	1
thought	1
the	1
best	1
resource	1
was	1
flight,	1
when	1
pursued	1
by	1
so	1
formidable	1
an	1
antagonist;	1
so	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
nest	1
empty	1
when	1
you	1
call	1
to-morrow.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
photograph,	1
your	1
client	1
may	1
rest	1
in	1
peace.	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
am	1
loved	1
by	1
a	1
better	1
man	1
than	1
he.	1
The	1
King	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
without	1
hindrance	1
from	1
one	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
cruelly	1
wronged.	1
I	1
keep	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
safeguard	1
myself,	1
and	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
weapon	1
which	1
will	1
always	1
secure	1
me	1
from	1
any	1
steps	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
I	1
leave	1
a	1
photograph	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
care	1
to	1
possess;	1
and	1
I	1
remain,	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
	1
	1

"IRENE	1
NORTON,	1
née	1
ADLER."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
woman--oh,	1
what	1
a	1
woman!"	1
cried	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
all	1
three	1
read	1
this	1
epistle.	1
"Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
quick	1
and	1
resolute	1
she	1
was?	1
Would	1
she	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
admirable	1
queen?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
my	1
level?"	1
	1
"From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
she	1
seems	1
indeed	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
level	1
to	1
your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
Majesty's	1
business	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
successful	1
conclusion."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
the	1
King;	1
"nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
successful.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
word	1
is	1
inviolate.	1
The	1
photograph	1
is	1
now	1
as	1
safe	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fire."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
Majesty	1
say	1
so."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
immensely	1
indebted	1
to	1
you.	1
Pray	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
I	1
can	1
reward	1
you.	1
This	1
ring--"	1
He	1
slipped	1
an	1
emerald	1
snake	1
ring	1
from	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"Your	1
Majesty	1
has	1
something	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
value	1
even	1
more	1
highly,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
but	1
to	1
name	1
it."	1
	1
"This	1
photograph!"	1
	1
The	1
King	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
amazement.	1
	1
"Irene's	1
photograph!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Certainly,	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
your	1
Majesty.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
wish	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
good-morning."	1
He	1
bowed,	1
and,	1
turning	1
away	1
without	1
observing	1
the	1
hand	1
which	1
the	1
King	1
had	1
stretched	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
my	1
company	1
for	1
his	1
chambers.	1
	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
a	1
great	1
scandal	1
threatened	1
to	1
affect	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
best	1
plans	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
were	1
beaten	1
by	1
a	1
woman's	1
wit.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
over	1
the	1
cleverness	1
of	1
women,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
of	1
late.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
speaks	1
of	1
Irene	1
Adler,	1
or	1
when	1
he	1
refers	1
to	1
her	1
photograph,	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
under	1
the	1
honourable	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
woman.	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
II.	1
THE	1
RED-HEADED	1
LEAGUE	1
	1
I	1
had	1
called	1
upon	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
last	1
year	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
deep	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
stout,	1
florid-faced,	1
elderly	1
gentleman	1
with	1
fiery	1
red	1
hair.	1
With	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
my	1
intrusion,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
withdraw	1
when	1
Holmes	1
pulled	1
me	1
abruptly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
me.	1
	1
"You	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
come	1
at	1
a	1
better	1
time,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
cordially.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
engaged."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
am.	1
Very	1
much	1
so."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
can	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
This	1
gentleman,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
partner	1
and	1
helper	1
in	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
successful	1
cases,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
yours	1
also."	1
	1
The	1
stout	1
gentleman	1
half	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
bob	1
of	1
greeting,	1
with	1
a	1
quick	1
little	1
questioning	1
glance	1
from	1
his	1
small	1
fat-encircled	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Try	1
the	1
settee,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
relapsing	1
into	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
fingertips	1
together,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
in	1
judicial	1
moods.	1
"I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
share	1
my	1
love	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
bizarre	1
and	1
outside	1
the	1
conventions	1
and	1
humdrum	1
routine	1
of	1
everyday	1
life.	1
You	1
have	1
shown	1
your	1
relish	1
for	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
which	1
has	1
prompted	1
you	1
to	1
chronicle,	1
and,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
somewhat	1
to	1
embellish	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
adventures."	1
	1
"Your	1
cases	1
have	1
indeed	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
interest	1
to	1
me,"	1
I	1
observed.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
remarked	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
just	1
before	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
simple	1
problem	1
presented	1
by	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
that	1
for	1
strange	1
effects	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
combinations	1
we	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
life	1
itself,	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
far	1
more	1
daring	1
than	1
any	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
imagination."	1
	1
"A	1
proposition	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
doubting."	1
	1
"You	1
did,	1
Doctor,	1
but	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
my	1
view,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
on	1
piling	1
fact	1
upon	1
fact	1
on	1
you	1
until	1
your	1
reason	1
breaks	1
down	1
under	1
them	1
and	1
acknowledges	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
right.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
here	1
has	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
narrative	1
which	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
You	1
have	1
heard	1
me	1
remark	1
that	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
unique	1
things	1
are	1
very	1
often	1
connected	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
larger	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
smaller	1
crimes,	1
and	1
occasionally,	1
indeed,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
room	1
for	1
doubt	1
whether	1
any	1
positive	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
committed.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
whether	1
the	1
present	1
case	1
is	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
crime	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
is	1
certainly	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to.	1
Perhaps,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
kindness	1
to	1
recommence	1
your	1
narrative.	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
not	1
merely	1
because	1
my	1
friend	1
Dr.	1
Watson	1
has	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
opening	1
part	1
but	1
also	1
because	1
the	1
peculiar	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
makes	1
me	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
every	1
possible	1
detail	1
from	1
your	1
lips.	1
As	1
a	1
rule,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
some	1
slight	1
indication	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
guide	1
myself	1
by	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
similar	1
cases	1
which	1
occur	1
to	1
my	1
memory.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
instance	1
I	1
am	1
forced	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
facts	1
are,	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
belief,	1
unique."	1
	1
The	1
portly	1
client	1
puffed	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
pride	1
and	1
pulled	1
a	1
dirty	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
inside	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
greatcoat.	1
As	1
he	1
glanced	1
down	1
the	1
advertisement	1
column,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
thrust	1
forward	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
flattened	1
out	1
upon	1
his	1
knee,	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
endeavoured,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
my	1
companion,	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
indications	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
presented	1
by	1
his	1
dress	1
or	1
appearance.	1
	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
gain	1
very	1
much,	1
however,	1
by	1
my	1
inspection.	1
Our	1
visitor	1
bore	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
average	1
commonplace	1
British	1
tradesman,	1
obese,	1
pompous,	1
and	1
slow.	1
He	1
wore	1
rather	1
baggy	1
grey	1
shepherd's	1
check	1
trousers,	1
a	1
not	1
over-clean	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
unbuttoned	1
in	1
the	1
front,	1
and	1
a	1
drab	1
waistcoat	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
brassy	1
Albert	1
chain,	1
and	1
a	1
square	1
pierced	1
bit	1
of	1
metal	1
dangling	1
down	1
as	1
an	1
ornament.	1
A	1
frayed	1
top-hat	1
and	1
a	1
faded	1
brown	1
overcoat	1
with	1
a	1
wrinkled	1
velvet	1
collar	1
lay	1
upon	1
a	1
chair	1
beside	1
him.	1
Altogether,	1
look	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
about	1
the	1
man	1
save	1
his	1
blazing	1
red	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
extreme	1
chagrin	1
and	1
discontent	1
upon	1
his	1
features.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
quick	1
eye	1
took	1
in	1
my	1
occupation,	1
and	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
as	1
he	1
noticed	1
my	1
questioning	1
glances.	1
"Beyond	1
the	1
obvious	1
facts	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
some	1
time	1
done	1
manual	1
labour,	1
that	1
he	1
takes	1
snuff,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Freemason,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
China,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
a	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
writing	1
lately,	1
I	1
can	1
deduce	1
nothing	1
else."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
started	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
forefinger	1
upon	1
the	1
paper,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"How,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
good-fortune,	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
know,	1
for	1
example,	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
manual	1
labour.	1
It's	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
gospel,	1
for	1
I	1
began	1
as	1
a	1
ship's	1
carpenter."	1
	1
"Your	1
hands,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
Your	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
size	1
larger	1
than	1
your	1
left.	1
You	1
have	1
worked	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
muscles	1
are	1
more	1
developed."	1
	1
"Well,	1
the	1
snuff,	1
then,	1
and	1
the	1
Freemasonry?"	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
insult	1
your	1
intelligence	1
by	1
telling	1
you	1
how	1
I	1
read	1
that,	1
especially	1
as,	1
rather	1
against	1
the	1
strict	1
rules	1
of	1
your	1
order,	1
you	1
use	1
an	1
arc-and-compass	1
breastpin."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
forgot	1
that.	1
But	1
the	1
writing?"	1
	1
"What	1
else	1
can	1
be	1
indicated	1
by	1
that	1
right	1
cuff	1
so	1
very	1
shiny	1
for	1
five	1
inches,	1
and	1
the	1
left	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
smooth	1
patch	1
near	1
the	1
elbow	1
where	1
you	1
rest	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
desk?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
but	1
China?"	1
	1
"The	1
fish	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
tattooed	1
immediately	1
above	1
your	1
right	1
wrist	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
China.	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
small	1
study	1
of	1
tattoo	1
marks	1
and	1
have	1
even	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
That	1
trick	1
of	1
staining	1
the	1
fishes'	1
scales	1
of	1
a	1
delicate	1
pink	1
is	1
quite	1
peculiar	1
to	1
China.	1
When,	1
in	1
addition,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
Chinese	1
coin	1
hanging	1
from	1
your	1
watch-chain,	1
the	1
matter	1
becomes	1
even	1
more	1
simple."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson	1
laughed	1
heavily.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
never!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
thought	1
at	1
first	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
done	1
something	1
clever,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"I	1
begin	1
to	1
think,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
explaining.	1
'Omne	1
ignotum	1
pro	1
magnifico,'	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
my	1
poor	1
little	1
reputation,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
will	1
suffer	1
shipwreck	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
candid.	1
Can	1
you	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
now,"	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
his	1
thick	1
red	1
finger	1
planted	1
halfway	1
down	1
the	1
column.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
began	1
it	1
all.	1
You	1
just	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
yourself,	1
sir."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
paper	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"TO	1
THE	1
RED-HEADED	1
LEAGUE:	1
On	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
bequest	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Ezekiah	1
Hopkins,	1
of	1
Lebanon,	1
Pennsylvania,	1
U.	1
S.	1
A.,	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
another	1
vacancy	1
open	1
which	1
entitles	1
a	1

of	1
the	1

to	1
a	1
salary	1
of	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1

for	1
purely	1
nominal	1

All	1
red-headed	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
sound	1
in	1
body	1
and	1

Fleet	1
Street."	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
does	1
this	1
mean?"	1
I	1
ejaculated	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
twice	1
read	1
over	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
announcement.	1
	1
Holmes	1
chuckled	1
and	1
wriggled	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit	1
when	1
in	1
high	1
spirits.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
off	1
the	1
beaten	1
track,	1
isn't	1
it?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
off	1
you	1
go	1
at	1
scratch	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
yourself,	1
your	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
this	1
advertisement	1
had	1
upon	1
your	1
fortunes.	1
You	1
will	1
first	1
make	1
a	1
note,	1
Doctor,	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
the	1
date."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
The	1
Morning	1
Chronicle	1
of	1
April	1
27,	1
1890.	1
Just	1
two	1
months	1
ago."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Now,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,	1
mopping	1
his	1
forehead;	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
pawnbroker's	1
business	1
at	1
Coburg	1
Square,	1
near	1
the	1
City.	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
affair,	1
and	1
of	1
late	1
years	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
more	1
than	1
just	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
living.	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
two	1
assistants,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
only	1
keep	1
one;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
job	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
come	1
for	1
half	1
wages	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
business."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
obliging	1
youth?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"His	1
name	1
is	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding,	1
and	1
he's	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
youth,	1
either.	1
It's	1
hard	1
to	1
say	1
his	1
age.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
wish	1
a	1
smarter	1
assistant,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
better	1
himself	1
and	1
earn	1
twice	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
him.	1
But,	1
after	1
all,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
satisfied,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
put	1
ideas	1
in	1
his	1
head?"	1
	1
"Why,	1
indeed?	1
You	1
seem	1
most	1
fortunate	1
in	1
having	1
an	1
employé	1
who	1
comes	1
under	1
the	1
full	1
market	1
price.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
common	1
experience	1
among	1
employers	1
in	1
this	1
age.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
assistant	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
remarkable	1
as	1
your	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
faults,	1
too,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
"Never	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
for	1
photography.	1
Snapping	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
camera	1
when	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
improving	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
then	1
diving	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cellar	1
like	1
a	1
rabbit	1
into	1
its	1
hole	1
to	1
develop	1
his	1
pictures.	1
That	1
is	1
his	1
main	1
fault,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
he's	1
a	1
good	1
worker.	1
There's	1
no	1
vice	1
in	1
him."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
still	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
He	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
who	1
does	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
simple	1
cooking	1
and	1
keeps	1
the	1
place	1
clean--that's	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
widower	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
family.	1
We	1
live	1
very	1
quietly,	1
sir,	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us;	1
and	1
we	1
keep	1
a	1
roof	1
over	1
our	1
heads	1
and	1
pay	1
our	1
debts,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
nothing	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
put	1
us	1
out	1
was	1
that	1
advertisement.	1
Spaulding,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
office	1
just	1
this	1
day	1
eight	1
weeks,	1
with	1
this	1
very	1
paper	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
says:	1
	1
"'I	1
wish	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
red-headed	1
man.'	1
	1
"'Why	1
that?'	1
I	1
asks.	1
	1
"'Why,'	1
says	1
he,	1
'here's	1
another	1
vacancy	1
on	1
the	1
League	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
Men.	1
It's	1
worth	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
fortune	1
to	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
gets	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
vacancies	1
than	1
there	1
are	1
men,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
trustees	1
are	1
at	1
their	1
wits'	1
end	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
money.	1
If	1
my	1
hair	1
would	1
only	1
change	1
colour,	1
here's	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
crib	1
all	1
ready	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
step	1
into.'	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
is	1
it,	1
then?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
You	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
very	1
stay-at-home	1
man,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
business	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
instead	1
of	1
my	1
having	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
often	1
weeks	1
on	1
end	1
without	1
putting	1
my	1
foot	1
over	1
the	1
door-mat.	1
In	1
that	1
way	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
outside,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
news.	1
	1
"'Have	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
League	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
Men?'	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
open.	1
	1
"'Never.'	1
	1
"'Why,	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
that,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
eligible	1
yourself	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
vacancies.'	1
	1
"'And	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
worth?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
merely	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
the	1
work	1
is	1
slight,	1
and	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
interfere	1
very	1
much	1
with	1
one's	1
other	1
occupations.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
easily	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
prick	1
up	1
my	1
ears,	1
for	1
the	1
business	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
over-good	1
for	1
some	1
years,	1
and	1
an	1
extra	1
couple	1
of	1
hundred	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
handy.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
he,	1
showing	1
me	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
'you	1
can	1
see	1
for	1
yourself	1
that	1
the	1
League	1
has	1
a	1
vacancy,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
address	1
where	1
you	1
should	1
apply	1
for	1
particulars.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out,	1
the	1
League	1
was	1
founded	1
by	1
an	1
American	1
millionaire,	1
Ezekiah	1
Hopkins,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
peculiar	1
in	1
his	1
ways.	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
red-headed,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
sympathy	1
for	1
all	1
red-headed	1
men;	1
so	1
when	1
he	1
died	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
enormous	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
trustees,	1
with	1
instructions	1
to	1
apply	1
the	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
providing	1
of	1
easy	1
berths	1
to	1
men	1
whose	1
hair	1
is	1
of	1
that	1
colour.	1
From	1
all	1
I	1
hear	1
it	1
is	1
splendid	1
pay	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'But,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'there	1
would	1
be	1
millions	1
of	1
red-headed	1
men	1
who	1
would	1
apply.'	1
	1
"'Not	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
you	1
might	1
think,'	1
he	1
answered.	1
'You	1
see	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
confined	1
to	1
Londoners,	1
and	1
to	1
grown	1
men.	1
This	1
American	1
had	1
started	1
from	1
London	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young,	1
and	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
old	1
town	1
a	1
good	1
turn.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
your	1
applying	1
if	1
your	1
hair	1
is	1
light	1
red,	1
or	1
dark	1
red,	1
or	1
anything	1
but	1
real	1
bright,	1
blazing,	1
fiery	1
red.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
cared	1
to	1
apply,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson,	1
you	1
would	1
just	1
walk	1
in;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
hardly	1
be	1
worth	1
your	1
while	1
to	1
put	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
pounds.'	1
	1
"Now,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fact,	1
gentlemen,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
my	1
hair	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
full	1
and	1
rich	1
tint,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
competition	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
I	1
stood	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
as	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
met.	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
prove	1
useful,	1
so	1
I	1
just	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
shutters	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
right	1
away	1
with	1
me.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
holiday,	1
so	1
we	1
shut	1
the	1
business	1
up	1
and	1
started	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
address	1
that	1
was	1
given	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
advertisement.	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
as	1
that	1
again,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
From	1
north,	1
south,	1
east,	1
and	1
west	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
red	1
in	1
his	1
hair	1
had	1
tramped	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
advertisement.	1
Fleet	1
Street	1
was	1
choked	1
with	1
red-headed	1
folk,	1
and	1
Pope's	1
Court	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
coster's	1
orange	1
barrow.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
country	1
as	1
were	1
brought	1
together	1
by	1
that	1
single	1
advertisement.	1
Every	1
shade	1
of	1
colour	1
they	1
were--straw,	1
lemon,	1
orange,	1
brick,	1
Irish-setter,	1
liver,	1
clay;	1
but,	1
as	1
Spaulding	1
said,	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
real	1
vivid	1
flame-coloured	1
tint.	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
how	1
many	1
were	1
waiting,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
despair;	1
but	1
Spaulding	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
it.	1
How	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine,	1
but	1
he	1
pushed	1
and	1
pulled	1
and	1
butted	1
until	1
he	1
got	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
crowd,	1
and	1
right	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
office.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
stream	1
upon	1
the	1
stair,	1
some	1
going	1
up	1
in	1
hope,	1
and	1
some	1
coming	1
back	1
dejected;	1
but	1
we	1
wedged	1
in	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
and	1
soon	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
office."	1
	1
"Your	1
experience	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
most	1
entertaining	1
one,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
as	1
his	1
client	1
paused	1
and	1
refreshed	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff.	1
"Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
very	1
interesting	1
statement."	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
but	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
wooden	1
chairs	1
and	1
a	1
deal	1
table,	1
behind	1
which	1
sat	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
head	1
that	1
was	1
even	1
redder	1
than	1
mine.	1
He	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
each	1
candidate	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
always	1
managed	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
fault	1
in	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
disqualify	1
them.	1
Getting	1
a	1
vacancy	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
easy	1
matter,	1
after	1
all.	1
However,	1
when	1
our	1
turn	1
came	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
favourable	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
we	1
entered,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
private	1
word	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
"'This	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,'	1
said	1
my	1
assistant,	1
'and	1
he	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
fill	1
a	1
vacancy	1
in	1
the	1
League.'	1
	1
"'And	1
he	1
is	1
admirably	1
suited	1
for	1
it,'	1
the	1
other	1
answered.	1
'He	1
has	1
every	1
requirement.	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
anything	1
so	1
fine.'	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
backward,	1
cocked	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
my	1
hair	1
until	1
I	1
felt	1
quite	1
bashful.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
he	1
plunged	1
forward,	1
wrung	1
my	1
hand,	1
and	1
congratulated	1
me	1
warmly	1
on	1
my	1
success.	1
	1
"'It	1
would	1
be	1
injustice	1
to	1
hesitate,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'You	1
will,	1
however,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
taking	1
an	1
obvious	1
precaution.'	1
With	1
that	1
he	1
seized	1
my	1
hair	1
in	1
both	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
tugged	1
until	1
I	1
yelled	1
with	1
the	1
pain.	1
'There	1
is	1
water	1
in	1
your	1
eyes,'	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
released	1
me.	1
'I	1
perceive	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be.	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
careful,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
twice	1
been	1
deceived	1
by	1
wigs	1
and	1
once	1
by	1
paint.	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
tales	1
of	1
cobbler's	1
wax	1
which	1
would	1
disgust	1
you	1
with	1
human	1
nature.'	1
He	1
stepped	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
shouted	1
through	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
that	1
the	1
vacancy	1
was	1
filled.	1
A	1
groan	1
of	1
disappointment	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
below,	1
and	1
the	1
folk	1
all	1
trooped	1
away	1
in	1
different	1
directions	1
until	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
red-head	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
except	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
manager.	1
	1
"'My	1
name,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'is	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pensioners	1
upon	1
the	1
fund	1
left	1
by	1
our	1
noble	1
benefactor.	1
Are	1
you	1
a	1
married	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson?	1
Have	1
you	1
a	1
family?'	1
	1
"I	1
answered	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not.	1
	1
"His	1
face	1
fell	1
immediately.	1
	1
"'Dear	1
me!'	1
he	1
said	1
gravely,	1
'that	1
is	1
very	1
serious	1
indeed!	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
say	1
that.	1
The	1
fund	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
the	1
propagation	1
and	1
spread	1
of	1
the	1
red-heads	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
their	1
maintenance.	1
It	1
is	1
exceedingly	1
unfortunate	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
bachelor.'	1
	1
"My	1
face	1
lengthened	1
at	1
this,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
vacancy	1
after	1
all;	1
but	1
after	1
thinking	1
it	1
over	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
right.	1
	1
"'In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
another,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'the	1
objection	1
might	1
be	1
fatal,	1
but	1
we	1
must	1
stretch	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
head	1
of	1
hair	1
as	1
yours.	1
When	1
shall	1
you	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
upon	1
your	1
new	1
duties?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
awkward,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
business	1
already,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
never	1
mind	1
about	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson!'	1
said	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding.	1
'I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
that	1
for	1
you.'	1
	1
"'What	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
hours?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Ten	1
to	1
two.'	1
	1
"Now	1
a	1
pawnbroker's	1
business	1
is	1
mostly	1
done	1
of	1
an	1
evening,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
especially	1
Thursday	1
and	1
Friday	1
evening,	1
which	1
is	1
just	1
before	1
pay-day;	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
suit	1
me	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
mornings.	1
Besides,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
assistant	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
to	1
anything	1
that	1
turned	1
up.	1
	1
"'That	1
would	1
suit	1
me	1
very	1
well,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'And	1
the	1
pay?'	1
	1
"'Is	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1

	1
"'And	1
the	1
work?'	1
	1
"'Is	1
purely	1
nominal.'	1
	1
"'What	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
purely	1
nominal?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
office,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
building,	1
the	1
whole	1
time.	1
If	1
you	1
leave,	1
you	1
forfeit	1
your	1
whole	1
position	1
forever.	1
The	1
will	1
is	1
very	1
clear	1
upon	1
that	1
point.	1
You	1
don't	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1

	1
"'It's	1
only	1
four	1
hours	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
leaving,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'No	1
excuse	1
will	1
avail,'	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross;	1
'neither	1
sickness	1
nor	1
business	1
nor	1
anything	1
else.	1
There	1
you	1
must	1
stay,	1
or	1
you	1
lose	1
your	1
billet.'	1
	1
"'And	1
the	1
work?'	1
	1
"'Is	1
to	1
copy	1
out	1
the	1
"Encyclopaedia	1
Britannica."	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
volume	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
press.	1
You	1
must	1
find	1
your	1
own	1
ink,	1
pens,	1
and	1
blotting-paper,	1
but	1
we	1
provide	1
this	1
table	1
and	1
chair.	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
ready	1
to-morrow?'	1
	1
"'Certainly,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'Then,	1
good-bye,	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
congratulate	1
you	1
once	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
important	1
position	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
gain.'	1
He	1
bowed	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
home	1
with	1
my	1
assistant,	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do,	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
pleased	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
good	1
fortune.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
thought	1
over	1
the	1
matter	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
by	1
evening	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
low	1
spirits	1
again;	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
quite	1
persuaded	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
great	1
hoax	1
or	1
fraud,	1
though	1
what	1
its	1
object	1
might	1
be	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine.	1
It	1
seemed	1
altogether	1
past	1
belief	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
will,	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
pay	1
such	1
a	1
sum	1
for	1
doing	1
anything	1
so	1
simple	1
as	1
copying	1
out	1
the	1
'Encyclopaedia	1
Britannica.'	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding	1
did	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
cheer	1
me	1
up,	1
but	1
by	1
bedtime	1
I	1
had	1
reasoned	1
myself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
thing.	1
However,	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
anyhow,	1
so	1
I	1
bought	1
a	1
penny	1
bottle	1
of	1
ink,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
quill-pen,	1
and	1
seven	1
sheets	1
of	1
foolscap	1
paper,	1
I	1
started	1
off	1
for	1
Pope's	1
Court.	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
and	1
delight,	1
everything	1
was	1
as	1
right	1
as	1
possible.	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
set	1
out	1
ready	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
fairly	1
to	1
work.	1
He	1
started	1
me	1
off	1
upon	1
the	1
letter	1
A,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
me;	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
drop	1
in	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
right	1
with	1
me.	1
At	1
two	1
o'clock	1
he	1
bade	1
me	1
good-day,	1
complimented	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
amount	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
written,	1
and	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
office	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
"This	1
went	1
on	1
day	1
after	1
day,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
on	1
Saturday	1
the	1
manager	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
planked	1
down	1
four	1
golden	1
sovereigns	1
for	1
my	1
week's	1
work.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
next	1
week,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
the	1
week	1
after.	1
Every	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
at	1
ten,	1
and	1
every	1
afternoon	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
two.	1
By	1
degrees	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
took	1
to	1
coming	1
in	1
only	1
once	1
of	1
a	1
morning,	1
and	1
then,	1
after	1
a	1
time,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
at	1
all.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
never	1
dared	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
come,	1
and	1
the	1
billet	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
suited	1
me	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
risk	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"Eight	1
weeks	1
passed	1
away	1
like	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
written	1
about	1
Abbots	1
and	1
Archery	1
and	1
Armour	1
and	1
Architecture	1
and	1
Attica,	1
and	1
hoped	1
with	1
diligence	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
get	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
B's	1
before	1
very	1
long.	1
It	1
cost	1
me	1
something	1
in	1
foolscap,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
pretty	1
nearly	1
filled	1
a	1
shelf	1
with	1
my	1
writings.	1
And	1
then	1
suddenly	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end."	1
	1
"To	1
an	1
end?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
And	1
no	1
later	1
than	1
this	1
morning.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
my	1
work	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock,	1
but	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
and	1
locked,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
square	1
of	1
cardboard	1
hammered	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
panel	1
with	1
a	1
tack.	1
Here	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
read	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
held	1
up	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
white	1
cardboard	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
note-paper.	1

October	1
9,	1
1890.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
surveyed	1
this	1
curt	1
announcement	1
and	1
the	1
rueful	1
face	1
behind	1
it,	1
until	1
the	1
comical	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
so	1
completely	1
overtopped	1
every	1
other	1
consideration	1
that	1
we	1
both	1
burst	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
laughter.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
very	1
funny,"	1
cried	1
our	1
client,	1
flushing	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
flaming	1
head.	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
laugh	1
at	1
me,	1
I	1
can	1
go	1
elsewhere."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,"	1
cried	1
Holmes,	1
shoving	1
him	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
chair	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
half	1
risen.	1
"I	1
really	1
wouldn't	1
miss	1
your	1
case	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
refreshingly	1
unusual.	1
But	1
there	1
is,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
something	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
funny	1
about	1
it.	1
Pray	1
what	1
steps	1
did	1
you	1
take	1
when	1
you	1
found	1
the	1
card	1
upon	1
the	1
door?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
staggered,	1
sir.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Then	1
I	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
offices	1
round,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
Finally,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
accountant	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
ground-floor,	1
and	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
body.	1
Then	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross	1
was.	1
He	1
answered	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
was	1
new	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'the	1
gentleman	1
at	1
No.	1
4.'	1
	1
"'What,	1
the	1
red-headed	1
man?'	1
	1
"'Yes.'	1
	1
"'Oh,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'his	1
name	1
was	1
William	1
Morris.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
solicitor	1
and	1
was	1
using	1
my	1
room	1
as	1
a	1
temporary	1
convenience	1
until	1
his	1
new	1
premises	1
were	1
ready.	1
He	1
moved	1
out	1
yesterday.'	1
	1
"'Where	1
could	1
I	1
find	1
him?'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
at	1
his	1
new	1
offices.	1
He	1
did	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
address.	1
Yes,	1
17	1
King	1
Edward	1
Street,	1
near	1
St.	1
Paul's.'	1
	1
"I	1
started	1
off,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
to	1
that	1
address	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
manufactory	1
of	1
artificial	1
knee-caps,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
either	1
Mr.	1
William	1
Morris	1
or	1
Mr.	1
Duncan	1
Ross."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
do	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"I	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
my	1
assistant.	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
me	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
waited	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
by	1
post.	1
But	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
good	1
enough,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
lose	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
without	1
a	1
struggle,	1
so,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
advice	1
to	1
poor	1
folk	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
did	1
very	1
wisely,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
case	1
is	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
remarkable	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
it.	1
From	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
graver	1
issues	1
hang	1
from	1
it	1
than	1
might	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
appear."	1
	1
"Grave	1
enough!"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
four	1
pound	1
a	1
week."	1
	1
"As	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
personally	1
concerned,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
grievance	1
against	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
league.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
you	1
are,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
richer	1
by	1
some	1
30	1
pounds,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
minute	1
knowledge	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
gained	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
which	1
comes	1
under	1
the	1
letter	1
A.	1
You	1
have	1
lost	1
nothing	1
by	1
them."	1
	1
"No,	1
sir.	1
But	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
who	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
what	1
their	1
object	1
was	1
in	1
playing	1
this	1
prank--if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
prank--upon	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
pretty	1
expensive	1
joke	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
cost	1
them	1
two	1
and	1
thirty	1
pounds."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
endeavour	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
these	1
points	1
for	1
you.	1
And,	1
first,	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
questions,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
This	1
assistant	1
of	1
yours	1
who	1
first	1
called	1
your	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
advertisement--how	1
long	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"About	1
a	1
month	1
then."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
he	1
come?"	1
	1
"In	1
answer	1
to	1
an	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"Was	1
he	1
the	1
only	1
applicant?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
dozen."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
pick	1
him?"	1
	1
"Because	1
he	1
was	1
handy	1
and	1
would	1
come	1
cheap."	1
	1
"At	1
half-wages,	1
in	1
fact."	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
he	1
like,	1
this	1
Vincent	1
Spaulding?"	1
	1
"Small,	1
stout-built,	1
very	1
quick	1
in	1
his	1
ways,	1
no	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
though	1
he's	1
not	1
short	1
of	1
thirty.	1
Has	1
a	1
white	1
splash	1
of	1
acid	1
upon	1
his	1
forehead."	1
	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
considerable	1
excitement.	1
"I	1
thought	1
as	1
much,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Have	1
you	1
ever	1
observed	1
that	1
his	1
ears	1
are	1
pierced	1
for	1
earrings?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
a	1
gipsy	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
lad."	1
	1
"Hum!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
sinking	1
back	1
in	1
deep	1
thought.	1
"He	1
is	1
still	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
sir;	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
left	1
him."	1
	1
"And	1
has	1
your	1
business	1
been	1
attended	1
to	1
in	1
your	1
absence?"	1
	1
"Nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of,	1
sir.	1
There's	1
never	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
of	1
a	1
morning."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Wilson.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
opinion	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
To-day	1
is	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
by	1
Monday	1
we	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion."	1
	1
"Well,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
when	1
our	1
visitor	1
had	1
left	1
us,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it	1
all?"	1
	1
"I	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
it,"	1
I	1
answered	1
frankly.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
mysterious	1
business."	1
	1
"As	1
a	1
rule,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"the	1
more	1
bizarre	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
less	1
mysterious	1
it	1
proves	1
to	1
be.	1
It	1
is	1
your	1
commonplace,	1
featureless	1
crimes	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
puzzling,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
commonplace	1
face	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
to	1
identify.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
prompt	1
over	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do,	1
then?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"To	1
smoke,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
three	1
pipe	1
problem,	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
fifty	1
minutes."	1
He	1
curled	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
knees	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
hawk-like	1
nose,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
black	1
clay	1
pipe	1
thrusting	1
out	1
like	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
some	1
strange	1
bird.	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
dropped	1
asleep,	1
and	1
indeed	1
was	1
nodding	1
myself,	1
when	1
he	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
pipe	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
	1
"Sarasate	1
plays	1
at	1
the	1
St.	1
James's	1
Hall	1
this	1
afternoon,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Watson?	1
Could	1
your	1
patients	1
spare	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
to-day.	1
My	1
practice	1
is	1
never	1
very	1
absorbing."	1
	1
"Then	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
hat	1
and	1
come.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
City	1
first,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
some	1
lunch	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
German	1
music	1
on	1
the	1
programme,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
than	1
Italian	1
or	1
French.	1
It	1
is	1
introspective,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
introspect.	1
Come	1
along!"	1
	1
We	1
travelled	1
by	1
the	1
Underground	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Aldersgate;	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
walk	1
took	1
us	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
story	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
poky,	1
little,	1
shabby-genteel	1
place,	1
where	1
four	1
lines	1
of	1
dingy	1
two-storied	1
brick	1
houses	1
looked	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
railed-in	1
enclosure,	1
where	1
a	1
lawn	1
of	1
weedy	1
grass	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
clumps	1
of	1
faded	1
laurel-bushes	1
made	1
a	1
hard	1
fight	1
against	1
a	1
smoke-laden	1
and	1
uncongenial	1
atmosphere.	1
Three	1
gilt	1
balls	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
board	1
with	1
"JABEZ	1
WILSON"	1
in	1
white	1
letters,	1
upon	1
a	1
corner	1
house,	1
announced	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
our	1
red-headed	1
client	1
carried	1
on	1
his	1
business.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looked	1
it	1
all	1
over,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shining	1
brightly	1
between	1
puckered	1
lids.	1
Then	1
he	1
walked	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
then	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
corner,	1
still	1
looking	1
keenly	1
at	1
the	1
houses.	1
Finally	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
pawnbroker's,	1
and,	1
having	1
thumped	1
vigorously	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
with	1
his	1
stick	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
knocked.	1
It	1
was	1
instantly	1
opened	1
by	1
a	1
bright-looking,	1
clean-shaven	1
young	1
fellow,	1
who	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
step	1
in.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
only	1
wished	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
how	1
you	1
would	1
go	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
Strand."	1
	1
"Third	1
right,	1
fourth	1
left,"	1
answered	1
the	1
assistant	1
promptly,	1
closing	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Smart	1
fellow,	1
that,"	1
observed	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
walked	1
away.	1
"He	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
judgment,	1
the	1
fourth	1
smartest	1
man	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
for	1
daring	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
be	1
third.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
something	1
of	1
him	1
before."	1
	1
"Evidently,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"Mr.	1
Wilson's	1
assistant	1
counts	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
this	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
inquired	1
your	1
way	1
merely	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
see	1
him."	1
	1
"Not	1
him."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
knees	1
of	1
his	1
trousers."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
see?"	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
see."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
beat	1
the	1
pavement?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
doctor,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
observation,	1
not	1
for	1
talk.	1
We	1
are	1
spies	1
in	1
an	1
enemy's	1
country.	1
We	1
know	1
something	1
of	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
explore	1
the	1
parts	1
which	1
lie	1
behind	1
it."	1
	1
The	1
road	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
as	1
we	1
turned	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
from	1
the	1
retired	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square	1
presented	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
contrast	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
picture	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
arteries	1
which	1
conveyed	1
the	1
traffic	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
west.	1
The	1
roadway	1
was	1
blocked	1
with	1
the	1
immense	1
stream	1
of	1
commerce	1
flowing	1
in	1
a	1
double	1
tide	1
inward	1
and	1
outward,	1
while	1
the	1
footpaths	1
were	1
black	1
with	1
the	1
hurrying	1
swarm	1
of	1
pedestrians.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
realise	1
as	1
we	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
fine	1
shops	1
and	1
stately	1
business	1
premises	1
that	1
they	1
really	1
abutted	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
upon	1
the	1
faded	1
and	1
stagnant	1
square	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
quitted.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
see,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
and	1
glancing	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
just	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
here.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hobby	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
exact	1
knowledge	1
of	1
London.	1
There	1
is	1
Mortimer's,	1
the	1
tobacconist,	1
the	1
little	1
newspaper	1
shop,	1
the	1
Coburg	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
and	1
Suburban	1
Bank,	1
the	1
Vegetarian	1
Restaurant,	1
and	1
McFarlane's	1
carriage-building	1
depot.	1
That	1
carries	1
us	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
block.	1
And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
we've	1
done	1
our	1
work,	1
so	1
it's	1
time	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
play.	1
A	1
sandwich	1
and	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee,	1
and	1
then	1
off	1
to	1
violin-land,	1
where	1
all	1
is	1
sweetness	1
and	1
delicacy	1
and	1
harmony,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
red-headed	1
clients	1
to	1
vex	1
us	1
with	1
their	1
conundrums."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
was	1
an	1
enthusiastic	1
musician,	1
being	1
himself	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
capable	1
performer	1
but	1
a	1
composer	1
of	1
no	1
ordinary	1
merit.	1
All	1
the	1
afternoon	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
wrapped	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
happiness,	1
gently	1
waving	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
fingers	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
music,	1
while	1
his	1
gently	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
languid,	1
dreamy	1
eyes	1
were	1
as	1
unlike	1
those	1
of	1
Holmes	1
the	1
sleuth-hound,	1
Holmes	1
the	1
relentless,	1
keen-witted,	1
ready-handed	1
criminal	1
agent,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
conceive.	1
In	1
his	1
singular	1
character	1
the	1
dual	1
nature	1
alternately	1
asserted	1
itself,	1
and	1
his	1
extreme	1
exactness	1
and	1
astuteness	1
represented,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
thought,	1
the	1
reaction	1
against	1
the	1
poetic	1
and	1
contemplative	1
mood	1
which	1
occasionally	1
predominated	1
in	1
him.	1
The	1
swing	1
of	1
his	1
nature	1
took	1
him	1
from	1
extreme	1
languor	1
to	1
devouring	1
energy;	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
truly	1
formidable	1
as	1
when,	1
for	1
days	1
on	1
end,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
lounging	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
amid	1
his	1
improvisations	1
and	1
his	1
black-letter	1
editions.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
would	1
suddenly	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
brilliant	1
reasoning	1
power	1
would	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
intuition,	1
until	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
his	1
methods	1
would	1
look	1
askance	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
knowledge	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
other	1
mortals.	1
When	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon	1
so	1
enwrapped	1
in	1
the	1
music	1
at	1
St.	1
James's	1
Hall	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
an	1
evil	1
time	1
might	1
be	1
coming	1
upon	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
hunt	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
home,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
Doctor,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
as	1
we	1
emerged.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
business	1
to	1
do	1
which	1
will	1
take	1
some	1
hours.	1
This	1
business	1
at	1
Coburg	1
Square	1
is	1
serious."	1
	1
"Why	1
serious?"	1
	1
"A	1
considerable	1
crime	1
is	1
in	1
contemplation.	1
I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
stop	1
it.	1
But	1
to-day	1
being	1
Saturday	1
rather	1
complicates	1
matters.	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
your	1
help	1
to-night."	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
time?"	1
	1
"Ten	1
will	1
be	1
early	1
enough."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street	1
at	1
ten."	1
	1
"Very	1
well.	1
And,	1
I	1
say,	1
Doctor,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
little	1
danger,	1
so	1
kindly	1
put	1
your	1
army	1
revolver	1
in	1
your	1
pocket."	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hand,	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
heel,	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
among	1
the	1
crowd.	1
	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
more	1
dense	1
than	1
my	1
neighbours,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
oppressed	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
stupidity	1
in	1
my	1
dealings	1
with	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
Here	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard,	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
from	1
his	1
words	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen,	1
while	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
still	1
confused	1
and	1
grotesque.	1
As	1
I	1
drove	1
home	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
in	1
Kensington	1
I	1
thought	1
over	1
it	1
all,	1
from	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
red-headed	1
copier	1
of	1
the	1
"Encyclopaedia"	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square,	1
and	1
the	1
ominous	1
words	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
parted	1
from	1
me.	1
What	1
was	1
this	1
nocturnal	1
expedition,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
go	1
armed?	1
Where	1
were	1
we	1
going,	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
we	1
to	1
do?	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
hint	1
from	1
Holmes	1
that	1
this	1
smooth-faced	1
pawnbroker's	1
assistant	1
was	1
a	1
formidable	1
man--a	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
play	1
a	1
deep	1
game.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
puzzle	1
it	1
out,	1
but	1
gave	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
despair	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
matter	1
aside	1
until	1
night	1
should	1
bring	1
an	1
explanation.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quarter-past	1
nine	1
when	1
I	1
started	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
Park,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
Oxford	1
Street	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Two	1
hansoms	1
were	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
passage	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
from	1
above.	1
On	1
entering	1
his	1
room	1
I	1
found	1
Holmes	1
in	1
animated	1
conversation	1
with	1
two	1
men,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
recognised	1
as	1
Peter	1
Jones,	1
the	1
official	1
police	1
agent,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
a	1
long,	1
thin,	1
sad-faced	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
shiny	1
hat	1
and	1
oppressively	1
respectable	1
frock-coat.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
Our	1
party	1
is	1
complete,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
pea-jacket	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
heavy	1
hunting	1
crop	1
from	1
the	1
rack.	1
"Watson,	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Jones,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard?	1
Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
companion	1
in	1
to-night's	1
adventure."	1
	1
"We're	1
hunting	1
in	1
couples	1
again,	1
Doctor,	1
you	1
see,"	1
said	1
Jones	1
in	1
his	1
consequential	1
way.	1
"Our	1
friend	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
man	1
for	1
starting	1
a	1
chase.	1
All	1
he	1
wants	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
dog	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
running	1
down."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
a	1
wild	1
goose	1
may	1
not	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
our	1
chase,"	1
observed	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
gloomily.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
place	1
considerable	1
confidence	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
the	1
police	1
agent	1
loftily.	1
"He	1
has	1
his	1
own	1
little	1
methods,	1
which	1
are,	1
if	1
he	1
won't	1
mind	1
my	1
saying	1
so,	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
theoretical	1
and	1
fantastic,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
makings	1
of	1
a	1
detective	1
in	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
Sholto	1
murder	1
and	1
the	1
Agra	1
treasure,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
nearly	1
correct	1
than	1
the	1
official	1
force."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
say	1
so,	1
Mr.	1
Jones,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
stranger	1
with	1
deference.	1
"Still,	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
miss	1
my	1
rubber.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
Saturday	1
night	1
for	1
seven-and-twenty	1
years	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
had	1
my	1
rubber."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
find,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
you	1
will	1
play	1
for	1
a	1
higher	1
stake	1
to-night	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
yet,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
play	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
exciting.	1
For	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
the	1
stake	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
30,000	1
pounds;	1
and	1
for	1
you,	1
Jones,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
upon	1
whom	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
lay	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"John	1
Clay,	1
the	1
murderer,	1
thief,	1
smasher,	1
and	1
forger.	1
He's	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
profession,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
my	1
bracelets	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
on	1
any	1
criminal	1
in	1
London.	1
He's	1
a	1
remarkable	1
man,	1
is	1
young	1
John	1
Clay.	1
His	1
grandfather	1
was	1
a	1
royal	1
duke,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
Eton	1
and	1
Oxford.	1
His	1
brain	1
is	1
as	1
cunning	1
as	1
his	1
fingers,	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
meet	1
signs	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
turn,	1
we	1
never	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
man	1
himself.	1
He'll	1
crack	1
a	1
crib	1
in	1
Scotland	1
one	1
week,	1
and	1
be	1
raising	1
money	1
to	1
build	1
an	1
orphanage	1
in	1
Cornwall	1
the	1
next.	1
I've	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
track	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
have	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
him	1
yet."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
introducing	1
you	1
to-night.	1
I've	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
little	1
turns	1
also	1
with	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Clay,	1
and	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
profession.	1
It	1
is	1
past	1
ten,	1
however,	1
and	1
quite	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
started.	1
If	1
you	1
two	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
hansom,	1
Watson	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
in	1
the	1
second."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
communicative	1
during	1
the	1
long	1
drive	1
and	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
humming	1
the	1
tunes	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
We	1
rattled	1
through	1
an	1
endless	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
gas-lit	1
streets	1
until	1
we	1
emerged	1
into	1
Farrington	1
Street.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
close	1
there	1
now,"	1
my	1
friend	1
remarked.	1
"This	1
fellow	1
Merryweather	1
is	1
a	1
bank	1
director,	1
and	1
personally	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
Jones	1
with	1
us	1
also.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
fellow,	1
though	1
an	1
absolute	1
imbecile	1
in	1
his	1
profession.	1
He	1
has	1
one	1
positive	1
virtue.	1
He	1
is	1
as	1
brave	1
as	1
a	1
bulldog	1
and	1
as	1
tenacious	1
as	1
a	1
lobster	1
if	1
he	1
gets	1
his	1
claws	1
upon	1
anyone.	1
Here	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
us."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
same	1
crowded	1
thoroughfare	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
Our	1
cabs	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
and,	1
following	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
we	1
passed	1
down	1
a	1
narrow	1
passage	1
and	1
through	1
a	1
side	1
door,	1
which	1
he	1
opened	1
for	1
us.	1
Within	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
corridor,	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
massive	1
iron	1
gate.	1
This	1
also	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
led	1
down	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
winding	1
stone	1
steps,	1
which	1
terminated	1
at	1
another	1
formidable	1
gate.	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
stopped	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
lantern,	1
and	1
then	1
conducted	1
us	1
down	1
a	1
dark,	1
earth-smelling	1
passage,	1
and	1
so,	1
after	1
opening	1
a	1
third	1
door,	1
into	1
a	1
huge	1
vault	1
or	1
cellar,	1
which	1
was	1
piled	1
all	1
round	1
with	1
crates	1
and	1
massive	1
boxes.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
vulnerable	1
from	1
above,"	1
Holmes	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
lantern	1
and	1
gazed	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"Nor	1
from	1
below,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
striking	1
his	1
stick	1
upon	1
the	1
flags	1
which	1
lined	1
the	1
floor.	1
"Why,	1
dear	1
me,	1
it	1
sounds	1
quite	1
hollow!"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
looking	1
up	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
really	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
quiet!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
severely.	1
"You	1
have	1
already	1
imperilled	1
the	1
whole	1
success	1
of	1
our	1
expedition.	1
Might	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
upon	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
boxes,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
interfere?"	1
	1
The	1
solemn	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
perched	1
himself	1
upon	1
a	1
crate,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
injured	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
while	1
Holmes	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
lantern	1
and	1
a	1
magnifying	1
lens,	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
minutely	1
the	1
cracks	1
between	1
the	1
stones.	1
A	1
few	1
seconds	1
sufficed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
again	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
glass	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour	1
before	1
us,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"for	1
they	1
can	1
hardly	1
take	1
any	1
steps	1
until	1
the	1
good	1
pawnbroker	1
is	1
safely	1
in	1
bed.	1
Then	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
lose	1
a	1
minute,	1
for	1
the	1
sooner	1
they	1
do	1
their	1
work	1
the	1
longer	1
time	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
escape.	1
We	1
are	1
at	1
present,	1
Doctor--as	1
no	1
doubt	1
you	1
have	1
divined--in	1
the	1
cellar	1
of	1
the	1
City	1
branch	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
London	1
banks.	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
is	1
the	1
chairman	1
of	1
directors,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
reasons	1
why	1
the	1
more	1
daring	1
criminals	1
of	1
London	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
considerable	1
interest	1
in	1
this	1
cellar	1
at	1
present."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
our	1
French	1
gold,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
director.	1
"We	1
have	1
had	1
several	1
warnings	1
that	1
an	1
attempt	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
upon	1
it."	1
	1
"Your	1
French	1
gold?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
We	1
had	1
occasion	1
some	1
months	1
ago	1
to	1
strengthen	1
our	1
resources	1
and	1
borrowed	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
30,000	1
napoleons	1
from	1
the	1
Bank	1
of	1
France.	1
It	1
has	1
become	1
known	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
unpack	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
lying	1
in	1
our	1
cellar.	1
The	1
crate	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
sit	1
contains	1
2,000	1
napoleons	1
packed	1
between	1
layers	1
of	1
lead	1
foil.	1
Our	1
reserve	1
of	1
bullion	1
is	1
much	1
larger	1
at	1
present	1
than	1
is	1
usually	1
kept	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
branch	1
office,	1
and	1
the	1
directors	1
have	1
had	1
misgivings	1
upon	1
the	1
subject."	1
	1
"Which	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
justified,"	1
observed	1
Holmes.	1
"And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
arranged	1
our	1
little	1
plans.	1
I	1
expect	1
that	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
matters	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
head.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather,	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
the	1
screen	1
over	1
that	1
dark	1
lantern."	1
	1
"And	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
dark?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
so.	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards	1
in	1
my	1
pocket,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
a	1
partie	1
carrée,	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
your	1
rubber	1
after	1
all.	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
enemy's	1
preparations	1
have	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
we	1
cannot	1
risk	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
light.	1
And,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
we	1
must	1
choose	1
our	1
positions.	1
These	1
are	1
daring	1
men,	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
disadvantage,	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
us	1
some	1
harm	1
unless	1
we	1
are	1
careful.	1
I	1
shall	1
stand	1
behind	1
this	1
crate,	1
and	1
do	1
you	1
conceal	1
yourselves	1
behind	1
those.	1
Then,	1
when	1
I	1
flash	1
a	1
light	1
upon	1
them,	1
close	1
in	1
swiftly.	1
If	1
they	1
fire,	1
Watson,	1
have	1
no	1
compunction	1
about	1
shooting	1
them	1
down."	1
	1
I	1
placed	1
my	1
revolver,	1
cocked,	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wooden	1
case	1
behind	1
which	1
I	1
crouched.	1
Holmes	1
shot	1
the	1
slide	1
across	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
lantern	1
and	1
left	1
us	1
in	1
pitch	1
darkness--such	1
an	1
absolute	1
darkness	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
before	1
experienced.	1
The	1
smell	1
of	1
hot	1
metal	1
remained	1
to	1
assure	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
was	1
still	1
there,	1
ready	1
to	1
flash	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
moment's	1
notice.	1
To	1
me,	1
with	1
my	1
nerves	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
expectancy,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
depressing	1
and	1
subduing	1
in	1
the	1
sudden	1
gloom,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
dank	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
vault.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
retreat,"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
"That	1
is	1
back	1
through	1
the	1
house	1
into	1
Saxe-Coburg	1
Square.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
asked	1
you,	1
Jones?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
inspector	1
and	1
two	1
officers	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
have	1
stopped	1
all	1
the	1
holes.	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
silent	1
and	1
wait."	1
	1
What	1
a	1
time	1
it	1
seemed!	1
From	1
comparing	1
notes	1
afterwards	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
quarter,	1
yet	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
night	1
must	1
have	1
almost	1
gone	1
and	1
the	1
dawn	1
be	1
breaking	1
above	1
us.	1
My	1
limbs	1
were	1
weary	1
and	1
stiff,	1
for	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
position;	1
yet	1
my	1
nerves	1
were	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
of	1
tension,	1
and	1
my	1
hearing	1
was	1
so	1
acute	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
only	1
hear	1
the	1
gentle	1
breathing	1
of	1
my	1
companions,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
deeper,	1
heavier	1
in-breath	1
of	1
the	1
bulky	1
Jones	1
from	1
the	1
thin,	1
sighing	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
director.	1
From	1
my	1
position	1
I	1
could	1
look	1
over	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
floor.	1
Suddenly	1
my	1
eyes	1
caught	1
the	1
glint	1
of	1
a	1
light.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
lurid	1
spark	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
pavement.	1
Then	1
it	1
lengthened	1
out	1
until	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
yellow	1
line,	1
and	1
then,	1
without	1
any	1
warning	1
or	1
sound,	1
a	1
gash	1
seemed	1
to	1
open	1
and	1
a	1
hand	1
appeared,	1
a	1
white,	1
almost	1
womanly	1
hand,	1
which	1
felt	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
area	1
of	1
light.	1
For	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
more	1
the	1
hand,	1
with	1
its	1
writhing	1
fingers,	1
protruded	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
floor.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
withdrawn	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
it	1
appeared,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
again	1
save	1
the	1
single	1
lurid	1
spark	1
which	1
marked	1
a	1
chink	1
between	1
the	1
stones.	1
	1
Its	1
disappearance,	1
however,	1
was	1
but	1
momentary.	1
With	1
a	1
rending,	1
tearing	1
sound,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
broad,	1
white	1
stones	1
turned	1
over	1
upon	1
its	1
side	1
and	1
left	1
a	1
square,	1
gaping	1
hole,	1
through	1
which	1
streamed	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
lantern.	1
Over	1
the	1
edge	1
there	1
peeped	1
a	1
clean-cut,	1
boyish	1
face,	1
which	1
looked	1
keenly	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
aperture,	1
drew	1
itself	1
shoulder-high	1
and	1
waist-high,	1
until	1
one	1
knee	1
rested	1
upon	1
the	1
edge.	1
In	1
another	1
instant	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
was	1
hauling	1
after	1
him	1
a	1
companion,	1
lithe	1
and	1
small	1
like	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
shock	1
of	1
very	1
red	1
hair.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
clear,"	1
he	1
whispered.	1
"Have	1
you	1
the	1
chisel	1
and	1
the	1
bags?	1
Great	1
Scott!	1
Jump,	1
Archie,	1
jump,	1
and	1
I'll	1
swing	1
for	1
it!"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
sprung	1
out	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
intruder	1
by	1
the	1
collar.	1
The	1
other	1
dived	1
down	1
the	1
hole,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
rending	1
cloth	1
as	1
Jones	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
skirts.	1
The	1
light	1
flashed	1
upon	1
the	1
barrel	1
of	1
a	1
revolver,	1
but	1
Holmes'	1
hunting	1
crop	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
man's	1
wrist,	1
and	1
the	1
pistol	1
clinked	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
floor.	1
	1
"It's	1
no	1
use,	1
John	1
Clay,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
chance	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
see,"	1
the	1
other	1
answered	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
coolness.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
that	1
my	1
pal	1
is	1
all	1
right,	1
though	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
his	1
coat-tails."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
three	1
men	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!	1
You	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
thing	1
very	1
completely.	1
I	1
must	1
compliment	1
you."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
you,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"Your	1
red-headed	1
idea	1
was	1
very	1
new	1
and	1
effective."	1
	1
"You'll	1
see	1
your	1
pal	1
again	1
presently,"	1
said	1
Jones.	1
"He's	1
quicker	1
at	1
climbing	1
down	1
holes	1
than	1
I	1
am.	1
Just	1
hold	1
out	1
while	1
I	1
fix	1
the	1
derbies."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
touch	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
filthy	1
hands,"	1
remarked	1
our	1
prisoner	1
as	1
the	1
handcuffs	1
clattered	1
upon	1
his	1
wrists.	1
"You	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
royal	1
blood	1
in	1
my	1
veins.	1
Have	1
the	1
goodness,	1
also,	1
when	1
you	1
address	1
me	1
always	1
to	1
say	1
'sir'	1
and	1
'please.'"	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Jones	1
with	1
a	1
stare	1
and	1
a	1
snigger.	1
"Well,	1
would	1
you	1
please,	1
sir,	1
march	1
upstairs,	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
cab	1
to	1
carry	1
your	1
Highness	1
to	1
the	1
police-station?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
better,"	1
said	1
John	1
Clay	1
serenely.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
sweeping	1
bow	1
to	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
walked	1
quietly	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
the	1
detective.	1
	1
"Really,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Merryweather	1
as	1
we	1
followed	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
cellar,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
bank	1
can	1
thank	1
you	1
or	1
repay	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
detected	1
and	1
defeated	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
manner	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
determined	1
attempts	1
at	1
bank	1
robbery	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
come	1
within	1
my	1
experience."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
little	1
scores	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
to	1
settle	1
with	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Clay,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
some	1
small	1
expense	1
over	1
this	1
matter,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
the	1
bank	1
to	1
refund,	1
but	1
beyond	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
amply	1
repaid	1
by	1
having	1
had	1
an	1
experience	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
many	1
ways	1
unique,	1
and	1
by	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
remarkable	1
narrative	1
of	1
the	1
Red-headed	1
League."	1
	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
explained	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
over	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
whisky	1
and	1
soda	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
"it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
rather	1
fantastic	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
advertisement	1
of	1
the	1
League,	1
and	1
the	1
copying	1
of	1
the	1
'Encyclopaedia,'	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
get	1
this	1
not	1
over-bright	1
pawnbroker	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
hours	1
every	1
day.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
curious	1
way	1
of	1
managing	1
it,	1
but,	1
really,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
suggest	1
a	1
better.	1
The	1
method	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
suggested	1
to	1
Clay's	1
ingenious	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
accomplice's	1
hair.	1
The	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
week	1
was	1
a	1
lure	1
which	1
must	1
draw	1
him,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
who	1
were	1
playing	1
for	1
thousands?	1
They	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
advertisement,	1
one	1
rogue	1
has	1
the	1
temporary	1
office,	1
the	1
other	1
rogue	1
incites	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
apply	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
together	1
they	1
manage	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
absence	1
every	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
week.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
assistant	1
having	1
come	1
for	1
half	1
wages,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
strong	1
motive	1
for	1
securing	1
the	1
situation."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
guess	1
what	1
the	1
motive	1
was?"	1
	1
"Had	1
there	1
been	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
a	1
mere	1
vulgar	1
intrigue.	1
That,	1
however,	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
The	1
man's	1
business	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
which	1
could	1
account	1
for	1
such	1
elaborate	1
preparations,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
expenditure	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at.	1
It	1
must,	1
then,	1
be	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
assistant's	1
fondness	1
for	1
photography,	1
and	1
his	1
trick	1
of	1
vanishing	1
into	1
the	1
cellar.	1
The	1
cellar!	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
tangled	1
clue.	1
Then	1
I	1
made	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
mysterious	1
assistant	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
coolest	1
and	1
most	1
daring	1
criminals	1
in	1
London.	1
He	1
was	1
doing	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
cellar--something	1
which	1
took	1
many	1
hours	1
a	1
day	1
for	1
months	1
on	1
end.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be,	1
once	1
more?	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
a	1
tunnel	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
building.	1
	1
"So	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
got	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
I	1
surprised	1
you	1
by	1
beating	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
with	1
my	1
stick.	1
I	1
was	1
ascertaining	1
whether	1
the	1
cellar	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
or	1
behind.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
front.	1
Then	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
hoped,	1
the	1
assistant	1
answered	1
it.	1
We	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
skirmishes,	1
but	1
we	1
had	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
upon	1
each	1
other	1
before.	1
I	1
hardly	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
knees	1
were	1
what	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
see.	1
You	1
must	1
yourself	1
have	1
remarked	1
how	1
worn,	1
wrinkled,	1
and	1
stained	1
they	1
were.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
those	1
hours	1
of	1
burrowing.	1
The	1
only	1
remaining	1
point	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
burrowing	1
for.	1
I	1
walked	1
round	1
the	1
corner,	1
saw	1
the	1
City	1
and	1
Suburban	1
Bank	1
abutted	1
on	1
our	1
friend's	1
premises,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
solved	1
my	1
problem.	1
When	1
you	1
drove	1
home	1
after	1
the	1
concert	1
I	1
called	1
upon	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
chairman	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
directors,	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
seen."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
tell	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
make	1
their	1
attempt	1
to-night?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
they	1
closed	1
their	1
League	1
offices	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
they	1
cared	1
no	1
longer	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Jabez	1
Wilson's	1
presence--in	1
other	1
words,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
completed	1
their	1
tunnel.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
essential	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
use	1
it	1
soon,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
discovered,	1
or	1
the	1
bullion	1
might	1
be	1
removed.	1
Saturday	1
would	1
suit	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
day,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
their	1
escape.	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
reasons	1
I	1
expected	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to-night."	1
	1
"You	1
reasoned	1
it	1
out	1
beautifully,"	1
I	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
unfeigned	1
admiration.	1
"It	1
is	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
chain,	1
and	1
yet	1
every	1
link	1
rings	1
true."	1
	1
"It	1
saved	1
me	1
from	1
ennui,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
yawning.	1
"Alas!	1
I	1
already	1
feel	1
it	1
closing	1
in	1
upon	1
me.	1
My	1
life	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
one	1
long	1
effort	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
commonplaces	1
of	1
existence.	1
These	1
little	1
problems	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
benefactor	1
of	1
the	1
race,"	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Well,	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
use,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"'L'homme	1
c'est	1
rien--l'oeuvre	1
c'est	1
tout,'	1
as	1
Gustave	1
Flaubert	1
wrote	1
to	1
George	1
Sand."	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
III.	1
A	1
CASE	1
OF	1
IDENTITY	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
lodgings	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
"life	1
is	1
infinitely	1
stranger	1
than	1
anything	1
which	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man	1
could	1
invent.	1
We	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
conceive	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
really	1
mere	1
commonplaces	1
of	1
existence.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
fly	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
window	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
hover	1
over	1
this	1
great	1
city,	1
gently	1
remove	1
the	1
roofs,	1
and	1
peep	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
queer	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
going	1
on,	1
the	1
strange	1
coincidences,	1
the	1
plannings,	1
the	1
cross-purposes,	1
the	1
wonderful	1
chains	1
of	1
events,	1
working	1
through	1
generations,	1
and	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
outré	1
results,	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
all	1
fiction	1
with	1
its	1
conventionalities	1
and	1
foreseen	1
conclusions	1
most	1
stale	1
and	1
unprofitable."	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
convinced	1
of	1
it,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"The	1
cases	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
are,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
bald	1
enough,	1
and	1
vulgar	1
enough.	1
We	1
have	1
in	1
our	1
police	1
reports	1
realism	1
pushed	1
to	1
its	1
extreme	1
limits,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
result	1
is,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed,	1
neither	1
fascinating	1
nor	1
artistic."	1
	1
"A	1
certain	1
selection	1
and	1
discretion	1
must	1
be	1
used	1
in	1
producing	1
a	1
realistic	1
effect,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
wanting	1
in	1
the	1
police	1
report,	1
where	1
more	1
stress	1
is	1
laid,	1
perhaps,	1
upon	1
the	1
platitudes	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate	1
than	1
upon	1
the	1
details,	1
which	1
to	1
an	1
observer	1
contain	1
the	1
vital	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
unnatural	1
as	1
the	1
commonplace."	1
	1
I	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
my	1
head.	1
"I	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
your	1
thinking	1
so,"	1
I	1
said.	1
"Of	1
course,	1
in	1
your	1
position	1
of	1
unofficial	1
adviser	1
and	1
helper	1
to	1
everybody	1
who	1
is	1
absolutely	1
puzzled,	1
throughout	1
three	1
continents,	1
you	1
are	1
brought	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
strange	1
and	1
bizarre.	1
But	1
here"--I	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
morning	1
paper	1
from	1
the	1
ground--"let	1
us	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
practical	1
test.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
heading	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
come.	1
'A	1
husband's	1
cruelty	1
to	1
his	1
wife.'	1
There	1
is	1
half	1
a	1
column	1
of	1
print,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
without	1
reading	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
perfectly	1
familiar	1
to	1
me.	1
There	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
other	1
woman,	1
the	1
drink,	1
the	1
push,	1
the	1
blow,	1
the	1
bruise,	1
the	1
sympathetic	1
sister	1
or	1
landlady.	1
The	1
crudest	1
of	1
writers	1
could	1
invent	1
nothing	1
more	1
crude."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
your	1
example	1
is	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
one	1
for	1
your	1
argument,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
taking	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
glancing	1
his	1
eye	1
down	1
it.	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
Dundas	1
separation	1
case,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
happens,	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
clearing	1
up	1
some	1
small	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it.	1
The	1
husband	1
was	1
a	1
teetotaler,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
woman,	1
and	1
the	1
conduct	1
complained	1
of	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
drifted	1
into	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
winding	1
up	1
every	1
meal	1
by	1
taking	1
out	1
his	1
false	1
teeth	1
and	1
hurling	1
them	1
at	1
his	1
wife,	1
which,	1
you	1
will	1
allow,	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
action	1
likely	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
average	1
story-teller.	1
Take	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff,	1
Doctor,	1
and	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
scored	1
over	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
example."	1
	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
of	1
old	1
gold,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
amethyst	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lid.	1
Its	1
splendour	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
homely	1
ways	1
and	1
simple	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
commenting	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
forgot	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
you	1
for	1
some	1
weeks.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
souvenir	1
from	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
my	1
assistance	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
papers."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
ring?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
glancing	1
at	1
a	1
remarkable	1
brilliant	1
which	1
sparkled	1
upon	1
his	1
finger.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
reigning	1
family	1
of	1
Holland,	1
though	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
served	1
them	1
was	1
of	1
such	1
delicacy	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
confide	1
it	1
even	1
to	1
you,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
chronicle	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
little	1
problems."	1
	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
any	1
on	1
hand	1
just	1
now?"	1
I	1
asked	1
with	1
interest.	1
	1
"Some	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve,	1
but	1
none	1
which	1
present	1
any	1
feature	1
of	1
interest.	1
They	1
are	1
important,	1
you	1
understand,	1
without	1
being	1
interesting.	1
Indeed,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
usually	1
in	1
unimportant	1
matters	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
observation,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
quick	1
analysis	1
of	1
cause	1
and	1
effect	1
which	1
gives	1
the	1
charm	1
to	1
an	1
investigation.	1
The	1
larger	1
crimes	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
simpler,	1
for	1
the	1
bigger	1
the	1
crime	1
the	1
more	1
obvious,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
is	1
the	1
motive.	1
In	1
these	1
cases,	1
save	1
for	1
one	1
rather	1
intricate	1
matter	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
referred	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
Marseilles,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
which	1
presents	1
any	1
features	1
of	1
interest.	1
It	1
is	1
possible,	1
however,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
something	1
better	1
before	1
very	1
many	1
minutes	1
are	1
over,	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
clients,	1
or	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken."	1
	1
He	1
had	1
risen	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
was	1
standing	1
between	1
the	1
parted	1
blinds	1
gazing	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
dull	1
neutral-tinted	1
London	1
street.	1
Looking	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
opposite	1
there	1
stood	1
a	1
large	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
fur	1
boa	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
curling	1
red	1
feather	1
in	1
a	1
broad-brimmed	1
hat	1
which	1
was	1
tilted	1
in	1
a	1
coquettish	1
Duchess	1
of	1
Devonshire	1
fashion	1
over	1
her	1
ear.	1
From	1
under	1
this	1
great	1
panoply	1
she	1
peeped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
nervous,	1
hesitating	1
fashion	1
at	1
our	1
windows,	1
while	1
her	1
body	1
oscillated	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
and	1
her	1
fingers	1
fidgeted	1
with	1
her	1
glove	1
buttons.	1
Suddenly,	1
with	1
a	1
plunge,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
swimmer	1
who	1
leaves	1
the	1
bank,	1
she	1
hurried	1
across	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
sharp	1
clang	1
of	1
the	1
bell.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
those	1
symptoms	1
before,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
throwing	1
his	1
cigarette	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
"Oscillation	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
always	1
means	1
an	1
affaire	1
de	1
coeur.	1
She	1
would	1
like	1
advice,	1
but	1
is	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
delicate	1
for	1
communication.	1
And	1
yet	1
even	1
here	1
we	1
may	1
discriminate.	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
been	1
seriously	1
wronged	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
oscillates,	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
symptom	1
is	1
a	1
broken	1
bell	1
wire.	1
Here	1
we	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
love	1
matter,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
maiden	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
angry	1
as	1
perplexed,	1
or	1
grieved.	1
But	1
here	1
she	1
comes	1
in	1
person	1
to	1
resolve	1
our	1
doubts."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tap	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
in	1
buttons	1
entered	1
to	1
announce	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
while	1
the	1
lady	1
herself	1
loomed	1
behind	1
his	1
small	1
black	1
figure	1
like	1
a	1
full-sailed	1
merchant-man	1
behind	1
a	1
tiny	1
pilot	1
boat.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
welcomed	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
courtesy	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
remarkable,	1
and,	1
having	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
bowed	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
armchair,	1
he	1
looked	1
her	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
minute	1
and	1
yet	1
abstracted	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
find,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"that	1
with	1
your	1
short	1
sight	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
typewriting?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
at	1
first,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
"but	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
letters	1
are	1
without	1
looking."	1
Then,	1
suddenly	1
realising	1
the	1
full	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
looked	1
up,	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
astonishment	1
upon	1
her	1
broad,	1
good-humoured	1
face.	1
"You've	1
heard	1
about	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"else	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
that?"	1
	1
"Never	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing;	1
"it	1
is	1
my	1
business	1
to	1
know	1
things.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
have	1
trained	1
myself	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
others	1
overlook.	1
If	1
not,	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
consult	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
sir,	1
because	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Etherege,	1
whose	1
husband	1
you	1
found	1
so	1
easy	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
everyone	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
dead.	1
Oh,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
me.	1
I'm	1
not	1
rich,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
right,	1
besides	1
the	1
little	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
by	1
the	1
machine,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
away	1
to	1
consult	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
with	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
	1
Again	1
a	1
startled	1
look	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
somewhat	1
vacuous	1
face	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
did	1
bang	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"for	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
angry	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
easy	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Windibank--that	1
is,	1
my	1
father--took	1
it	1
all.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
at	1
last,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
nothing	1
and	1
kept	1
on	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harm	1
done,	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
mad,	1
and	1
I	1
just	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
things	1
and	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Your	1
father,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"your	1
stepfather,	1
surely,	1
since	1
the	1
name	1
is	1
different."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
stepfather.	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
father,	1
though	1
it	1
sounds	1
funny,	1
too,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
five	1
years	1
and	1
two	1
months	1
older	1
than	1
myself."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
mother	1
is	1
alive?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
mother	1
is	1
alive	1
and	1
well.	1
I	1
wasn't	1
best	1
pleased,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
she	1
married	1
again	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
father's	1
death,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
nearly	1
fifteen	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
herself.	1
Father	1
was	1
a	1
plumber	1
in	1
the	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road,	1
and	1
he	1
left	1
a	1
tidy	1
business	1
behind	1
him,	1
which	1
mother	1
carried	1
on	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hardy,	1
the	1
foreman;	1
but	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
came	1
he	1
made	1
her	1
sell	1
the	1
business,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
superior,	1
being	1
a	1
traveller	1
in	1
wines.	1
They	1
got	1
4700	1
pounds	1
for	1
the	1
goodwill	1
and	1
interest,	1
which	1
wasn't	1
near	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
father	1
could	1
have	1
got	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
alive."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
impatient	1
under	1
this	1
rambling	1
and	1
inconsequential	1
narrative,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
concentration	1
of	1
attention.	1
	1
"Your	1
own	1
little	1
income,"	1
he	1
asked,	1
"does	1
it	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
sir.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
separate	1
and	1
was	1
left	1
me	1
by	1
my	1
uncle	1
Ned	1
in	1
Auckland.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
New	1
Zealand	1
stock,	1
paying	1
4	1
1/2	1
per	1
cent.	1
Two	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
was	1
the	1
amount,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
interest."	1
	1
"You	1
interest	1
me	1
extremely,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"And	1
since	1
you	1
draw	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
sum	1
as	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
earn	1
into	1
the	1
bargain,	1
you	1
no	1
doubt	1
travel	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
indulge	1
yourself	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
lady	1
can	1
get	1
on	1
very	1
nicely	1
upon	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
about	1
60	1
pounds."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
do	1
with	1
much	1
less	1
than	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live	1
at	1
home	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
just	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
staying	1
with	1
them.	1
Of	1
course,	1
that	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
for	1
the	1
time.	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
draws	1
my	1
interest	1
every	1
quarter	1
and	1
pays	1
it	1
over	1
to	1
mother,	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
pretty	1
well	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
earn	1
at	1
typewriting.	1
It	1
brings	1
me	1
twopence	1
a	1
sheet,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
often	1
do	1
from	1
fifteen	1
to	1
twenty	1
sheets	1
in	1
a	1
day."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
position	1
very	1
clear	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
before	1
whom	1
you	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
before	1
myself.	1
Kindly	1
tell	1
us	1
now	1
all	1
about	1
your	1
connection	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
A	1
flush	1
stole	1
over	1
Miss	1
Sutherland's	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
picked	1
nervously	1
at	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
her	1
jacket.	1
"I	1
met	1
him	1
first	1
at	1
the	1
gasfitters'	1
ball,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"They	1
used	1
to	1
send	1
father	1
tickets	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alive,	1
and	1
then	1
afterwards	1
they	1
remembered	1
us,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
mother.	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
us	1
to	1
go.	1
He	1
never	1
did	1
wish	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere.	1
He	1
would	1
get	1
quite	1
mad	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
join	1
a	1
Sunday-school	1
treat.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
set	1
on	1
going,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
go;	1
for	1
what	1
right	1
had	1
he	1
to	1
prevent?	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
folk	1
were	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
know,	1
when	1
all	1
father's	1
friends	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
there.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
nothing	1
fit	1
to	1
wear,	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
purple	1
plush	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawer.	1
At	1
last,	1
when	1
nothing	1
else	1
would	1
do,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
France	1
upon	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
firm,	1
but	1
we	1
went,	1
mother	1
and	1
I,	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Hardy,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
foreman,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
I	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
came	1
back	1
from	1
France	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
annoyed	1
at	1
your	1
having	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
ball."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
about	1
it.	1
He	1
laughed,	1
I	1
remember,	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
denying	1
anything	1
to	1
a	1
woman,	1
for	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
her	1
way."	1
	1
"I	1
see.	1
Then	1
at	1
the	1
gasfitters'	1
ball	1
you	1
met,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
called	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
ask	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
got	1
home	1
all	1
safe,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
met	1
him--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
twice	1
for	1
walks,	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
father	1
came	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
any	1
more."	1
	1
"No?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
know	1
father	1
didn't	1
like	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
He	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
any	1
visitors	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
help	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
circle.	1
But	1
then,	1
as	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
mother,	1
a	1
woman	1
wants	1
her	1
own	1
circle	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
mine	1
yet."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?	1
Did	1
he	1
make	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
see	1
you?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
father	1
was	1
going	1
off	1
to	1
France	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
week,	1
and	1
Hosmer	1
wrote	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safer	1
and	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
gone.	1
We	1
could	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
and	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
write	1
every	1
day.	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
father	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
"Were	1
you	1
engaged	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
at	1
this	1
time?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
We	1
were	1
engaged	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
walk	1
that	1
we	1
took.	1
Hosmer--Mr.	1
Angel--was	1
a	1
cashier	1
in	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
Leadenhall	1
Street--and--"	1
	1
"What	1
office?"	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
he	1
live,	1
then?"	1
	1
"He	1
slept	1
on	1
the	1
premises."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
his	1
address?"	1
	1
"No--except	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Leadenhall	1
Street."	1
	1
"Where	1
did	1
you	1
address	1
your	1
letters,	1
then?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Leadenhall	1
Street	1
Post	1
Office,	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
till	1
called	1
for.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
office	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
chaffed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
clerks	1
about	1
having	1
letters	1
from	1
a	1
lady,	1
so	1
I	1
offered	1
to	1
typewrite	1
them,	1
like	1
he	1
did	1
his,	1
but	1
he	1
wouldn't	1
have	1
that,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
wrote	1
them	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
typewritten	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
machine	1
had	1
come	1
between	1
us.	1
That	1
will	1
just	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
fond	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
of."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
most	1
suggestive,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
an	1
axiom	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
are	1
infinitely	1
the	1
most	1
important.	1
Can	1
you	1
remember	1
any	1
other	1
little	1
things	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
"He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
shy	1
man,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
He	1
would	1
rather	1
walk	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
daylight,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
hated	1
to	1
be	1
conspicuous.	1
Very	1
retiring	1
and	1
gentlemanly	1
he	1
was.	1
Even	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
gentle.	1
He'd	1
had	1
the	1
quinsy	1
and	1
swollen	1
glands	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
young,	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
weak	1
throat,	1
and	1
a	1
hesitating,	1
whispering	1
fashion	1
of	1
speech.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
well	1
dressed,	1
very	1
neat	1
and	1
plain,	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
weak,	1
just	1
as	1
mine	1
are,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
tinted	1
glasses	1
against	1
the	1
glare."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
happened	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
your	1
stepfather,	1
returned	1
to	1
France?"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
again	1
and	1
proposed	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
marry	1
before	1
father	1
came	1
back.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
dreadful	1
earnest	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
swear,	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
Testament,	1
that	1
whatever	1
happened	1
I	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
him.	1
Mother	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
swear,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
passion.	1
Mother	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
was	1
even	1
fonder	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
I	1
was.	1
Then,	1
when	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
marrying	1
within	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
about	1
father;	1
but	1
they	1
both	1
said	1
never	1
to	1
mind	1
about	1
father,	1
but	1
just	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
mother	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
right	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
didn't	1
quite	1
like	1
that,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
seemed	1
funny	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
ask	1
his	1
leave,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
on	1
the	1
sly,	1
so	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
father	1
at	1
Bordeaux,	1
where	1
the	1
company	1
has	1
its	1
French	1
offices,	1
but	1
the	1
letter	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding."	1
	1
"It	1
missed	1
him,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
to	1
England	1
just	1
before	1
it	1
arrived."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
that	1
was	1
unfortunate.	1
Your	1
wedding	1
was	1
arranged,	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
Friday.	1
Was	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
church?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
but	1
very	1
quietly.	1
It	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
St.	1
Saviour's,	1
near	1
King's	1
Cross,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
breakfast	1
afterwards	1
at	1
the	1
St.	1
Pancras	1
Hotel.	1
Hosmer	1
came	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
hansom,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
us	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
both	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
stepped	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
four-wheeler,	1
which	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
other	1
cab	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
We	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
first,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
four-wheeler	1
drove	1
up	1
we	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
step	1
out,	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
did,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
cabman	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
looked	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
there!	1
The	1
cabman	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
get	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
That	1
was	1
last	1
Friday,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
anything	1
since	1
then	1
to	1
throw	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
shamefully	1
treated,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
sir!	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
good	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
so.	1
Why,	1
all	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
me	1
that,	1
whatever	1
happened,	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
true;	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
something	1
quite	1
unforeseen	1
occurred	1
to	1
separate	1
us,	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
pledged	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
claim	1
his	1
pledge	1
sooner	1
or	1
later.	1
It	1
seemed	1
strange	1
talk	1
for	1
a	1
wedding-morning,	1
but	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
since	1
gives	1
a	1
meaning	1
to	1
it."	1
	1
"Most	1
certainly	1
it	1
does.	1
Your	1
own	1
opinion	1
is,	1
then,	1
that	1
some	1
unforeseen	1
catastrophe	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
foresaw	1
some	1
danger,	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
talked	1
so.	1
And	1
then	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
foresaw	1
happened."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"One	1
more	1
question.	1
How	1
did	1
your	1
mother	1
take	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
again."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
father?	1
Did	1
you	1
tell	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
think,	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
Hosmer	1
again.	1
As	1
he	1
said,	1
what	1
interest	1
could	1
anyone	1
have	1
in	1
bringing	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
then	1
leaving	1
me?	1
Now,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
borrowed	1
my	1
money,	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
me	1
and	1
got	1
my	1
money	1
settled	1
on	1
him,	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
reason,	1
but	1
Hosmer	1
was	1
very	1
independent	1
about	1
money	1
and	1
never	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
shilling	1
of	1
mine.	1
And	1
yet,	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
happened?	1
And	1
why	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
write?	1
Oh,	1
it	1
drives	1
me	1
half-mad	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
sleep	1
a	1
wink	1
at	1
night."	1
She	1
pulled	1
a	1
little	1
handkerchief	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
muff	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
heavily	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
glance	1
into	1
the	1
case	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rising,	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
reach	1
some	1
definite	1
result.	1
Let	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
rest	1
upon	1
me	1
now,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
mind	1
dwell	1
upon	1
it	1
further.	1
Above	1
all,	1
try	1
to	1
let	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
vanish	1
from	1
your	1
memory,	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
from	1
your	1
life."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
don't	1
think	1
I'll	1
see	1
him	1
again?"	1
	1
"I	1
fear	1
not."	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
leave	1
that	1
question	1
in	1
my	1
hands.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
an	1
accurate	1
description	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
any	1
letters	1
of	1
his	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
spare."	1
	1
"I	1
advertised	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
last	1
Saturday's	1
Chronicle,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
slip	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
four	1
letters	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
And	1
your	1
address?"	1
	1
"No.	1
31	1
Lyon	1
Place,	1
Camberwell."	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Angel's	1
address	1
you	1
never	1
had,	1
I	1
understand.	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
father's	1
place	1
of	1
business?"	1
	1
"He	1
travels	1
for	1
Westhouse	1
&	1
Marbank,	1
the	1
great	1
claret	1
importers	1
of	1
Fenchurch	1
Street."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
statement	1
very	1
clearly.	1
You	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
papers	1
here,	1
and	1
remember	1
the	1
advice	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you.	1
Let	1
the	1
whole	1
incident	1
be	1
a	1
sealed	1
book,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
affect	1
your	1
life."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
that.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
Hosmer.	1
He	1
shall	1
find	1
me	1
ready	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
back."	1
	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
preposterous	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
vacuous	1
face,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
noble	1
in	1
the	1
simple	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
visitor	1
which	1
compelled	1
our	1
respect.	1
She	1
laid	1
her	1
little	1
bundle	1
of	1
papers	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
with	1
a	1
promise	1
to	1
come	1
again	1
whenever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
summoned.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
with	1
his	1
fingertips	1
still	1
pressed	1
together,	1
his	1
legs	1
stretched	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
gaze	1
directed	1
upward	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
rack	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
oily	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
counsellor,	1
and,	1
having	1
lit	1
it,	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
the	1
thick	1
blue	1
cloud-wreaths	1
spinning	1
up	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
infinite	1
languor	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Quite	1
an	1
interesting	1
study,	1
that	1
maiden,"	1
he	1
observed.	1
"I	1
found	1
her	1
more	1
interesting	1
than	1
her	1
little	1
problem,	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
trite	1
one.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
parallel	1
cases,	1
if	1
you	1
consult	1
my	1
index,	1
in	1
Andover	1
in	1
'77,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
at	1
The	1
Hague	1
last	1
year.	1
Old	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
idea,	1
however,	1
there	1
were	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
details	1
which	1
were	1
new	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
the	1
maiden	1
herself	1
was	1
most	1
instructive."	1
	1
"You	1
appeared	1
to	1
read	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
upon	1
her	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
invisible	1
to	1
me,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Not	1
invisible	1
but	1
unnoticed,	1
Watson.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
to	1
look,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
missed	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
important.	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
sleeves,	1
the	1
suggestiveness	1
of	1
thumb-nails,	1
or	1
the	1
great	1
issues	1
that	1
may	1
hang	1
from	1
a	1
boot-lace.	1
Now,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
that	1
woman's	1
appearance?	1
Describe	1
it."	1
	1
"Well,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
slate-coloured,	1
broad-brimmed	1
straw	1
hat,	1
with	1
a	1
feather	1
of	1
a	1
brickish	1
red.	1
Her	1
jacket	1
was	1
black,	1
with	1
black	1
beads	1
sewn	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
little	1
black	1
jet	1
ornaments.	1
Her	1
dress	1
was	1
brown,	1
rather	1
darker	1
than	1
coffee	1
colour,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
purple	1
plush	1
at	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
sleeves.	1
Her	1
gloves	1
were	1
greyish	1
and	1
were	1
worn	1
through	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
forefinger.	1
Her	1
boots	1
I	1
didn't	1
observe.	1
She	1
had	1
small	1
round,	1
hanging	1
gold	1
earrings,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
air	1
of	1
being	1
fairly	1
well-to-do	1
in	1
a	1
vulgar,	1
comfortable,	1
easy-going	1
way."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
softly	1
together	1
and	1
chuckled.	1
	1
"'Pon	1
my	1
word,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
are	1
coming	1
along	1
wonderfully.	1
You	1
have	1
really	1
done	1
very	1
well	1
indeed.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
missed	1
everything	1
of	1
importance,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
method,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
quick	1
eye	1
for	1
colour.	1
Never	1
trust	1
to	1
general	1
impressions,	1
my	1
boy,	1
but	1
concentrate	1
yourself	1
upon	1
details.	1
My	1
first	1
glance	1
is	1
always	1
at	1
a	1
woman's	1
sleeve.	1
In	1
a	1
man	1
it	1
is	1
perhaps	1
better	1
first	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
knee	1
of	1
the	1
trouser.	1
As	1
you	1
observe,	1
this	1
woman	1
had	1
plush	1
upon	1
her	1
sleeves,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
useful	1
material	1
for	1
showing	1
traces.	1
The	1
double	1
line	1
a	1
little	1
above	1
the	1
wrist,	1
where	1
the	1
typewritist	1
presses	1
against	1
the	1
table,	1
was	1
beautifully	1
defined.	1
The	1
sewing-machine,	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
type,	1
leaves	1
a	1
similar	1
mark,	1
but	1
only	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
farthest	1
from	1
the	1
thumb,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
broadest	1
part,	1
as	1
this	1
was.	1
I	1
then	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
face,	1
and,	1
observing	1
the	1
dint	1
of	1
a	1
pince-nez	1
at	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
nose,	1
I	1
ventured	1
a	1
remark	1
upon	1
short	1
sight	1
and	1
typewriting,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
surprise	1
her."	1
	1
"It	1
surprised	1
me."	1
	1
"But,	1
surely,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious.	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
much	1
surprised	1
and	1
interested	1
on	1
glancing	1
down	1
to	1
observe	1
that,	1
though	1
the	1
boots	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
wearing	1
were	1
not	1
unlike	1
each	1
other,	1
they	1
were	1
really	1
odd	1
ones;	1
the	1
one	1
having	1
a	1
slightly	1
decorated	1
toe-cap,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
plain	1
one.	1
One	1
was	1
buttoned	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
lower	1
buttons	1
out	1
of	1
five,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
first,	1
third,	1
and	1
fifth.	1
Now,	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
otherwise	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
has	1
come	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
with	1
odd	1
boots,	1
half-buttoned,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
deduction	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
hurry."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
else?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
keenly	1
interested,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
was,	1
by	1
my	1
friend's	1
incisive	1
reasoning.	1
	1
"I	1
noted,	1
in	1
passing,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
note	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
but	1
after	1
being	1
fully	1
dressed.	1
You	1
observed	1
that	1
her	1
right	1
glove	1
was	1
torn	1
at	1
the	1
forefinger,	1
but	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
apparently	1
see	1
that	1
both	1
glove	1
and	1
finger	1
were	1
stained	1
with	1
violet	1
ink.	1
She	1
had	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
and	1
dipped	1
her	1
pen	1
too	1
deep.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
this	1
morning,	1
or	1
the	1
mark	1
would	1
not	1
remain	1
clear	1
upon	1
the	1
finger.	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
amusing,	1
though	1
rather	1
elementary,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
business,	1
Watson.	1
Would	1
you	1
mind	1
reading	1
me	1
the	1
advertised	1
description	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
I	1
held	1
the	1
little	1
printed	1
slip	1
to	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
"Missing,"	1
it	1
said,	1
"on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
fourteenth,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
named	1
Hosmer	1
Angel.	1
About	1
five	1
ft.	1
seven	1
in.	1
in	1
height;	1
strongly	1
built,	1
sallow	1
complexion,	1
black	1
hair,	1
a	1
little	1
bald	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
bushy,	1
black	1
side-whiskers	1
and	1
moustache;	1
tinted	1
glasses,	1
slight	1
infirmity	1
of	1
speech.	1
Was	1
dressed,	1
when	1
last	1
seen,	1
in	1
black	1
frock-coat	1
faced	1
with	1
silk,	1
black	1
waistcoat,	1
gold	1
Albert	1
chain,	1
and	1
grey	1
Harris	1
tweed	1
trousers,	1
with	1
brown	1
gaiters	1
over	1
elastic-sided	1
boots.	1
Known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
in	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
Leadenhall	1
Street.	1
Anybody	1
bringing--"	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"As	1
to	1
the	1
letters,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
glancing	1
over	1
them,	1
"they	1
are	1
very	1
commonplace.	1
Absolutely	1
no	1
clue	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Angel,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
quotes	1
Balzac	1
once.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
remarkable	1
point,	1
however,	1
which	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
strike	1
you."	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
typewritten,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Not	1
only	1
that,	1
but	1
the	1
signature	1
is	1
typewritten.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
neat	1
little	1
'Hosmer	1
Angel'	1
at	1
the	1
bottom.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
date,	1
you	1
see,	1
but	1
no	1
superscription	1
except	1
Leadenhall	1
Street,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
vague.	1
The	1
point	1
about	1
the	1
signature	1
is	1
very	1
suggestive--in	1
fact,	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
it	1
conclusive."	1
	1
"Of	1
what?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
strongly	1
it	1
bears	1
upon	1
the	1
case?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deny	1
his	1
signature	1
if	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
breach	1
of	1
promise	1
were	1
instituted."	1
	1
"No,	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
However,	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
two	1
letters,	1
which	1
should	1
settle	1
the	1
matter.	1
One	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
firm	1
in	1
the	1
City,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
stepfather,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
meet	1
us	1
here	1
at	1
six	1
o'clock	1
tomorrow	1
evening.	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
male	1
relatives.	1
And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
the	1
answers	1
to	1
those	1
letters	1
come,	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
put	1
our	1
little	1
problem	1
upon	1
the	1
shelf	1
for	1
the	1
interim."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
reasons	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
friend's	1
subtle	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
energy	1
in	1
action	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
solid	1
grounds	1
for	1
the	1
assured	1
and	1
easy	1
demeanour	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
the	1
singular	1
mystery	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
fathom.	1
Once	1
only	1
had	1
I	1
known	1
him	1
to	1
fail,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
photograph;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
weird	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
Sign	1
of	1
Four,	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
strange	1
tangle	1
indeed	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
unravel.	1
	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
then,	1
still	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
black	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
with	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
evening	1
I	1
would	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
all	1
the	1
clues	1
which	1
would	1
lead	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
disappearing	1
bridegroom	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland.	1
	1
A	1
professional	1
case	1
of	1
great	1
gravity	1
was	1
engaging	1
my	1
own	1
attention	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
next	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
busy	1
at	1
the	1
bedside	1
of	1
the	1
sufferer.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
close	1
upon	1
six	1
o'clock	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
free	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
spring	1
into	1
a	1
hansom	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
half	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
assist	1
at	1
the	1
dénouement	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
mystery.	1
I	1
found	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
alone,	1
however,	1
half	1
asleep,	1
with	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
form	1
curled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
his	1
armchair.	1
A	1
formidable	1
array	1
of	1
bottles	1
and	1
test-tubes,	1
with	1
the	1
pungent	1
cleanly	1
smell	1
of	1
hydrochloric	1
acid,	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
his	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
chemical	1
work	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
solved	1
it?"	1
I	1
asked	1
as	1
I	1
entered.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
bisulphate	1
of	1
baryta."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
the	1
mystery!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that!	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
salt	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
working	1
upon.	1
There	1
was	1
never	1
any	1
mystery	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
though,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
details	1
are	1
of	1
interest.	1
The	1
only	1
drawback	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law,	1
I	1
fear,	1
that	1
can	1
touch	1
the	1
scoundrel."	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
he,	1
then,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
object	1
in	1
deserting	1
Miss	1
Sutherland?"	1
	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
hardly	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
opened	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
a	1
heavy	1
footfall	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
a	1
tap	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
girl's	1
stepfather,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"He	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
here	1
at	1
six.	1
Come	1
in!"	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
a	1
sturdy,	1
middle-sized	1
fellow,	1
some	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
clean-shaven,	1
and	1
sallow-skinned,	1
with	1
a	1
bland,	1
insinuating	1
manner,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
wonderfully	1
sharp	1
and	1
penetrating	1
grey	1
eyes.	1
He	1
shot	1
a	1
questioning	1
glance	1
at	1
each	1
of	1
us,	1
placed	1
his	1
shiny	1
top-hat	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow	1
sidled	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
nearest	1
chair.	1
	1
"Good-evening,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
typewritten	1
letter	1
is	1
from	1
you,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
made	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
six	1
o'clock?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
little	1
late,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
my	1
own	1
master,	1
you	1
know.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
that	1
Miss	1
Sutherland	1
has	1
troubled	1
you	1
about	1
this	1
little	1
matter,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
wash	1
linen	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
in	1
public.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
against	1
my	1
wishes	1
that	1
she	1
came,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
excitable,	1
impulsive	1
girl,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
noticed,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
controlled	1
when	1
she	1
has	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
on	1
a	1
point.	1
Of	1
course,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mind	1
you	1
so	1
much,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
police,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
pleasant	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
family	1
misfortune	1
like	1
this	1
noised	1
abroad.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
useless	1
expense,	1
for	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
possibly	1
find	1
this	1
Hosmer	1
Angel?"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly;	1
"I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
succeed	1
in	1
discovering	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
gloves.	1
"I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
it,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
curious	1
thing,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
a	1
typewriter	1
has	1
really	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
individuality	1
as	1
a	1
man's	1
handwriting.	1
Unless	1
they	1
are	1
quite	1
new,	1
no	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
write	1
exactly	1
alike.	1
Some	1
letters	1
get	1
more	1
worn	1
than	1
others,	1
and	1
some	1
wear	1
only	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
Now,	1
you	1
remark	1
in	1
this	1
note	1
of	1
yours,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
little	1
slurring	1
over	1
of	1
the	1
'e,'	1
and	1
a	1
slight	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
'r.'	1
There	1
are	1
fourteen	1
other	1
characteristics,	1
but	1
those	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
obvious."	1
	1
"We	1
do	1
all	1
our	1
correspondence	1
with	1
this	1
machine	1
at	1
the	1
office,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
worn,"	1
our	1
visitor	1
answered,	1
glancing	1
keenly	1
at	1
Holmes	1
with	1
his	1
bright	1
little	1
eyes.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
study,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,"	1
Holmes	1
continued.	1
"I	1
think	1
of	1
writing	1
another	1
little	1
monograph	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
typewriter	1
and	1
its	1
relation	1
to	1
crime.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
devoted	1
some	1
little	1
attention.	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
four	1
letters	1
which	1
purport	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
missing	1
man.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
typewritten.	1
In	1
each	1
case,	1
not	1
only	1
are	1
the	1
'e's'	1
slurred	1
and	1
the	1
'r's'	1
tailless,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
observe,	1
if	1
you	1
care	1
to	1
use	1
my	1
magnifying	1
lens,	1
that	1
the	1
fourteen	1
other	1
characteristics	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
alluded	1
are	1
there	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
Mr.	1
Windibank	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
hat.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
waste	1
time	1
over	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
fantastic	1
talk,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
catch	1
the	1
man,	1
catch	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
it."	1
	1
"Certainly,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
stepping	1
over	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
"I	1
let	1
you	1
know,	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
him!"	1
	1
"What!	1
where?"	1
shouted	1
Mr.	1
Windibank,	1
turning	1
white	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
glancing	1
about	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
rat	1
in	1
a	1
trap.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
won't	1
do--really	1
it	1
won't,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
suavely.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
possible	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
too	1
transparent,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
compliment	1
when	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
solve	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
question.	1
That's	1
right!	1
Sit	1
down	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
it	1
over."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
collapsed	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
with	1
a	1
ghastly	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
glitter	1
of	1
moisture	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
"It--it's	1
not	1
actionable,"	1
he	1
stammered.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not.	1
But	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
Windibank,	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
cruel	1
and	1
selfish	1
and	1
heartless	1
a	1
trick	1
in	1
a	1
petty	1
way	1
as	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me.	1
Now,	1
let	1
me	1
just	1
run	1
over	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
contradict	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
wrong."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sat	1
huddled	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
utterly	1
crushed.	1
Holmes	1
stuck	1
his	1
feet	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
and,	1
leaning	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
began	1
talking,	1
rather	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
than	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"The	1
man	1
married	1
a	1
woman	1
very	1
much	1
older	1
than	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
money,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"and	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
lived	1
with	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum,	1
for	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
position,	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
serious	1
difference.	1
It	1
was	1
worth	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
preserve	1
it.	1
The	1
daughter	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
good,	1
amiable	1
disposition,	1
but	1
affectionate	1
and	1
warm-hearted	1
in	1
her	1
ways,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
with	1
her	1
fair	1
personal	1
advantages,	1
and	1
her	1
little	1
income,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
remain	1
single	1
long.	1
Now	1
her	1
marriage	1
would	1
mean,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year,	1
so	1
what	1
does	1
her	1
stepfather	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
it?	1
He	1
takes	1
the	1
obvious	1
course	1
of	1
keeping	1
her	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
forbidding	1
her	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
people	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
age.	1
But	1
soon	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
answer	1
forever.	1
She	1
became	1
restive,	1
insisted	1
upon	1
her	1
rights,	1
and	1
finally	1
announced	1
her	1
positive	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
ball.	1
What	1
does	1
her	1
clever	1
stepfather	1
do	1
then?	1
He	1
conceives	1
an	1
idea	1
more	1
creditable	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
With	1
the	1
connivance	1
and	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
disguised	1
himself,	1
covered	1
those	1
keen	1
eyes	1
with	1
tinted	1
glasses,	1
masked	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
moustache	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
bushy	1
whiskers,	1
sunk	1
that	1
clear	1
voice	1
into	1
an	1
insinuating	1
whisper,	1
and	1
doubly	1
secure	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
girl's	1
short	1
sight,	1
he	1
appears	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel,	1
and	1
keeps	1
off	1
other	1
lovers	1
by	1
making	1
love	1
himself."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
joke	1
at	1
first,"	1
groaned	1
our	1
visitor.	1
"We	1
never	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
carried	1
away."	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
not.	1
However	1
that	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
was	1
very	1
decidedly	1
carried	1
away,	1
and,	1
having	1
quite	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
that	1
her	1
stepfather	1
was	1
in	1
France,	1
the	1
suspicion	1
of	1
treachery	1
never	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
entered	1
her	1
mind.	1
She	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
attentions,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
loudly	1
expressed	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
mother.	1
Then	1
Mr.	1
Angel	1
began	1
to	1
call,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
should	1
be	1
pushed	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
go	1
if	1
a	1
real	1
effect	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
produced.	1
There	1
were	1
meetings,	1
and	1
an	1
engagement,	1
which	1
would	1
finally	1
secure	1
the	1
girl's	1
affections	1
from	1
turning	1
towards	1
anyone	1
else.	1
But	1
the	1
deception	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
up	1
forever.	1
These	1
pretended	1
journeys	1
to	1
France	1
were	1
rather	1
cumbrous.	1
The	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
clearly	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
business	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dramatic	1
manner	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
leave	1
a	1
permanent	1
impression	1
upon	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
mind	1
and	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
looking	1
upon	1
any	1
other	1
suitor	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
come.	1
Hence	1
those	1
vows	1
of	1
fidelity	1
exacted	1
upon	1
a	1
Testament,	1
and	1
hence	1
also	1
the	1
allusions	1
to	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
something	1
happening	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding.	1
James	1
Windibank	1
wished	1
Miss	1
Sutherland	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
bound	1
to	1
Hosmer	1
Angel,	1
and	1
so	1
uncertain	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
fate,	1
that	1
for	1
ten	1
years	1
to	1
come,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
church	1
door	1
he	1
brought	1
her,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
no	1
farther,	1
he	1
conveniently	1
vanished	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
trick	1
of	1
stepping	1
in	1
at	1
one	1
door	1
of	1
a	1
four-wheeler	1
and	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
events,	1
Mr.	1
Windibank!"	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
had	1
recovered	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
assurance	1
while	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
talking,	1
and	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
now	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
sneer	1
upon	1
his	1
pale	1
face.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
so,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
not,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
very	1
sharp	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
sharp	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
now,	1
and	1
not	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
actionable	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
but	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
keep	1
that	1
door	1
locked	1
you	1
lay	1
yourself	1
open	1
to	1
an	1
action	1
for	1
assault	1
and	1
illegal	1
constraint."	1
	1
"The	1
law	1
cannot,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
touch	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
unlocking	1
and	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
"yet	1
there	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
deserved	1
punishment	1
more.	1
If	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
has	1
a	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
friend,	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
whip	1
across	1
your	1
shoulders.	1
By	1
Jove!"	1
he	1
continued,	1
flushing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
bitter	1
sneer	1
upon	1
the	1
man's	1
face,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
duties	1
to	1
my	1
client,	1
but	1
here's	1
a	1
hunting	1
crop	1
handy,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
just	1
treat	1
myself	1
to--"	1
He	1
took	1
two	1
swift	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
whip,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
grasp	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
clatter	1
of	1
steps	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
heavy	1
hall	1
door	1
banged,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
Mr.	1
James	1
Windibank	1
running	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
speed	1
down	1
the	1
road.	1
	1
"There's	1
a	1
cold-blooded	1
scoundrel!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing,	1
as	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
into	1
his	1
chair	1
once	1
more.	1
"That	1
fellow	1
will	1
rise	1
from	1
crime	1
to	1
crime	1
until	1
he	1
does	1
something	1
very	1
bad,	1
and	1
ends	1
on	1
a	1
gallows.	1
The	1
case	1
has,	1
in	1
some	1
respects,	1
been	1
not	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
now	1
entirely	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
your	1
reasoning,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Hosmer	1
Angel	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
strong	1
object	1
for	1
his	1
curious	1
conduct,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
really	1
profited	1
by	1
the	1
incident,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
see,	1
was	1
the	1
stepfather.	1
Then	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
were	1
never	1
together,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
always	1
appeared	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
away,	1
was	1
suggestive.	1
So	1
were	1
the	1
tinted	1
spectacles	1
and	1
the	1
curious	1
voice,	1
which	1
both	1
hinted	1
at	1
a	1
disguise,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
bushy	1
whiskers.	1
My	1
suspicions	1
were	1
all	1
confirmed	1
by	1
his	1
peculiar	1
action	1
in	1
typewriting	1
his	1
signature,	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
inferred	1
that	1
his	1
handwriting	1
was	1
so	1
familiar	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
recognise	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
sample	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
isolated	1
facts,	1
together	1
with	1
many	1
minor	1
ones,	1
all	1
pointed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
verify	1
them?"	1
	1
"Having	1
once	1
spotted	1
my	1
man,	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
get	1
corroboration.	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
firm	1
for	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
worked.	1
Having	1
taken	1
the	1
printed	1
description.	1
I	1
eliminated	1
everything	1
from	1
it	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
disguise--the	1
whiskers,	1
the	1
glasses,	1
the	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
firm,	1
with	1
a	1
request	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
inform	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
answered	1
to	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
travellers.	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
noticed	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1
typewriter,	1
and	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
himself	1
at	1
his	1
business	1
address	1
asking	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
here.	1
As	1
I	1
expected,	1
his	1
reply	1
was	1
typewritten	1
and	1
revealed	1
the	1
same	1
trivial	1
but	1
characteristic	1
defects.	1
The	1
same	1
post	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Westhouse	1
&	1
Marbank,	1
of	1
Fenchurch	1
Street,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
description	1
tallied	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
employé,	1
James	1
Windibank.	1
Voilà	1
tout!"	1
	1
"And	1
Miss	1
Sutherland?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
me.	1
You	1
may	1
remember	1
the	1
old	1
Persian	1
saying,	1
'There	1
is	1
danger	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
taketh	1
the	1
tiger	1
cub,	1
and	1
danger	1
also	1
for	1
whoso	1
snatches	1
a	1
delusion	1
from	1
a	1
woman.'	1
There	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
sense	1
in	1
Hafiz	1
as	1
in	1
Horace,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
IV.	1
THE	1
BOSCOMBE	1
VALLEY	1
MYSTERY	1
	1
We	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
breakfast	1
one	1
morning,	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
I,	1
when	1
the	1
maid	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
telegram.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
to	1
spare?	1
Have	1
just	1
been	1
wired	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
of	1
England	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
Boscombe	1
Valley	1
tragedy.	1
Shall	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
me.	1
Air	1
and	1
scenery	1
perfect.	1
Leave	1
Paddington	1
by	1
the	1
11:15."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
say,	1
dear?"	1
said	1
my	1
wife,	1
looking	1
across	1
at	1
me.	1
"Will	1
you	1
go?"	1
	1
"I	1
really	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
fairly	1
long	1
list	1
at	1
present."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Anstruther	1
would	1
do	1
your	1
work	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
a	1
little	1
pale	1
lately.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
change	1
would	1
do	1
you	1
good,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
so	1
interested	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
cases."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
ungrateful	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not,	1
seeing	1
what	1
I	1
gained	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
them,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
go,	1
I	1
must	1
pack	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
half	1
an	1
hour."	1
	1
My	1
experience	1
of	1
camp	1
life	1
in	1
Afghanistan	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
making	1
me	1
a	1
prompt	1
and	1
ready	1
traveller.	1
My	1
wants	1
were	1
few	1
and	1
simple,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
time	1
stated	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
with	1
my	1
valise,	1
rattling	1
away	1
to	1
Paddington	1
Station.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
platform,	1
his	1
tall,	1
gaunt	1
figure	1
made	1
even	1
gaunter	1
and	1
taller	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
grey	1
travelling-cloak	1
and	1
close-fitting	1
cloth	1
cap.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
makes	1
a	1
considerable	1
difference	1
to	1
me,	1
having	1
someone	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
thoroughly	1
rely.	1
Local	1
aid	1
is	1
always	1
either	1
worthless	1
or	1
else	1
biassed.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
two	1
corner	1
seats	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
the	1
tickets."	1
	1
We	1
had	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
ourselves	1
save	1
for	1
an	1
immense	1
litter	1
of	1
papers	1
which	1
Holmes	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him.	1
Among	1
these	1
he	1
rummaged	1
and	1
read,	1
with	1
intervals	1
of	1
note-taking	1
and	1
of	1
meditation,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
past	1
Reading.	1
Then	1
he	1
suddenly	1
rolled	1
them	1
all	1
into	1
a	1
gigantic	1
ball	1
and	1
tossed	1
them	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
rack.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
heard	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
case?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
word.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
paper	1
for	1
some	1
days."	1
	1
"The	1
London	1
press	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
very	1
full	1
accounts.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
looking	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
papers	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
particulars.	1
It	1
seems,	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
gather,	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
simple	1
cases	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
extremely	1
difficult."	1
	1
"That	1
sounds	1
a	1
little	1
paradoxical."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
profoundly	1
true.	1
Singularity	1
is	1
almost	1
invariably	1
a	1
clue.	1
The	1
more	1
featureless	1
and	1
commonplace	1
a	1
crime	1
is,	1
the	1
more	1
difficult	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
home.	1
In	1
this	1
case,	1
however,	1
they	1
have	1
established	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
case	1
against	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
murdered	1
man."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
murder,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
conjectured	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
granted	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
looking	1
personally	1
into	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
explain	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
you,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
understand	1
it,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
"Boscombe	1
Valley	1
is	1
a	1
country	1
district	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
Ross,	1
in	1
Herefordshire.	1
The	1
largest	1
landed	1
proprietor	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
is	1
a	1
Mr.	1
John	1
Turner,	1
who	1
made	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
Australia	1
and	1
returned	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
country.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
farms	1
which	1
he	1
held,	1
that	1
of	1
Hatherley,	1
was	1
let	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Charles	1
McCarthy,	1
who	1
was	1
also	1
an	1
ex-Australian.	1
The	1
men	1
had	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
colonies,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unnatural	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
so	1
as	1
near	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
possible.	1
Turner	1
was	1
apparently	1
the	1
richer	1
man,	1
so	1
McCarthy	1
became	1
his	1
tenant	1
but	1
still	1
remained,	1
it	1
seems,	1
upon	1
terms	1
of	1
perfect	1
equality,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
frequently	1
together.	1
McCarthy	1
had	1
one	1
son,	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
Turner	1
had	1
an	1
only	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age,	1
but	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
wives	1
living.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
avoided	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
English	1
families	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
led	1
retired	1
lives,	1
though	1
both	1
the	1
McCarthys	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
sport	1
and	1
were	1
frequently	1
seen	1
at	1
the	1
race-meetings	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
McCarthy	1
kept	1
two	1
servants--a	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
girl.	1
Turner	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
household,	1
some	1
half-dozen	1
at	1
the	1
least.	1
That	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
gather	1
about	1
the	1
families.	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
facts.	1
	1
"On	1
June	1
3rd,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Monday	1
last,	1
McCarthy	1
left	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
Hatherley	1
about	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
walked	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
lake	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
spreading	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Valley.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
serving-man	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
at	1
Ross,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
hurry,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
appointment	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
keep	1
at	1
three.	1
From	1
that	1
appointment	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
back	1
alive.	1
	1
"From	1
Hatherley	1
Farm-house	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
is	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile,	1
and	1
two	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
over	1
this	1
ground.	1
One	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
a	1
game-keeper	1
in	1
the	1
employ	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Turner.	1
Both	1
these	1
witnesses	1
depose	1
that	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
walking	1
alone.	1
The	1
game-keeper	1
adds	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
his	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
pass	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
son,	1
Mr.	1
James	1
McCarthy,	1
going	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
with	1
a	1
gun	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
To	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
belief,	1
the	1
father	1
was	1
actually	1
in	1
sight	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
was	1
following	1
him.	1
He	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
until	1
he	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
that	1
had	1
occurred.	1
	1
"The	1
two	1
McCarthys	1
were	1
seen	1
after	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
the	1
game-keeper,	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
is	1
thickly	1
wooded	1
round,	1
with	1
just	1
a	1
fringe	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
of	1
reeds	1
round	1
the	1
edge.	1
A	1
girl	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
Patience	1
Moran,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
of	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Valley	1
estate,	1
was	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
picking	1
flowers.	1
She	1
states	1
that	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
she	1
saw,	1
at	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
lake,	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
violent	1
quarrel.	1
She	1
heard	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
the	1
elder	1
using	1
very	1
strong	1
language	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
and	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
latter	1
raise	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
strike	1
his	1
father.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
by	1
their	1
violence	1
that	1
she	1
ran	1
away	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
mother	1
when	1
she	1
reached	1
home	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
two	1
McCarthys	1
quarrelling	1
near	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
fight.	1
She	1
had	1
hardly	1
said	1
the	1
words	1
when	1
young	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lodge	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
his	1
father	1
dead	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
lodge-keeper.	1
He	1
was	1
much	1
excited,	1
without	1
either	1
his	1
gun	1
or	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
sleeve	1
were	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
stained	1
with	1
fresh	1
blood.	1
On	1
following	1
him	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
stretched	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
grass	1
beside	1
the	1
pool.	1
The	1
head	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
in	1
by	1
repeated	1
blows	1
of	1
some	1
heavy	1
and	1
blunt	1
weapon.	1
The	1
injuries	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
inflicted	1
by	1
the	1
butt-end	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
gun,	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
Under	1
these	1
circumstances	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
instantly	1
arrested,	1
and	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'wilful	1
murder'	1
having	1
been	1
returned	1
at	1
the	1
inquest	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
brought	1
before	1
the	1
magistrates	1
at	1
Ross,	1
who	1
have	1
referred	1
the	1
case	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
Assizes.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
main	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
coroner	1
and	1
the	1
police-court."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
hardly	1
imagine	1
a	1
more	1
damning	1
case,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"If	1
ever	1
circumstantial	1
evidence	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
criminal	1
it	1
does	1
so	1
here."	1
	1
"Circumstantial	1
evidence	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
tricky	1
thing,"	1
answered	1
Holmes	1
thoughtfully.	1
"It	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
point	1
very	1
straight	1
to	1
one	1
thing,	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
shift	1
your	1
own	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
a	1
little,	1
you	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
pointing	1
in	1
an	1
equally	1
uncompromising	1
manner	1
to	1
something	1
entirely	1
different.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
looks	1
exceedingly	1
grave	1
against	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
culprit.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
however,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
Miss	1
Turner,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
landowner,	1
who	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
innocence,	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
retained	1
Lestrade,	1
whom	1
you	1
may	1
recollect	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
Study	1
in	1
Scarlet,	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
his	1
interest.	1
Lestrade,	1
being	1
rather	1
puzzled,	1
has	1
referred	1
the	1
case	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
hence	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
two	1
middle-aged	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
flying	1
westward	1
at	1
fifty	1
miles	1
an	1
hour	1
instead	1
of	1
quietly	1
digesting	1
their	1
breakfasts	1
at	1
home."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"that	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
so	1
obvious	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
little	1
credit	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
case."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
deceptive	1
than	1
an	1
obvious	1
fact,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
laughing.	1
"Besides,	1
we	1
may	1
chance	1
to	1
hit	1
upon	1
some	1
other	1
obvious	1
facts	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
obvious	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade.	1
You	1
know	1
me	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
boasting	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
either	1
confirm	1
or	1
destroy	1
his	1
theory	1
by	1
means	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
incapable	1
of	1
employing,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
understanding.	1
To	1
take	1
the	1
first	1
example	1
to	1
hand,	1
I	1
very	1
clearly	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
your	1
bedroom	1
the	1
window	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
question	1
whether	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade	1
would	1
have	1
noted	1
even	1
so	1
self-evident	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
that."	1
	1
"How	1
on	1
earth--"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
well.	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
military	1
neatness	1
which	1
characterises	1
you.	1
You	1
shave	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
season	1
you	1
shave	1
by	1
the	1
sunlight;	1
but	1
since	1
your	1
shaving	1
is	1
less	1
and	1
less	1
complete	1
as	1
we	1
get	1
farther	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
side,	1
until	1
it	1
becomes	1
positively	1
slovenly	1
as	1
we	1
get	1
round	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
jaw,	1
it	1
is	1
surely	1
very	1
clear	1
that	1
that	1
side	1
is	1
less	1
illuminated	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
your	1
habits	1
looking	1
at	1
himself	1
in	1
an	1
equal	1
light	1
and	1
being	1
satisfied	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
result.	1
I	1
only	1
quote	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
trivial	1
example	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
inference.	1
Therein	1
lies	1
my	1
métier,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
investigation	1
which	1
lies	1
before	1
us.	1
There	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
minor	1
points	1
which	1
were	1
brought	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
inquest,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
worth	1
considering."	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
they?"	1
	1
"It	1
appears	1
that	1
his	1
arrest	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
at	1
once,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
return	1
to	1
Hatherley	1
Farm.	1
On	1
the	1
inspector	1
of	1
constabulary	1
informing	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
remarked	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
deserts.	1
This	1
observation	1
of	1
his	1
had	1
the	1
natural	1
effect	1
of	1
removing	1
any	1
traces	1
of	1
doubt	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
coroner's	1
jury."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
confession,"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"No,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
protestation	1
of	1
innocence."	1
	1
"Coming	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
damning	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
most	1
suspicious	1
remark."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"it	1
is	1
the	1
brightest	1
rift	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
at	1
present	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
clouds.	1
However	1
innocent	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
an	1
absolute	1
imbecile	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
circumstances	1
were	1
very	1
black	1
against	1
him.	1
Had	1
he	1
appeared	1
surprised	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
arrest,	1
or	1
feigned	1
indignation	1
at	1
it,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
highly	1
suspicious,	1
because	1
such	1
surprise	1
or	1
anger	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
natural	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
yet	1
might	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
policy	1
to	1
a	1
scheming	1
man.	1
His	1
frank	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
marks	1
him	1
as	1
either	1
an	1
innocent	1
man,	1
or	1
else	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
considerable	1
self-restraint	1
and	1
firmness.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
remark	1
about	1
his	1
deserts,	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
not	1
unnatural	1
if	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
he	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
that	1
very	1
day	1
so	1
far	1
forgotten	1
his	1
filial	1
duty	1
as	1
to	1
bandy	1
words	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
even,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
whose	1
evidence	1
is	1
so	1
important,	1
to	1
raise	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
strike	1
him.	1
The	1
self-reproach	1
and	1
contrition	1
which	1
are	1
displayed	1
in	1
his	1
remark	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
mind	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
guilty	1
one."	1
	1
I	1
shook	1
my	1
head.	1
"Many	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
hanged	1
on	1
far	1
slighter	1
evidence,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
have.	1
And	1
many	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
wrongfully	1
hanged."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
own	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
not	1
very	1
encouraging	1
to	1
his	1
supporters,	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
points	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
are	1
suggestive.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
here,	1
and	1
may	1
read	1
it	1
for	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
picked	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
bundle	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
Herefordshire	1
paper,	1
and	1
having	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
sheet	1
he	1
pointed	1
out	1
the	1
paragraph	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
own	1
statement	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
I	1
settled	1
myself	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
very	1
carefully.	1
It	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
	1
"Mr.	1
James	1
McCarthy,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
deceased,	1
was	1
then	1
called	1
and	1
gave	1
evidence	1
as	1
follows:	1
'I	1
had	1
been	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
upon	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
last	1
Monday,	1
the	1
3rd.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
absent	1
from	1
home	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
arrival,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
informed	1
by	1
the	1
maid	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
over	1
to	1
Ross	1
with	1
John	1
Cobb,	1
the	1
groom.	1
Shortly	1
after	1
my	1
return	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
his	1
trap	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and,	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
window,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
get	1
out	1
and	1
walk	1
rapidly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
yard,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
in	1
which	1
direction	1
he	1
was	1
going.	1
I	1
then	1
took	1
my	1
gun	1
and	1
strolled	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
visiting	1
the	1
rabbit	1
warren	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
On	1
my	1
way	1
I	1
saw	1
William	1
Crowder,	1
the	1
game-keeper,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
stated	1
in	1
his	1
evidence;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
mistaken	1
in	1
thinking	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
following	1
my	1
father.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me.	1
When	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
pool	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
"Cooee!"	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
usual	1
signal	1
between	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
myself.	1
I	1
then	1
hurried	1
forward,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
pool.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
seeing	1
me	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
rather	1
roughly	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
there.	1
A	1
conversation	1
ensued	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
high	1
words	1
and	1
almost	1
to	1
blows,	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
violent	1
temper.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
his	1
passion	1
was	1
becoming	1
ungovernable,	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
returned	1
towards	1
Hatherley	1
Farm.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
more	1
than	1
150	1
yards,	1
however,	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
hideous	1
outcry	1
behind	1
me,	1
which	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
run	1
back	1
again.	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
father	1
expiring	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
terribly	1
injured.	1
I	1
dropped	1
my	1
gun	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
arms,	1
but	1
he	1
almost	1
instantly	1
expired.	1
I	1
knelt	1
beside	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
minutes,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Turner's	1
lodge-keeper,	1
his	1
house	1
being	1
the	1
nearest,	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
assistance.	1
I	1
saw	1
no	1
one	1
near	1
my	1
father	1
when	1
I	1
returned,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
his	1
injuries.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
popular	1
man,	1
being	1
somewhat	1
cold	1
and	1
forbidding	1
in	1
his	1
manners,	1
but	1
he	1
had,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know,	1
no	1
active	1
enemies.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
further	1
of	1
the	1
matter.'	1
	1
"The	1
Coroner:	1
Did	1
your	1

make	1
any	1

to	1
you	1
before	1
he	1

	1
"Witness:	1
He	1
mumbled	1
a	1

a	1

	1
"The	1
Coroner:	1

before	1
he	1

	1
"Witness	1

	1

	1
"Witness:	1
Nothing	1
definite.	1
	1
"The	1
Coroner:	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?	1
	1
"Witness:	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
disturbed	1
and	1
excited	1
as	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
except	1
of	1
my	1
father.	1
Yet	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
vague	1
impression	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
ran	1
forward	1
something	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
me.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
grey	1
in	1
colour,	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
or	1
a	1
plaid	1
perhaps.	1
When	1
I	1
rose	1
from	1
my	1
father	1
I	1
looked	1
round	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
gone.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
it	1
disappeared	1
before	1
you	1
went	1
for	1
help?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
gone.'	1
	1
"'You	1
cannot	1
say	1
what	1
it	1
was?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
feeling	1
something	1
was	1
there.'	1
	1
"'How	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
body?'	1
	1
"'A	1
dozen	1
yards	1
or	1
so.'	1
	1
"'And	1
how	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood?'	1
	1
"'About	1
the	1
same.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
removed	1
it	1
was	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
within	1
a	1
dozen	1
yards	1
of	1
it?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
but	1
with	1
my	1
back	1
towards	1
it.'	1
	1
"This	1
concluded	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
witness."	1
	1
"I	1
see,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
I	1
glanced	1
down	1
the	1
column,	1
"that	1
the	1
coroner	1
in	1
his	1
concluding	1
remarks	1
was	1
rather	1
severe	1
upon	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
He	1
calls	1
attention,	1
and	1
with	1
reason,	1
to	1
the	1
discrepancy	1
about	1
his	1
father	1
having	1
signalled	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
seeing	1
him,	1
also	1
to	1
his	1
refusal	1
to	1
give	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
singular	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
dying	1
words.	1
They	1
are	1
all,	1
as	1
he	1
remarks,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
son."	1
	1
Holmes	1
laughed	1
softly	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
cushioned	1
seat.	1
"Both	1
you	1
and	1
the	1
coroner	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
some	1
pains,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"to	1
single	1
out	1
the	1
very	1
strongest	1
points	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
favour.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
alternately	1
give	1
him	1
credit	1
for	1
having	1
too	1
much	1
imagination	1
and	1
too	1
little?	1
Too	1
little,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
invent	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
quarrel	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
the	1
jury;	1
too	1
much,	1
if	1
he	1
evolved	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
inner	1
consciousness	1
anything	1
so	1
outré	1
as	1
a	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat,	1
and	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
vanishing	1
cloth.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
shall	1
approach	1
this	1
case	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
that	1
what	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
says	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whither	1
that	1
hypothesis	1
will	1
lead	1
us.	1
And	1
now	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
pocket	1
Petrarch,	1
and	1
not	1
another	1
word	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
this	1
case	1
until	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
action.	1
We	1
lunch	1
at	1
Swindon,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
four	1
o'clock	1
when	1
we	1
at	1
last,	1
after	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Stroud	1
Valley,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
broad	1
gleaming	1
Severn,	1
found	1
ourselves	1
at	1
the	1
pretty	1
little	1
country-town	1
of	1
Ross.	1
A	1
lean,	1
ferret-like	1
man,	1
furtive	1
and	1
sly-looking,	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
us	1
upon	1
the	1
platform.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
brown	1
dustcoat	1
and	1
leather-leggings	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
in	1
deference	1
to	1
his	1
rustic	1
surroundings,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
recognising	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard.	1
With	1
him	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Hereford	1
Arms	1
where	1
a	1
room	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
engaged	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
ordered	1
a	1
carriage,"	1
said	1
Lestrade	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
over	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
"I	1
knew	1
your	1
energetic	1
nature,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
happy	1
until	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
crime."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
complimentary	1
of	1
you,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"It	1
is	1
entirely	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
barometric	1
pressure."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
looked	1
startled.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
quite	1
follow,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
glass?	1
Twenty-nine,	1
I	1
see.	1
No	1
wind,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
cloud	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
caseful	1
of	1
cigarettes	1
here	1
which	1
need	1
smoking,	1
and	1
the	1
sofa	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
country	1
hotel	1
abomination.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
use	1
the	1
carriage	1
to-night."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
laughed	1
indulgently.	1
"You	1
have,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
already	1
formed	1
your	1
conclusions	1
from	1
the	1
newspapers,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"The	1
case	1
is	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
a	1
pikestaff,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
one	1
goes	1
into	1
it	1
the	1
plainer	1
it	1
becomes.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
one	1
can't	1
refuse	1
a	1
lady,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
positive	1
one,	1
too.	1
She	1
has	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
your	1
opinion,	1
though	1
I	1
repeatedly	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
which	1
you	1
could	1
do	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
already	1
done.	1
Why,	1
bless	1
my	1
soul!	1
here	1
is	1
her	1
carriage	1
at	1
the	1
door."	1
	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
spoken	1
before	1
there	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
lovely	1
young	1
women	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Her	1
violet	1
eyes	1
shining,	1
her	1
lips	1
parted,	1
a	1
pink	1
flush	1
upon	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
all	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
natural	1
reserve	1
lost	1
in	1
her	1
overpowering	1
excitement	1
and	1
concern.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
glancing	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
finally,	1
with	1
a	1
woman's	1
quick	1
intuition,	1
fastening	1
upon	1
my	1
companion,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
come.	1
I	1
have	1
driven	1
down	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
so.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
James	1
didn't	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
start	1
upon	1
your	1
work	1
knowing	1
it,	1
too.	1
Never	1
let	1
yourself	1
doubt	1
upon	1
that	1
point.	1
We	1
have	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
faults	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
does;	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
tender-hearted	1
to	1
hurt	1
a	1
fly.	1
Such	1
a	1
charge	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
really	1
knows	1
him."	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
may	1
clear	1
him,	1
Miss	1
Turner,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
may	1
rely	1
upon	1
my	1
doing	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
evidence.	1
You	1
have	1
formed	1
some	1
conclusion?	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
see	1
some	1
loophole,	1
some	1
flaw?	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
yourself	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
probable."	1
	1
"There,	1
now!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
throwing	1
back	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
defiantly	1
at	1
Lestrade.	1
"You	1
hear!	1
He	1
gives	1
me	1
hopes."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
my	1
colleague	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
quick	1
in	1
forming	1
his	1
conclusions,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
is	1
right.	1
Oh!	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
right.	1
James	1
never	1
did	1
it.	1
And	1
about	1
his	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
speak	1
about	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
coroner	1
was	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
concerned	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"In	1
what	1
way?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
hide	1
anything.	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
many	1
disagreements	1
about	1
me.	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
marriage	1
between	1
us.	1
James	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
loved	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
brother	1
and	1
sister;	1
but	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
is	1
young	1
and	1
has	1
seen	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
life	1
yet,	1
and--and--well,	1
he	1
naturally	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
like	1
that	1
yet.	1
So	1
there	1
were	1
quarrels,	1
and	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"And	1
your	1
father?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
"Was	1
he	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
union?"	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
it	1
also.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
it."	1
A	1
quick	1
blush	1
passed	1
over	1
her	1
fresh	1
young	1
face	1
as	1
Holmes	1
shot	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
keen,	1
questioning	1
glances	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
for	1
this	1
information,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"May	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
father	1
if	1
I	1
call	1
to-morrow?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
the	1
doctor	1
won't	1
allow	1
it."	1
	1
"The	1
doctor?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
heard?	1
Poor	1
father	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
strong	1
for	1
years	1
back,	1
but	1
this	1
has	1
broken	1
him	1
down	1
completely.	1
He	1
has	1
taken	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Willows	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
wreck	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
nervous	1
system	1
is	1
shattered.	1
Mr.	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
alive	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
dad	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
days	1
in	1
Victoria."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
In	1
Victoria!	1
That	1
is	1
important."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
at	1
the	1
mines."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so;	1
at	1
the	1
gold-mines,	1
where,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
Mr.	1
Turner	1
made	1
his	1
money."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
certainly."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Turner.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
material	1
assistance	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
news	1
to-morrow.	1
No	1
doubt	1
you	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
see	1
James.	1
Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
do	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
innocent."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
Miss	1
Turner."	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
home	1
now,	1
for	1
dad	1
is	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
he	1
misses	1
me	1
so	1
if	1
I	1
leave	1
him.	1
Good-bye,	1
and	1
God	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
undertaking."	1
She	1
hurried	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
impulsively	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
entered,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
her	1
carriage	1
rattle	1
off	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you,	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
dignity	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
silence.	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
raise	1
up	1
hopes	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
disappoint?	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
over-tender	1
of	1
heart,	1
but	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
cruel."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
clearing	1
James	1
McCarthy,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Have	1
you	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
prison?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
reconsider	1
my	1
resolution	1
about	1
going	1
out.	1
We	1
have	1
still	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
train	1
to	1
Hereford	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"Ample."	1
	1
"Then	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
so.	1
Watson,	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
very	1
slow,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
be	1
away	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours."	1
	1
I	1
walked	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
wandered	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
town,	1
finally	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
hotel,	1
where	1
I	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
interest	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
yellow-backed	1
novel.	1
The	1
puny	1
plot	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
so	1
thin,	1
however,	1
when	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
deep	1
mystery	1
through	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
groping,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
attention	1
wander	1
so	1
continually	1
from	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
I	1
at	1
last	1
flung	1
it	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
gave	1
myself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
a	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Supposing	1
that	1
this	1
unhappy	1
young	1
man's	1
story	1
were	1
absolutely	1
true,	1
then	1
what	1
hellish	1
thing,	1
what	1
absolutely	1
unforeseen	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
calamity	1
could	1
have	1
occurred	1
between	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
parted	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
when,	1
drawn	1
back	1
by	1
his	1
screams,	1
he	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
glade?	1
It	1
was	1
something	1
terrible	1
and	1
deadly.	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
be?	1
Might	1
not	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
injuries	1
reveal	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
medical	1
instincts?	1
I	1
rang	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
weekly	1
county	1
paper,	1
which	1
contained	1
a	1
verbatim	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
inquest.	1
In	1
the	1
surgeon's	1
deposition	1
it	1
was	1
stated	1
that	1
the	1
posterior	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
parietal	1
bone	1
and	1
the	1
left	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
occipital	1
bone	1
had	1
been	1
shattered	1
by	1
a	1
heavy	1
blow	1
from	1
a	1
blunt	1
weapon.	1
I	1
marked	1
the	1
spot	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
head.	1
Clearly	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
struck	1
from	1
behind.	1
That	1
was	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
accused,	1
as	1
when	1
seen	1
quarrelling	1
he	1
was	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
father.	1
Still,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
for	1
very	1
much,	1
for	1
the	1
older	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
before	1
the	1
blow	1
fell.	1
Still,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
call	1
Holmes'	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
peculiar	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat.	1
What	1
could	1
that	1
mean?	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
delirium.	1
A	1
man	1
dying	1
from	1
a	1
sudden	1
blow	1
does	1
not	1
commonly	1
become	1
delirious.	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
he	1
met	1
his	1
fate.	1
But	1
what	1
could	1
it	1
indicate?	1
I	1
cudgelled	1
my	1
brains	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
possible	1
explanation.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
grey	1
cloth	1
seen	1
by	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
If	1
that	1
were	1
true	1
the	1
murderer	1
must	1
have	1
dropped	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
dress,	1
presumably	1
his	1
overcoat,	1
in	1
his	1
flight,	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
hardihood	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
instant	1
when	1
the	1
son	1
was	1
kneeling	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned	1
not	1
a	1
dozen	1
paces	1
off.	1
What	1
a	1
tissue	1
of	1
mysteries	1
and	1
improbabilities	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
was!	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wonder	1
at	1
Lestrade's	1
opinion,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
faith	1
in	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
insight	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
lose	1
hope	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
every	1
fresh	1
fact	1
seemed	1
to	1
strengthen	1
his	1
conviction	1
of	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
innocence.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
before	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
returned.	1
He	1
came	1
back	1
alone,	1
for	1
Lestrade	1
was	1
staying	1
in	1
lodgings	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
"The	1
glass	1
still	1
keeps	1
very	1
high,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
down.	1
"It	1
is	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
rain	1
before	1
we	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
ground.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
very	1
best	1
and	1
keenest	1
for	1
such	1
nice	1
work	1
as	1
that,	1
and	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
when	1
fagged	1
by	1
a	1
long	1
journey.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
young	1
McCarthy."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
learn	1
from	1
him?"	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"Could	1
he	1
throw	1
no	1
light?"	1
	1
"None	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
and	1
was	1
screening	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
puzzled	1
as	1
everyone	1
else.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
quick-witted	1
youth,	1
though	1
comely	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
and,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
sound	1
at	1
heart."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
admire	1
his	1
taste,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"if	1
it	1
is	1
indeed	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
a	1
marriage	1
with	1
so	1
charming	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
as	1
this	1
Miss	1
Turner."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
thereby	1
hangs	1
a	1
rather	1
painful	1
tale.	1
This	1
fellow	1
is	1
madly,	1
insanely,	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her,	1
but	1
some	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
lad,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
really	1
knew	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
away	1
five	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
boarding-school,	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
idiot	1
do	1
but	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
a	1
barmaid	1
in	1
Bristol	1
and	1
marry	1
her	1
at	1
a	1
registry	1
office?	1
No	1
one	1
knows	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
imagine	1
how	1
maddening	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
upbraided	1
for	1
not	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
his	1
very	1
eyes	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
knows	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
impossible.	1
It	1
was	1
sheer	1
frenzy	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
throw	1
his	1
hands	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
when	1
his	1
father,	1
at	1
their	1
last	1
interview,	1
was	1
goading	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
propose	1
to	1
Miss	1
Turner.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
supporting	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
man,	1
would	1
have	1
thrown	1
him	1
over	1
utterly	1
had	1
he	1
known	1
the	1
truth.	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
barmaid	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
Bristol,	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
Mark	1
that	1
point.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
importance.	1
Good	1
has	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
evil,	1
however,	1
for	1
the	1
barmaid,	1
finding	1
from	1
the	1
papers	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
serious	1
trouble	1
and	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
hanged,	1
has	1
thrown	1
him	1
over	1
utterly	1
and	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
husband	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
Bermuda	1
Dockyard,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
really	1
no	1
tie	1
between	1
them.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
that	1
bit	1
of	1
news	1
has	1
consoled	1
young	1
McCarthy	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
suffered."	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
innocent,	1
who	1
has	1
done	1
it?"	1
	1
"Ah!	1
who?	1
I	1
would	1
call	1
your	1
attention	1
very	1
particularly	1
to	1
two	1
points.	1
One	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
murdered	1
man	1
had	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
someone	1
at	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
someone	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
son,	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
return.	1
The	1
second	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
murdered	1
man	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
cry	1
'Cooee!'	1
before	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
returned.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
crucial	1
points	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
case	1
depends.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
George	1
Meredith,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
leave	1
all	1
minor	1
matters	1
until	1
to-morrow."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
rain,	1
as	1
Holmes	1
had	1
foretold,	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
broke	1
bright	1
and	1
cloudless.	1
At	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
Lestrade	1
called	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
we	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
and	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
serious	1
news	1
this	1
morning,"	1
Lestrade	1
observed.	1
"It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Turner,	1
of	1
the	1
Hall,	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
despaired	1
of."	1
	1
"An	1
elderly	1
man,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"About	1
sixty;	1
but	1
his	1
constitution	1
has	1
been	1
shattered	1
by	1
his	1
life	1
abroad,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
failing	1
health	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
This	1
business	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
effect	1
upon	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
McCarthy's,	1
and,	1
I	1
may	1
add,	1
a	1
great	1
benefactor	1
to	1
him,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
rent	1
free."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
That	1
is	1
interesting,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
In	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
ways	1
he	1
has	1
helped	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
about	1
here	1
speaks	1
of	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
him."	1
	1
"Really!	1
Does	1
it	1
not	1
strike	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
singular	1
that	1
this	1
McCarthy,	1
who	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
little	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
such	1
obligations	1
to	1
Turner,	1
should	1
still	1
talk	1
of	1
marrying	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
Turner's	1
daughter,	1
who	1
is,	1
presumably,	1
heiress	1
to	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
cocksure	1
manner,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
proposal	1
and	1
all	1
else	1
would	1
follow?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
strange,	1
since	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
Turner	1
himself	1
was	1
averse	1
to	1
the	1
idea.	1
The	1
daughter	1
told	1
us	1
as	1
much.	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
deduce	1
something	1
from	1
that?"	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
deductions	1
and	1
the	1
inferences,"	1
said	1
Lestrade,	1
winking	1
at	1
me.	1
"I	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
enough	1
to	1
tackle	1
facts,	1
Holmes,	1
without	1
flying	1
away	1
after	1
theories	1
and	1
fancies."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
right,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
demurely;	1
"you	1
do	1
find	1
it	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
tackle	1
the	1
facts."	1
	1
"Anyhow,	1
I	1
have	1
grasped	1
one	1
fact	1
which	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of,"	1
replied	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
some	1
warmth.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
is--"	1
	1
"That	1
McCarthy	1
senior	1
met	1
his	1
death	1
from	1
McCarthy	1
junior	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
theories	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
are	1
the	1
merest	1
moonshine."	1
	1
"Well,	1
moonshine	1
is	1
a	1
brighter	1
thing	1
than	1
fog,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
upon	1
the	1
left."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
it."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
widespread,	1
comfortable-looking	1
building,	1
two-storied,	1
slate-roofed,	1
with	1
great	1
yellow	1
blotches	1
of	1
lichen	1
upon	1
the	1
grey	1
walls.	1
The	1
drawn	1
blinds	1
and	1
the	1
smokeless	1
chimneys,	1
however,	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
stricken	1
look,	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
this	1
horror	1
still	1
lay	1
heavy	1
upon	1
it.	1
We	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
when	1
the	1
maid,	1
at	1
Holmes'	1
request,	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
boots	1
which	1
her	1
master	1
wore	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
the	1
son's,	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
pair	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
then	1
had.	1
Having	1
measured	1
these	1
very	1
carefully	1
from	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
different	1
points,	1
Holmes	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
court-yard,	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
all	1
followed	1
the	1
winding	1
track	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
transformed	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
scent	1
as	1
this.	1
Men	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
known	1
the	1
quiet	1
thinker	1
and	1
logician	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street	1
would	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
recognise	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
flushed	1
and	1
darkened.	1
His	1
brows	1
were	1
drawn	1
into	1
two	1
hard	1
black	1
lines,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
shone	1
out	1
from	1
beneath	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
steely	1
glitter.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
bent	1
downward,	1
his	1
shoulders	1
bowed,	1
his	1
lips	1
compressed,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
whipcord	1
in	1
his	1
long,	1
sinewy	1
neck.	1
His	1
nostrils	1
seemed	1
to	1
dilate	1
with	1
a	1
purely	1
animal	1
lust	1
for	1
the	1
chase,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
absolutely	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
question	1
or	1
remark	1
fell	1
unheeded	1
upon	1
his	1
ears,	1
or,	1
at	1
the	1
most,	1
only	1
provoked	1
a	1
quick,	1
impatient	1
snarl	1
in	1
reply.	1
Swiftly	1
and	1
silently	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
track	1
which	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
meadows,	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
to	1
the	1
Boscombe	1
Pool.	1
It	1
was	1
damp,	1
marshy	1
ground,	1
as	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
district,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
marks	1
of	1
many	1
feet,	1
both	1
upon	1
the	1
path	1
and	1
amid	1
the	1
short	1
grass	1
which	1
bounded	1
it	1
on	1
either	1
side.	1
Sometimes	1
Holmes	1
would	1
hurry	1
on,	1
sometimes	1
stop	1
dead,	1
and	1
once	1
he	1
made	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
detour	1
into	1
the	1
meadow.	1
Lestrade	1
and	1
I	1
walked	1
behind	1
him,	1
the	1
detective	1
indifferent	1
and	1
contemptuous,	1
while	1
I	1
watched	1
my	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
actions	1
was	1
directed	1
towards	1
a	1
definite	1
end.	1
	1
The	1
Boscombe	1
Pool,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
reed-girt	1
sheet	1
of	1
water	1
some	1
fifty	1
yards	1
across,	1
is	1
situated	1
at	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
Hatherley	1
Farm	1
and	1
the	1
private	1
park	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
Mr.	1
Turner.	1
Above	1
the	1
woods	1
which	1
lined	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
red,	1
jutting	1
pinnacles	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
landowner's	1
dwelling.	1
On	1
the	1
Hatherley	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pool	1
the	1
woods	1
grew	1
very	1
thick,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
narrow	1
belt	1
of	1
sodden	1
grass	1
twenty	1
paces	1
across	1
between	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
reeds	1
which	1
lined	1
the	1
lake.	1
Lestrade	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
exact	1
spot	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
so	1
moist	1
was	1
the	1
ground,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
plainly	1
see	1
the	1
traces	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
stricken	1
man.	1
To	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
and	1
peering	1
eyes,	1
very	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
upon	1
the	1
trampled	1
grass.	1
He	1
ran	1
round,	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
who	1
is	1
picking	1
up	1
a	1
scent,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
upon	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
pool	1
for?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
fished	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
rake.	1
I	1
thought	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
weapon	1
or	1
other	1
trace.	1
But	1
how	1
on	1
earth--"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
time!	1
That	1
left	1
foot	1
of	1
yours	1
with	1
its	1
inward	1
twist	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place.	1
A	1
mole	1
could	1
trace	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
vanishes	1
among	1
the	1
reeds.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
simple	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
have	1
been	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
herd	1
of	1
buffalo	1
and	1
wallowed	1
all	1
over	1
it.	1
Here	1
is	1
where	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
covered	1
all	1
tracks	1
for	1
six	1
or	1
eight	1
feet	1
round	1
the	1
body.	1
But	1
here	1
are	1
three	1
separate	1
tracks	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
feet."	1
He	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
lens	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
waterproof	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
view,	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
rather	1
to	1
himself	1
than	1
to	1
us.	1
"These	1
are	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
feet.	1
Twice	1
he	1
was	1
walking,	1
and	1
once	1
he	1
ran	1
swiftly,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
soles	1
are	1
deeply	1
marked	1
and	1
the	1
heels	1
hardly	1
visible.	1
That	1
bears	1
out	1
his	1
story.	1
He	1
ran	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
Then	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
father's	1
feet	1
as	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
What	1
is	1
this,	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
butt-end	1
of	1
the	1
gun	1
as	1
the	1
son	1
stood	1
listening.	1
And	1
this?	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
here?	1
Tiptoes!	1
tiptoes!	1
Square,	1
too,	1
quite	1
unusual	1
boots!	1
They	1
come,	1
they	1
go,	1
they	1
come	1
again--of	1
course	1
that	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
cloak.	1
Now	1
where	1
did	1
they	1
come	1
from?"	1
He	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
sometimes	1
losing,	1
sometimes	1
finding	1
the	1
track	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
well	1
within	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
beech,	1
the	1
largest	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
Holmes	1
traced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
satisfaction.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
remained	1
there,	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
dried	1
sticks,	1
gathering	1
up	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
dust	1
into	1
an	1
envelope	1
and	1
examining	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
ground	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
bark	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
reach.	1
A	1
jagged	1
stone	1
was	1
lying	1
among	1
the	1
moss,	1
and	1
this	1
also	1
he	1
carefully	1
examined	1
and	1
retained.	1
Then	1
he	1
followed	1
a	1
pathway	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
highroad,	1
where	1
all	1
traces	1
were	1
lost.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
considerable	1
interest,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
natural	1
manner.	1
"I	1
fancy	1
that	1
this	1
grey	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
lodge.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
Moran,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
write	1
a	1
little	1
note.	1
Having	1
done	1
that,	1
we	1
may	1
drive	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
luncheon.	1
You	1
may	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
presently."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
before	1
we	1
regained	1
our	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
back	1
into	1
Ross,	1
Holmes	1
still	1
carrying	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
picked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
"This	1
may	1
interest	1
you,	1
Lestrade,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
holding	1
it	1
out.	1
"The	1
murder	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
no	1
marks."	1
	1
"There	1
are	1
none."	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
grass	1
was	1
growing	1
under	1
it.	1
It	1
had	1
only	1
lain	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
whence	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
taken.	1
It	1
corresponds	1
with	1
the	1
injuries.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
weapon."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
murderer?"	1
	1
"Is	1
a	1
tall	1
man,	1
left-handed,	1
limps	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
leg,	1
wears	1
thick-soled	1
shooting-boots	1
and	1
a	1
grey	1
cloak,	1
smokes	1
Indian	1
cigars,	1
uses	1
a	1
cigar-holder,	1
and	1
carries	1
a	1
blunt	1
pen-knife	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
other	1
indications,	1
but	1
these	1
may	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
aid	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
search."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
a	1
sceptic,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Theories	1
are	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
a	1
hard-headed	1
British	1
jury."	1
	1
"Nous	1
verrons,"	1
answered	1
Holmes	1
calmly.	1
"You	1
work	1
your	1
own	1
method,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
work	1
mine.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
busy	1
this	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
shall	1
probably	1
return	1
to	1
London	1
by	1
the	1
evening	1
train."	1
	1
"And	1
leave	1
your	1
case	1
unfinished?"	1
	1
"No,	1
finished."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
mystery?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
solved."	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
the	1
criminal,	1
then?"	1
	1
"The	1
gentleman	1
I	1
describe."	1
	1
"But	1
who	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"Surely	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
out.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
populous	1
neighbourhood."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
practical	1
man,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"and	1
I	1
really	1
cannot	1
undertake	1
to	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
country	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
left-handed	1
gentleman	1
with	1
a	1
game	1
leg.	1
I	1
should	1
become	1
the	1
laughing-stock	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard."	1
	1
"All	1
right,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
"I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
chance.	1
Here	1
are	1
your	1
lodgings.	1
Good-bye.	1
I	1
shall	1
drop	1
you	1
a	1
line	1
before	1
I	1
leave."	1
	1
Having	1
left	1
Lestrade	1
at	1
his	1
rooms,	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
our	1
hotel,	1
where	1
we	1
found	1
lunch	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Holmes	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
buried	1
in	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
pained	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
perplexing	1
position.	1
	1
"Look	1
here,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
when	1
the	1
cloth	1
was	1
cleared	1
"just	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
this	1
chair	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
preach	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
little.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
quite	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
value	1
your	1
advice.	1
Light	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
expound."	1
	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"Well,	1
now,	1
in	1
considering	1
this	1
case	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
points	1
about	1
young	1
McCarthy's	1
narrative	1
which	1
struck	1
us	1
both	1
instantly,	1
although	1
they	1
impressed	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
and	1
you	1
against	1
him.	1
One	1
was	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
should,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
account,	1
cry	1
'Cooee!'	1
before	1
seeing	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
was	1
his	1
singular	1
dying	1
reference	1
to	1
a	1
rat.	1
He	1
mumbled	1
several	1
words,	1
you	1
understand,	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
caught	1
the	1
son's	1
ear.	1
Now	1
from	1
this	1
double	1
point	1
our	1
research	1
must	1
commence,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
begin	1
it	1
by	1
presuming	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
lad	1
says	1
is	1
absolutely	1
true."	1
	1
"What	1
of	1
this	1
'Cooee!'	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
obviously	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
meant	1
for	1
the	1
son.	1
The	1
son,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
knew,	1
was	1
in	1
Bristol.	1
It	1
was	1
mere	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
earshot.	1
The	1
'Cooee!'	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
attract	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
whoever	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
appointment	1
with.	1
But	1
'Cooee'	1
is	1
a	1
distinctly	1
Australian	1
cry,	1
and	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
used	1
between	1
Australians.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
presumption	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
whom	1
McCarthy	1
expected	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
Boscombe	1
Pool	1
was	1
someone	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Australia."	1
	1
"What	1
of	1
the	1
rat,	1
then?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
took	1
a	1
folded	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
flattened	1
it	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
Colony	1
of	1
Victoria,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
wired	1
to	1
Bristol	1
for	1
it	1
last	1
night."	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
map.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
read?"	1
	1
"ARAT,"	1
I	1
read.	1
	1
"And	1
now?"	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"BALLARAT."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
the	1
man	1
uttered,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
son	1
only	1
caught	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
syllables.	1
He	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
murderer.	1
So	1
and	1
so,	1
of	1
Ballarat."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
wonderful!"	1
I	1
exclaimed.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
obvious.	1
And	1
now,	1
you	1
see,	1
I	1
had	1
narrowed	1
the	1
field	1
down	1
considerably.	1
The	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
grey	1
garment	1
was	1
a	1
third	1
point	1
which,	1
granting	1
the	1
son's	1
statement	1
to	1
be	1
correct,	1
was	1
a	1
certainty.	1
We	1
have	1
come	1
now	1
out	1
of	1
mere	1
vagueness	1
to	1
the	1
definite	1
conception	1
of	1
an	1
Australian	1
from	1
Ballarat	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
cloak."	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"And	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
district,	1
for	1
the	1
pool	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
approached	1
by	1
the	1
farm	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
estate,	1
where	1
strangers	1
could	1
hardly	1
wander."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so."	1
	1
"Then	1
comes	1
our	1
expedition	1
of	1
to-day.	1
By	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
I	1
gained	1
the	1
trifling	1
details	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
to	1
that	1
imbecile	1
Lestrade,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
the	1
criminal."	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
gain	1
them?"	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
method.	1
It	1
is	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
trifles."	1
	1
"His	1
height	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
roughly	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
stride.	1
His	1
boots,	1
too,	1
might	1
be	1
told	1
from	1
their	1
traces."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
were	1
peculiar	1
boots."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
lameness?"	1
	1
"The	1
impression	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
foot	1
was	1
always	1
less	1
distinct	1
than	1
his	1
left.	1
He	1
put	1
less	1
weight	1
upon	1
it.	1
Why?	1
Because	1
he	1
limped--he	1
was	1
lame."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
left-handedness."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
yourself	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
injury	1
as	1
recorded	1
by	1
the	1
surgeon	1
at	1
the	1
inquest.	1
The	1
blow	1
was	1
struck	1
from	1
immediately	1
behind,	1
and	1
yet	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side.	1
Now,	1
how	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
a	1
left-handed	1
man?	1
He	1
had	1
stood	1
behind	1
that	1
tree	1
during	1
the	1
interview	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
He	1
had	1
even	1
smoked	1
there.	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
ash	1
of	1
a	1
cigar,	1
which	1
my	1
special	1
knowledge	1
of	1
tobacco	1
ashes	1
enables	1
me	1
to	1
pronounce	1
as	1
an	1
Indian	1
cigar.	1
I	1
have,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
devoted	1
some	1
attention	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
written	1
a	1
little	1
monograph	1
on	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
140	1
different	1
varieties	1
of	1
pipe,	1
cigar,	1
and	1
cigarette	1
tobacco.	1
Having	1
found	1
the	1
ash,	1
I	1
then	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
discovered	1
the	1
stump	1
among	1
the	1
moss	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
tossed	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
Indian	1
cigar,	1
of	1
the	1
variety	1
which	1
are	1
rolled	1
in	1
Rotterdam."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
cigar-holder?"	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Therefore	1
he	1
used	1
a	1
holder.	1
The	1
tip	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off,	1
not	1
bitten	1
off,	1
but	1
the	1
cut	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
clean	1
one,	1
so	1
I	1
deduced	1
a	1
blunt	1
pen-knife."	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
said,	1
"you	1
have	1
drawn	1
a	1
net	1
round	1
this	1
man	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
escape,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
saved	1
an	1
innocent	1
human	1
life	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
cut	1
the	1
cord	1
which	1
was	1
hanging	1
him.	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
this	1
points.	1
The	1
culprit	1
is--"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
John	1
Turner,"	1
cried	1
the	1
hotel	1
waiter,	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
our	1
sitting-room,	1
and	1
ushering	1
in	1
a	1
visitor.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
impressive	1
figure.	1
His	1
slow,	1
limping	1
step	1
and	1
bowed	1
shoulders	1
gave	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
decrepitude,	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
hard,	1
deep-lined,	1
craggy	1
features,	1
and	1
his	1
enormous	1
limbs	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
unusual	1
strength	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
of	1
character.	1
His	1
tangled	1
beard,	1
grizzled	1
hair,	1
and	1
outstanding,	1
drooping	1
eyebrows	1
combined	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
dignity	1
and	1
power	1
to	1
his	1
appearance,	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
ashen	1
white,	1
while	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
nostrils	1
were	1
tinged	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
blue.	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
grip	1
of	1
some	1
deadly	1
and	1
chronic	1
disease.	1
	1
"Pray	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gently.	1
"You	1
had	1
my	1
note?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
lodge-keeper	1
brought	1
it	1
up.	1
You	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
here	1
to	1
avoid	1
scandal."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
people	1
would	1
talk	1
if	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Hall."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
me?"	1
He	1
looked	1
across	1
at	1
my	1
companion	1
with	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
weary	1
eyes,	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
question	1
was	1
already	1
answered.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
answering	1
the	1
look	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
words.	1
"It	1
is	1
so.	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
McCarthy."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
"God	1
help	1
me!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"But	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
come	1
to	1
harm.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
if	1
it	1
went	1
against	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
Assizes."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
you	1
say	1
so,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gravely.	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
have	1
spoken	1
now	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
my	1
dear	1
girl.	1
It	1
would	1
break	1
her	1
heart--it	1
will	1
break	1
her	1
heart	1
when	1
she	1
hears	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
arrested."	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
that,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"What?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
no	1
official	1
agent.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
daughter	1
who	1
required	1
my	1
presence	1
here,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
acting	1
in	1
her	1
interests.	1
Young	1
McCarthy	1
must	1
be	1
got	1
off,	1
however."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
dying	1
man,"	1
said	1
old	1
Turner.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
diabetes	1
for	1
years.	1
My	1
doctor	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
live	1
a	1
month.	1
Yet	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
die	1
under	1
my	1
own	1
roof	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
gaol."	1
	1
Holmes	1
rose	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
paper	1
before	1
him.	1
"Just	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
truth,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"I	1
shall	1
jot	1
down	1
the	1
facts.	1
You	1
will	1
sign	1
it,	1
and	1
Watson	1
here	1
can	1
witness	1
it.	1
Then	1
I	1
could	1
produce	1
your	1
confession	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
extremity	1
to	1
save	1
young	1
McCarthy.	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
use	1
it	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
needed."	1
	1
"It's	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
"it's	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
live	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes,	1
so	1
it	1
matters	1
little	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
spare	1
Alice	1
the	1
shock.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
thing	1
clear	1
to	1
you;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
acting,	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
long	1
to	1
tell.	1
	1
"You	1
didn't	1
know	1
this	1
dead	1
man,	1
McCarthy.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
devil	1
incarnate.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that.	1
God	1
keep	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
clutches	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
he.	1
His	1
grip	1
has	1
been	1
upon	1
me	1
these	1
twenty	1
years,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
blasted	1
my	1
life.	1
I'll	1
tell	1
you	1
first	1
how	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
'60's	1
at	1
the	1
diggings.	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
chap	1
then,	1
hot-blooded	1
and	1
reckless,	1
ready	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
hand	1
at	1
anything;	1
I	1
got	1
among	1
bad	1
companions,	1
took	1
to	1
drink,	1
had	1
no	1
luck	1
with	1
my	1
claim,	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
bush,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
became	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
call	1
over	1
here	1
a	1
highway	1
robber.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
wild,	1
free	1
life	1
of	1
it,	1
sticking	1
up	1
a	1
station	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
or	1
stopping	1
the	1
wagons	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
diggings.	1
Black	1
Jack	1
of	1
Ballarat	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
I	1
went	1
under,	1
and	1
our	1
party	1
is	1
still	1
remembered	1
in	1
the	1
colony	1
as	1
the	1
Ballarat	1
Gang.	1
	1
"One	1
day	1
a	1
gold	1
convoy	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Ballarat	1
to	1
Melbourne,	1
and	1
we	1
lay	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
attacked	1
it.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
troopers	1
and	1
six	1
of	1
us,	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
close	1
thing,	1
but	1
we	1
emptied	1
four	1
of	1
their	1
saddles	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
volley.	1
Three	1
of	1
our	1
boys	1
were	1
killed,	1
however,	1
before	1
we	1
got	1
the	1
swag.	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
pistol	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
wagon-driver,	1
who	1
was	1
this	1
very	1
man	1
McCarthy.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
shot	1
him	1
then,	1
but	1
I	1
spared	1
him,	1
though	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
wicked	1
little	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
remember	1
every	1
feature.	1
We	1
got	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
gold,	1
became	1
wealthy	1
men,	1
and	1
made	1
our	1
way	1
over	1
to	1
England	1
without	1
being	1
suspected.	1
There	1
I	1
parted	1
from	1
my	1
old	1
pals	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
respectable	1
life.	1
I	1
bought	1
this	1
estate,	1
which	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
market,	1
and	1
I	1
set	1
myself	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
little	1
good	1
with	1
my	1
money,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
earned	1
it.	1
I	1
married,	1
too,	1
and	1
though	1
my	1
wife	1
died	1
young	1
she	1
left	1
me	1
my	1
dear	1
little	1
Alice.	1
Even	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
baby	1
her	1
wee	1
hand	1
seemed	1
to	1
lead	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
right	1
path	1
as	1
nothing	1
else	1
had	1
ever	1
done.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
turned	1
over	1
a	1
new	1
leaf	1
and	1
did	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
past.	1
All	1
was	1
going	1
well	1
when	1
McCarthy	1
laid	1
his	1
grip	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
town	1
about	1
an	1
investment,	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
Regent	1
Street	1
with	1
hardly	1
a	1
coat	1
to	1
his	1
back	1
or	1
a	1
boot	1
to	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
"'Here	1
we	1
are,	1
Jack,'	1
says	1
he,	1
touching	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
arm;	1
'we'll	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
to	1
you.	1
There's	1
two	1
of	1
us,	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
us.	1
If	1
you	1
don't--it's	1
a	1
fine,	1
law-abiding	1
country	1
is	1
England,	1
and	1
there's	1
always	1
a	1
policeman	1
within	1
hail.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
down	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
west	1
country,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shaking	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
have	1
lived	1
rent	1
free	1
on	1
my	1
best	1
land	1
ever	1
since.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
rest	1
for	1
me,	1
no	1
peace,	1
no	1
forgetfulness;	1
turn	1
where	1
I	1
would,	1
there	1
was	1
his	1
cunning,	1
grinning	1
face	1
at	1
my	1
elbow.	1
It	1
grew	1
worse	1
as	1
Alice	1
grew	1
up,	1
for	1
he	1
soon	1
saw	1
I	1
was	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
knowing	1
my	1
past	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
police.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
wanted	1
he	1
must	1
have,	1
and	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
without	1
question,	1
land,	1
money,	1
houses,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
give.	1
He	1
asked	1
for	1
Alice.	1
	1
"His	1
son,	1
you	1
see,	1
had	1
grown	1
up,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
my	1
girl,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
weak	1
health,	1
it	1
seemed	1
a	1
fine	1
stroke	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
lad	1
should	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
whole	1
property.	1
But	1
there	1
I	1
was	1
firm.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
his	1
cursed	1
stock	1
mixed	1
with	1
mine;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
dislike	1
to	1
the	1
lad,	1
but	1
his	1
blood	1
was	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
enough.	1
I	1
stood	1
firm.	1
McCarthy	1
threatened.	1
I	1
braved	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
worst.	1
We	1
were	1
to	1
meet	1
at	1
the	1
pool	1
midway	1
between	1
our	1
houses	1
to	1
talk	1
it	1
over.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
there	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
talking	1
with	1
his	1
son,	1
so	1
I	1
smoked	1
a	1
cigar	1
and	1
waited	1
behind	1
a	1
tree	1
until	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
alone.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
talk	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
black	1
and	1
bitter	1
in	1
me	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
uppermost.	1
He	1
was	1
urging	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter	1
with	1
as	1
little	1
regard	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
a	1
slut	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
streets.	1
It	1
drove	1
me	1
mad	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
held	1
most	1
dear	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
this.	1
Could	1
I	1
not	1
snap	1
the	1
bond?	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
a	1
dying	1
and	1
a	1
desperate	1
man.	1
Though	1
clear	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
fairly	1
strong	1
of	1
limb,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
fate	1
was	1
sealed.	1
But	1
my	1
memory	1
and	1
my	1
girl!	1
Both	1
could	1
be	1
saved	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
silence	1
that	1
foul	1
tongue.	1
I	1
did	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
it	1
again.	1
Deeply	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
sinned,	1
I	1
have	1
led	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
martyrdom	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
that	1
my	1
girl	1
should	1
be	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
meshes	1
which	1
held	1
me	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
suffer.	1
I	1
struck	1
him	1
down	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
compunction	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
foul	1
and	1
venomous	1
beast.	1
His	1
cry	1
brought	1
back	1
his	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
cloak	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
dropped	1
in	1
my	1
flight.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
story,	1
gentlemen,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
occurred."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
judge	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
signed	1
the	1
statement	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
out.	1
"I	1
pray	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
temptation."	1
	1
"I	1
pray	1
not,	1
sir.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
intend	1
to	1
do?"	1
	1
"In	1
view	1
of	1
your	1
health,	1
nothing.	1
You	1
are	1
yourself	1
aware	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
your	1
deed	1
at	1
a	1
higher	1
court	1
than	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
your	1
confession,	1
and	1
if	1
McCarthy	1
is	1
condemned	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
use	1
it.	1
If	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
mortal	1
eye;	1
and	1
your	1
secret,	1
whether	1
you	1
be	1
alive	1
or	1
dead,	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
"Farewell,	1
then,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
solemnly.	1
"Your	1
own	1
deathbeds,	1
when	1
they	1
come,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
easier	1
for	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
mine."	1
Tottering	1
and	1
shaking	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
giant	1
frame,	1
he	1
stumbled	1
slowly	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"God	1
help	1
us!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence.	1
"Why	1
does	1
fate	1
play	1
such	1
tricks	1
with	1
poor,	1
helpless	1
worms?	1
I	1
never	1
hear	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Baxter's	1
words,	1
and	1
say,	1
'There,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
goes	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.'"	1
	1
James	1
McCarthy	1
was	1
acquitted	1
at	1
the	1
Assizes	1
on	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
objections	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
out	1
by	1
Holmes	1
and	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
defending	1
counsel.	1
Old	1
Turner	1
lived	1
for	1
seven	1
months	1
after	1
our	1
interview,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
dead;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
every	1
prospect	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
and	1
daughter	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
live	1
happily	1
together	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
cloud	1
which	1
rests	1
upon	1
their	1
past.	1
	1
	1
	1
ADVENTURE	1
V.	1
THE	1
FIVE	1
ORANGE	1
PIPS	1
	1
When	1
I	1
glance	1
over	1
my	1
notes	1
and	1
records	1
of	1
the	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
cases	1
between	1
the	1
years	1
'82	1
and	1
'90,	1
I	1
am	1
faced	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
which	1
present	1
strange	1
and	1
interesting	1
features	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
know	1
which	1
to	1
choose	1
and	1
which	1
to	1
leave.	1
Some,	1
however,	1
have	1
already	1
gained	1
publicity	1
through	1
the	1
papers,	1
and	1
others	1
have	1
not	1
offered	1
a	1
field	1
for	1
those	1
peculiar	1
qualities	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
possessed	1
in	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
degree,	1
and	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
to	1
illustrate.	1
Some,	1
too,	1
have	1
baffled	1
his	1
analytical	1
skill,	1
and	1
would	1
be,	1
as	1
narratives,	1
beginnings	1
without	1
an	1
ending,	1
while	1
others	1
have	1
been	1
but	1
partially	1
cleared	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
explanations	1
founded	1
rather	1
upon	1
conjecture	1
and	1
surmise	1
than	1
on	1
that	1
absolute	1
logical	1
proof	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
dear	1
to	1
him.	1
There	1
is,	1
however,	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
remarkable	1
in	1
its	1
details	1
and	1
so	1
startling	1
in	1
its	1
results	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
tempted	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it	1
which	1
never	1
have	1
been,	1
and	1
probably	1
never	1
will	1
be,	1
entirely	1
cleared	1
up.	1
	1
The	1
year	1
'87	1
furnished	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
cases	1
of	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
interest,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
retain	1
the	1
records.	1
Among	1
my	1
headings	1
under	1
this	1
one	1
twelve	1
months	1
I	1
find	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Paradol	1
Chamber,	1
of	1
the	1
Amateur	1
Mendicant	1
Society,	1
who	1
held	1
a	1
luxurious	1
club	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
vault	1
of	1
a	1
furniture	1
warehouse,	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
barque	1
"Sophy	1
Anderson",	1
of	1
the	1
singular	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
Grice	1
Patersons	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Uffa,	1
and	1
finally	1
of	1
the	1
Camberwell	1
poisoning	1
case.	1
In	1
the	1
latter,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
remembered,	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
able,	1
by	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
man's	1
watch,	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
wound	1
up	1
two	1
hours	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
the	1
deceased	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
within	1
that	1
time--a	1
deduction	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance	1
in	1
clearing	1
up	1
the	1
case.	1
All	1
these	1
I	1
may	1
sketch	1
out	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
date,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
present	1
such	1
singular	1
features	1
as	1
the	1
strange	1
train	1
of	1
circumstances	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
taken	1
up	1
my	1
pen	1
to	1
describe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days	1
of	1
September,	1
and	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
gales	1
had	1
set	1
in	1
with	1
exceptional	1
violence.	1
All	1
day	1
the	1
wind	1
had	1
screamed	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
had	1
beaten	1
against	1
the	1
windows,	1
so	1
that	1
even	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
great,	1
hand-made	1
London	1
we	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
raise	1
our	1
minds	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
from	1
the	1
routine	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
elemental	1
forces	1
which	1
shriek	1
at	1
mankind	1
through	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
his	1
civilisation,	1
like	1
untamed	1
beasts	1
in	1
a	1
cage.	1
As	1
evening	1
drew	1
in,	1
the	1
storm	1
grew	1
higher	1
and	1
louder,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
cried	1
and	1
sobbed	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
the	1
chimney.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
moodily	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace	1
cross-indexing	1
his	1
records	1
of	1
crime,	1
while	1
I	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
Clark	1
Russell's	1
fine	1
sea-stories	1
until	1
the	1
howl	1
of	1
the	1
gale	1
from	1
without	1
seemed	1
to	1
blend	1
with	1
the	1
text,	1
and	1
the	1
splash	1
of	1
the	1
rain	1
to	1
lengthen	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
long	1
swash	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
waves.	1
My	1
wife	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
her	1
mother's,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
dweller	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
old	1
quarters	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
I,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
my	1
companion,	1
"that	1
was	1
surely	1
the	1
bell.	1
Who	1
could	1
come	1
to-night?	1
Some	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
perhaps?"	1
	1
"Except	1
yourself	1
I	1
have	1
none,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
encourage	1
visitors."	1
	1
"A	1
client,	1
then?"	1
	1
"If	1
so,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
serious	1
case.	1
Nothing	1
less	1
would	1
bring	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
hour.	1
But	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
crony	1
of	1
the	1
landlady's."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
his	1
conjecture,	1
however,	1
for	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
step	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
and	1
a	1
tapping	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
long	1
arm	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
lamp	1
away	1
from	1
himself	1
and	1
towards	1
the	1
vacant	1
chair	1
upon	1
which	1
a	1
newcomer	1
must	1
sit.	1
	1
"Come	1
in!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
entered	1
was	1
young,	1
some	1
two-and-twenty	1
at	1
the	1
outside,	1
well-groomed	1
and	1
trimly	1
clad,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
refinement	1
and	1
delicacy	1
in	1
his	1
bearing.	1
The	1
streaming	1
umbrella	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
his	1
long	1
shining	1
waterproof	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
fierce	1
weather	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
come.	1
He	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
anxiously	1
in	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
heavy,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
weighed	1
down	1
with	1
some	1
great	1
anxiety.	1
	1
"I	1
owe	1
you	1
an	1
apology,"	1
he	1
said,	1
raising	1
his	1
golden	1
pince-nez	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
trust	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
intruding.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
some	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
and	1
rain	1
into	1
your	1
snug	1
chamber."	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
your	1
coat	1
and	1
umbrella,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"They	1
may	1
rest	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
hook	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
dry	1
presently.	1
You	1
have	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
south-west,	1
I	1
see."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
from	1
Horsham."	1
	1
"That	1
clay	1
and	1
chalk	1
mixture	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
upon	1
your	1
toe	1
caps	1
is	1
quite	1
distinctive."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
for	1
advice."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
easily	1
got."	1
	1
"And	1
help."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
so	1
easy."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
heard	1
from	1
Major	1
Prendergast	1
how	1
you	1
saved	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Tankerville	1
Club	1
scandal."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
of	1
course.	1
He	1
was	1
wrongfully	1
accused	1
of	1
cheating	1
at	1
cards."	1
	1
"He	1
said	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
solve	1
anything."	1
	1
"He	1
said	1
too	1
much."	1
	1
"That	1
you	1
are	1
never	1
beaten."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
beaten	1
four	1
times--three	1
times	1
by	1
men,	1
and	1
once	1
by	1
a	1
woman."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
successes?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
generally	1
successful."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
draw	1
your	1
chair	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
favour	1
me	1
with	1
some	1
details	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
case."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
ordinary	1
one."	1
	1
"None	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
are.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
court	1
of	1
appeal."	1
	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
question,	1
sir,	1
whether,	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
experience,	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
mysterious	1
and	1
inexplicable	1
chain	1
of	1
events	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family."	1
	1
"You	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
interest,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Pray	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
essential	1
facts	1
from	1
the	1
commencement,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
afterwards	1
question	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
details	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
important."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
pulled	1
his	1
chair	1
up	1
and	1
pushed	1
his	1
wet	1
feet	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
blaze.	1
	1
"My	1
name,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"is	1
John	1
Openshaw,	1
but	1
my	1
own	1
affairs	1
have,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
understand,	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
awful	1
business.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hereditary	1
matter;	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
facts,	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
affair.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
grandfather	1
had	1
two	1
sons--my	1
uncle	1
Elias	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
Joseph.	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
a	1
small	1
factory	1
at	1
Coventry,	1
which	1
he	1
enlarged	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
bicycling.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
patentee	1
of	1
the	1
Openshaw	1
unbreakable	1
tire,	1
and	1
his	1
business	1
met	1
with	1
such	1
success	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
sell	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
retire	1
upon	1
a	1
handsome	1
competence.	1
	1
"My	1
uncle	1
Elias	1
emigrated	1
to	1
America	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
became	1
a	1
planter	1
in	1
Florida,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
well.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
he	1
fought	1
in	1
Jackson's	1
army,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
under	1
Hood,	1
where	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
colonel.	1
When	1
Lee	1
laid	1
down	1
his	1
arms	1
my	1
uncle	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
plantation,	1
where	1
he	1
remained	1
for	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
years.	1
About	1
1869	1
or	1
1870	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Europe	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
small	1
estate	1
in	1
Sussex,	1
near	1
Horsham.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
fortune	1
in	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
leaving	1
them	1
was	1
his	1
aversion	1
to	1
the	1
negroes,	1
and	1
his	1
dislike	1
of	1
the	1
Republican	1
policy	1
in	1
extending	1
the	1
franchise	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
man,	1
fierce	1
and	1
quick-tempered,	1
very	1
foul-mouthed	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
retiring	1
disposition.	1
During	1
all	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
he	1
lived	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
ever	1
he	1
set	1
foot	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
garden	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
fields	1
round	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
exercise,	1
though	1
very	1
often	1
for	1
weeks	1
on	1
end	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
leave	1
his	1
room.	1
He	1
drank	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
smoked	1
very	1
heavily,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
no	1
society	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
friends,	1
not	1
even	1
his	1
own	1
brother.	1
	1
"He	1
didn't	1
mind	1
me;	1
in	1
fact,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
first	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
youngster	1
of	1
twelve	1
or	1
so.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1878,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
years	1
in	1
England.	1
He	1
begged	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
way.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
sober	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
playing	1
backgammon	1
and	1
draughts	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
me	1
his	1
representative	1
both	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
tradespeople,	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
sixteen	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
I	1
kept	1
all	1
the	1
keys	1
and	1
could	1
go	1
where	1
I	1
liked	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
liked,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
disturb	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
privacy.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
singular	1
exception,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
room,	1
a	1
lumber-room	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
attics,	1
which	1
was	1
invariably	1
locked,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
permit	1
either	1
me	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
to	1
enter.	1
With	1
a	1
boy's	1
curiosity	1
I	1
have	1
peeped	1
through	1
the	1
keyhole,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
than	1
such	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
old	1
trunks	1
and	1
bundles	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
expected	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
room.	1
	1
"One	1
day--it	1
was	1
in	1
March,	1
1883--a	1
letter	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
stamp	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
colonel's	1
plate.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
receive	1
letters,	1
for	1
his	1
bills	1
were	1
all	1
paid	1
in	1
ready	1
money,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
friends	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
'From	1
India!'	1
said	1
he	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
'Pondicherry	1
postmark!	1
What	1
can	1
this	1
be?'	1
Opening	1
it	1
hurriedly,	1
out	1
there	1
jumped	1
five	1
little	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips,	1
which	1
pattered	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
plate.	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
the	1
laugh	1
was	1
struck	1
from	1
my	1
lips	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
His	1
lip	1
had	1
fallen,	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
protruding,	1
his	1
skin	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
putty,	1
and	1
he	1
glared	1
at	1
the	1
envelope	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
trembling	1
hand,	1
'K.	1
K.	1
K.!'	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
and	1
then,	1
'My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
my	1
sins	1
have	1
overtaken	1
me!'	1
	1
"'What	1
is	1
it,	1
uncle?'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Death,'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
leaving	1
me	1
palpitating	1
with	1
horror.	1
I	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
envelope	1
and	1
saw	1
scrawled	1
in	1
red	1
ink	1
upon	1
the	1
inner	1
flap,	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
gum,	1
the	1
letter	1
K	1
three	1
times	1
repeated.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
save	1
the	1
five	1
dried	1
pips.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
overpowering	1
terror?	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
breakfast-table,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
ascended	1
the	1
stair	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
coming	1
down	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
rusty	1
key,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
attic,	1
in	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
brass	1
box,	1
like	1
a	1
cashbox,	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"'They	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
they	1
like,	1
but	1
I'll	1
checkmate	1
them	1
still,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
an	1
oath.	1
'Tell	1
Mary	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
to-day,	1
and	1
send	1
down	1
to	1
Fordham,	1
the	1
Horsham	1
lawyer.'	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
ordered,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
lawyer	1
arrived	1
I	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
step	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
fire	1
was	1
burning	1
brightly,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
grate	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
black,	1
fluffy	1
ashes,	1
as	1
of	1
burned	1
paper,	1
while	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
stood	1
open	1
and	1
empty	1
beside	1
it.	1
As	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
box	1
I	1
noticed,	1
with	1
a	1
start,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
lid	1
was	1
printed	1
the	1
treble	1
K	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
upon	1
the	1
envelope.	1
	1
"'I	1
wish	1
you,	1
John,'	1
said	1
my	1
uncle,	1
'to	1
witness	1
my	1
will.	1
I	1
leave	1
my	1
estate,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
advantages	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
disadvantages,	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
your	1
father,	1
whence	1
it	1
will,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
descend	1
to	1
you.	1
If	1
you	1
can	1
enjoy	1
it	1
in	1
peace,	1
well	1
and	1
good!	1
If	1
you	1
find	1
you	1
cannot,	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
my	1
boy,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
deadliest	1
enemy.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
two-edged	1
thing,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
say	1
what	1
turn	1
things	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
take.	1
Kindly	1
sign	1
the	1
paper	1
where	1
Mr.	1
Fordham	1
shows	1
you.'	1
	1
"I	1
signed	1
the	1
paper	1
as	1
directed,	1
and	1
the	1
lawyer	1
took	1
it	1
away	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
singular	1
incident	1
made,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
think,	1
the	1
deepest	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
pondered	1
over	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
every	1
way	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
Yet	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
dread	1
which	1
it	1
left	1
behind,	1
though	1
the	1
sensation	1
grew	1
less	1
keen	1
as	1
the	1
weeks	1
passed	1
and	1
nothing	1
happened	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
usual	1
routine	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
my	1
uncle,	1
however.	1
He	1
drank	1
more	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
less	1
inclined	1
for	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
society.	1
Most	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
in	1
his	1
room,	1
with	1
the	1
door	1
locked	1
upon	1
the	1
inside,	1
but	1
sometimes	1
he	1
would	1
emerge	1
in	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
drunken	1
frenzy	1
and	1
would	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
tear	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
a	1
revolver	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
screaming	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
no	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
cooped	1
up,	1
like	1
a	1
sheep	1
in	1
a	1
pen,	1
by	1
man	1
or	1
devil.	1
When	1
these	1
hot	1
fits	1
were	1
over,	1
however,	1
he	1
would	1
rush	1
tumultuously	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
lock	1
and	1
bar	1
it	1
behind	1
him,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
brazen	1
it	1
out	1
no	1
longer	1
against	1
the	1
terror	1
which	1
lies	1
at	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
At	1
such	1
times	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
face,	1
even	1
on	1
a	1
cold	1
day,	1
glisten	1
with	1
moisture,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
new	1
raised	1
from	1
a	1
basin.	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
abuse	1
your	1
patience,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
drunken	1
sallies	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
back.	1
We	1
found	1
him,	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
him,	1
face	1
downward	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
green-scummed	1
pool,	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
garden.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
water	1
was	1
but	1
two	1
feet	1
deep,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
jury,	1
having	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
known	1
eccentricity,	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'suicide.'	1
But	1
I,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
he	1
winced	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
thought	1
of	1
death,	1
had	1
much	1
ado	1
to	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
meet	1
it.	1
The	1
matter	1
passed,	1
however,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
entered	1
into	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
estate,	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
14,000	1
pounds,	1
which	1
lay	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
at	1
the	1
bank."	1
	1
"One	1
moment,"	1
Holmes	1
interposed,	1
"your	1
statement	1
is,	1
I	1
foresee,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
the	1
reception	1
by	1
your	1
uncle	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
his	1
supposed	1
suicide."	1
	1
"The	1
letter	1
arrived	1
on	1
March	1
10,	1
1883.	1
His	1
death	1
was	1
seven	1
weeks	1
later,	1
upon	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
May	1
2nd."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
Pray	1
proceed."	1
	1
"When	1
my	1
father	1
took	1
over	1
the	1
Horsham	1
property,	1
he,	1
at	1
my	1
request,	1
made	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
attic,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
locked	1
up.	1
We	1
found	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
there,	1
although	1
its	1
contents	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed.	1
On	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
cover	1
was	1
a	1
paper	1
label,	1
with	1
the	1
initials	1
of	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.	1
repeated	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
'Letters,	1
memoranda,	1
receipts,	1
and	1
a	1
register'	1
written	1
beneath.	1
These,	1
we	1
presume,	1
indicated	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
destroyed	1
by	1
Colonel	1
Openshaw.	1
For	1
the	1
rest,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
much	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
attic	1
save	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
scattered	1
papers	1
and	1
note-books	1
bearing	1
upon	1
my	1
uncle's	1
life	1
in	1
America.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
time	1
and	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
duty	1
well	1
and	1
had	1
borne	1
the	1
repute	1
of	1
a	1
brave	1
soldier.	1
Others	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
date	1
during	1
the	1
reconstruction	1
of	1
the	1
Southern	1
states,	1
and	1
were	1
mostly	1
concerned	1
with	1
politics,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
taken	1
a	1
strong	1
part	1
in	1
opposing	1
the	1
carpet-bag	1
politicians	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
North.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
'84	1
when	1
my	1
father	1
came	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
and	1
all	1
went	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
possible	1
with	1
us	1
until	1
the	1
January	1
of	1
'85.	1
On	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
new	1
year	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
give	1
a	1
sharp	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table.	1
There	1
he	1
was,	1
sitting	1
with	1
a	1
newly	1
opened	1
envelope	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
five	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips	1
in	1
the	1
outstretched	1
palm	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
one.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
laughed	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
my	1
cock-and-bull	1
story	1
about	1
the	1
colonel,	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
very	1
scared	1
and	1
puzzled	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
himself.	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
does	1
this	1
mean,	1
John?'	1
he	1
stammered.	1
	1
"My	1
heart	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
lead.	1
'It	1
is	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
inside	1
the	1
envelope.	1
'So	1
it	1
is,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'Here	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
letters.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
written	1
above	1
them?'	1
	1
"'Put	1
the	1
papers	1
on	1
the	1
sundial,'	1
I	1
read,	1
peeping	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"'What	1
papers?	1
What	1
sundial?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'The	1
sundial	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
other,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'but	1
the	1
papers	1
must	1
be	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
destroyed.'	1
	1
"'Pooh!'	1
said	1
he,	1
gripping	1
hard	1
at	1
his	1
courage.	1
'We	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
civilised	1
land	1
here,	1
and	1
we	1
can't	1
have	1
tomfoolery	1
of	1
this	1
kind.	1
Where	1
does	1
the	1
thing	1
come	1
from?'	1
	1
"'From	1
Dundee,'	1
I	1
answered,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
postmark.	1
	1
"'Some	1
preposterous	1
practical	1
joke,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
sundials	1
and	1
papers?	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
such	1
nonsense.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
certainly	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
police,'	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
"'And	1
be	1
laughed	1
at	1
for	1
my	1
pains.	1
Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
let	1
me	1
do	1
so?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
forbid	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
have	1
a	1
fuss	1
made	1
about	1
such	1
nonsense.'	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
argue	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
obstinate	1
man.	1
I	1
went	1
about,	1
however,	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
forebodings.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
my	1
father	1
went	1
from	1
home	1
to	1
visit	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
Major	1
Freebody,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
forts	1
upon	1
Portsdown	1
Hill.	1
I	1
was	1
glad	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
farther	1
from	1
danger	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
from	1
home.	1
In	1
that,	1
however,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
error.	1
Upon	1
the	1
second	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
I	1
received	1
a	1
telegram	1
from	1
the	1
major,	1
imploring	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
once.	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
fallen	1
over	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
chalk-pits	1
which	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
was	1
lying	1
senseless,	1
with	1
a	1
shattered	1
skull.	1
I	1
hurried	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
recovered	1
his	1
consciousness.	1
He	1
had,	1
as	1
it	1
appears,	1
been	1
returning	1
from	1
Fareham	1
in	1
the	1
twilight,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
unknown	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
chalk-pit	1
unfenced,	1
the	1
jury	1
had	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
bringing	1
in	1
a	1
verdict	1
of	1
'death	1
from	1
accidental	1
causes.'	1
Carefully	1
as	1
I	1
examined	1
every	1
fact	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
death,	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1
which	1
could	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
murder.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
violence,	1
no	1
footmarks,	1
no	1
robbery,	1
no	1
record	1
of	1
strangers	1
having	1
been	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
roads.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
mind	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
well-nigh	1
certain	1
that	1
some	1
foul	1
plot	1
had	1
been	1
woven	1
round	1
him.	1
	1
"In	1
this	1
sinister	1
way	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
inheritance.	1
You	1
will	1
ask	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dispose	1
of	1
it?	1
I	1
answer,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
convinced	1
that	1
our	1
troubles	1
were	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
dependent	1
upon	1
an	1
incident	1
in	1
my	1
uncle's	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
pressing	1
in	1
one	1
house	1
as	1
in	1
another.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
in	1
January,	1
'85,	1
that	1
my	1
poor	1
father	1
met	1
his	1
end,	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
and	1
eight	1
months	1
have	1
elapsed	1
since	1
then.	1
During	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
happily	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
this	1
curse	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
ended	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
generation.	1
I	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
comfort	1
too	1
soon,	1
however;	1
yesterday	1
morning	1
the	1
blow	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
shape	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
father."	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
waistcoat	1
a	1
crumpled	1
envelope,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
shook	1
out	1
upon	1
it	1
five	1
little	1
dried	1
orange	1
pips.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
envelope,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"The	1
postmark	1
is	1
London--eastern	1
division.	1
Within	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
my	1
father's	1
last	1
message:	1
'K.	1
K.	1
K.';	1
and	1
then	1
'Put	1
the	1
papers	1
on	1
the	1
sundial.'"	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
done?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"Nothing?"	1
	1
"To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth"--he	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
his	1
thin,	1
white	1
hands--"I	1
have	1
felt	1
helpless.	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
poor	1
rabbits	1
when	1
the	1
snake	1
is	1
writhing	1
towards	1
it.	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
some	1
resistless,	1
inexorable	1
evil,	1
which	1
no	1
foresight	1
and	1
no	1
precautions	1
can	1
guard	1
against."	1
	1
"Tut!	1
tut!"	1
cried	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
must	1
act,	1
man,	1
or	1
you	1
are	1
lost.	1
Nothing	1
but	1
energy	1
can	1
save	1
you.	1
This	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
despair."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
police."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
listened	1
to	1
my	1
story	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
inspector	1
has	1
formed	1
the	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
letters	1
are	1
all	1
practical	1
jokes,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
my	1
relations	1
were	1
really	1
accidents,	1
as	1
the	1
jury	1
stated,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
warnings."	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
clenched	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
"Incredible	1
imbecility!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
"They	1
have,	1
however,	1
allowed	1
me	1
a	1
policeman,	1
who	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
me."	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
come	1
with	1
you	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"No.	1
His	1
orders	1
were	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
house."	1
	1
Again	1
Holmes	1
raved	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"and,	1
above	1
all,	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
once?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
to-day	1
that	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
Major	1
Prendergast	1
about	1
my	1
troubles	1
and	1
was	1
advised	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
really	1
two	1
days	1
since	1
you	1
had	1
the	1
letter.	1
We	1
should	1
have	1
acted	1
before	1
this.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
further	1
evidence,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
placed	1
before	1
us--no	1
suggestive	1
detail	1
which	1
might	1
help	1
us?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing,"	1
said	1
John	1
Openshaw.	1
He	1
rummaged	1
in	1
his	1
coat	1
pocket,	1
and,	1
drawing	1
out	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
discoloured,	1
blue-tinted	1
paper,	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
some	1
remembrance,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
my	1
uncle	1
burned	1
the	1
papers	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
small,	1
unburned	1
margins	1
which	1
lay	1
amid	1
the	1
ashes	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
particular	1
colour.	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
single	1
sheet	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
which	1
has,	1
perhaps,	1
fluttered	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
has	1
escaped	1
destruction.	1
Beyond	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
pips,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
helps	1
us	1
much.	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
page	1
from	1
some	1
private	1
diary.	1
The	1
writing	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
my	1
uncle's."	1
	1
Holmes	1
moved	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
we	1
both	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
which	1
showed	1
by	1
its	1
ragged	1
edge	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
indeed	1
been	1
torn	1
from	1
a	1
book.	1
It	1
was	1
headed,	1
"March,	1
1869,"	1
and	1
beneath	1
were	1
the	1
following	1
enigmatical	1
notices:	1
	1
"4th.	1
Hudson	1
came.	1
Same	1
old	1
platform.	1
	1
"7th.	1
Set	1
the	1
pips	1
on	1
McCauley,	1
Paramore,	1
and	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
John	1
Swain,	1
of	1
St.	1
Augustine.	1
	1
"9th.	1
McCauley	1
cleared.	1
	1
"10th.	1
John	1
Swain	1
cleared.	1
	1
"12th.	1
Visited	1
Paramore.	1
All	1
well."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
folding	1
up	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
returning	1
it	1
to	1
our	1
visitor.	1
"And	1
now	1
you	1
must	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
lose	1
another	1
instant.	1
We	1
cannot	1
spare	1
time	1
even	1
to	1
discuss	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me.	1
You	1
must	1
get	1
home	1
instantly	1
and	1
act."	1
	1
"What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?"	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
at	1
once.	1
You	1
must	1
put	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
paper	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
shown	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
brass	1
box	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
described.	1
You	1
must	1
also	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
note	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
papers	1
were	1
burned	1
by	1
your	1
uncle,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
remains.	1
You	1
must	1
assert	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
will	1
carry	1
conviction	1
with	1
them.	1
Having	1
done	1
this,	1
you	1
must	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
the	1
box	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sundial,	1
as	1
directed.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?"	1
	1
"Entirely."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
revenge,	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
at	1
present.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
gain	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
web	1
to	1
weave,	1
while	1
theirs	1
is	1
already	1
woven.	1
The	1
first	1
consideration	1
is	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
pressing	1
danger	1
which	1
threatens	1
you.	1
The	1
second	1
is	1
to	1
clear	1
up	1
the	1
mystery	1
and	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
guilty	1
parties."	1
	1
"I	1
thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
rising	1
and	1
pulling	1
on	1
his	1
overcoat.	1
"You	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
fresh	1
life	1
and	1
hope.	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
advise."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
lose	1
an	1
instant.	1
And,	1
above	1
all,	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile,	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
threatened	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
real	1
and	1
imminent	1
danger.	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
back?"	1
	1
"By	1
train	1
from	1
Waterloo."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
nine.	1
The	1
streets	1
will	1
be	1
crowded,	1
so	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
safety.	1
And	1
yet	1
you	1
cannot	1
guard	1
yourself	1
too	1
closely."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
armed."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
To-morrow	1
I	1
shall	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
your	1
case."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
Horsham,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
your	1
secret	1
lies	1
in	1
London.	1
It	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
seek	1
it."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
day,	1
or	1
in	1
two	1
days,	1
with	1
news	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
box	1
and	1
the	1
papers.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
your	1
advice	1
in	1
every	1
particular."	1
He	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
us	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
leave.	1
Outside	1
the	1
wind	1
still	1
screamed	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
splashed	1
and	1
pattered	1
against	1
the	1
windows.	1
This	1
strange,	1
wild	1
story	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
mad	1
elements--blown	1
in	1
upon	1
us	1
like	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
sea-weed	1
in	1
a	1
gale--and	1
now	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
reabsorbed	1
by	1
them	1
once	1
more.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
silence,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
forward	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
bent	1
upon	1
the	1
red	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
Then	1
he	1
lit	1
his	1
pipe,	1
and	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke-rings	1
as	1
they	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
at	1
last,	1
"that	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
cases	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
none	1
more	1
fantastic	1
than	1
this."	1
	1
"Save,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
Sign	1
of	1
Four."	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes.	1
Save,	1
perhaps,	1
that.	1
And	1
yet	1
this	1
John	1
Openshaw	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
walking	1
amid	1
even	1
greater	1
perils	1
than	1
did	1
the	1
Sholtos."	1
	1
"But	1
have	1
you,"	1
I	1
asked,	1
"formed	1
any	1
definite	1
conception	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
perils	1
are?"	1
	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
nature,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
are	1
they?	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.,	1
and	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
pursue	1
this	1
unhappy	1
family?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
placed	1
his	1
elbows	1
upon	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together.	1
"The	1
ideal	1
reasoner,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"would,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
shown	1
a	1
single	1
fact	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
bearings,	1
deduce	1
from	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
all	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
events	1
which	1
led	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
results	1
which	1
would	1
follow	1
from	1
it.	1
As	1
Cuvier	1
could	1
correctly	1
describe	1
a	1
whole	1
animal	1
by	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
bone,	1
so	1
the	1
observer	1
who	1
has	1
thoroughly	1
understood	1
one	1
link	1
in	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
incidents	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
accurately	1
state	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
ones,	1
both	1
before	1
and	1
after.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
grasped	1
the	1
results	1
which	1
the	1
reason	1
alone	1
can	1
attain	1
to.	1
Problems	1
may	1
be	1
solved	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
which	1
have	1
baffled	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sought	1
a	1
solution	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
their	1
senses.	1
To	1
carry	1
the	1
art,	1
however,	1
to	1
its	1
highest	1
pitch,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
reasoner	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
utilise	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
which	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
itself	1
implies,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
readily	1
see,	1
a	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
which,	1
even	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
free	1
education	1
and	1
encyclopaedias,	1
is	1
a	1
somewhat	1
rare	1
accomplishment.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
impossible,	1
however,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
possess	1
all	1
knowledge	1
which	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
to	1
do.	1
If	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
you	1
on	1
one	1
occasion,	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
friendship,	1
defined	1
my	1
limits	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
precise	1
fashion."	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
I	1
answered,	1
laughing.	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
document.	1
Philosophy,	1
astronomy,	1
and	1
politics	1
were	1
marked	1
at	1
zero,	1
I	1
remember.	1
Botany	1
variable,	1
geology	1
profound	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
mud-stains	1
from	1
any	1
region	1
within	1
fifty	1
miles	1
of	1
town,	1
chemistry	1
eccentric,	1
anatomy	1
unsystematic,	1
sensational	1
literature	1
and	1
crime	1
records	1
unique,	1
violin-player,	1
boxer,	1
swordsman,	1
lawyer,	1
and	1
self-poisoner	1
by	1
cocaine	1
and	1
tobacco.	1
Those,	1
I	1
think,	1
were	1
the	1
main	1
points	1
of	1
my	1
analysis."	1
	1
Holmes	1
grinned	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
item.	1
"Well,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
say	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
then,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
keep	1
his	1
little	1
brain-attic	1
stocked	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
use,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
he	1
can	1
put	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
lumber-room	1
of	1
his	1
library,	1
where	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
wants	1
it.	1
Now,	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
submitted	1
to	1
us	1
to-night,	1
we	1
need	1
certainly	1
to	1
muster	1
all	1
our	1
resources.	1
Kindly	1
hand	1
me	1
down	1
the	1
letter	1
K	1
of	1
the	1
'American	1
Encyclopaedia'	1
which	1
stands	1
upon	1
the	1
shelf	1
beside	1
you.	1
Thank	1
you.	1
Now	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
the	1
situation	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
we	1
may	1
start	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
presumption	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Openshaw	1
had	1
some	1
very	1
strong	1
reason	1
for	1
leaving	1
America.	1
Men	1
at	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
do	1
not	1
change	1
all	1
their	1
habits	1
and	1
exchange	1
willingly	1
the	1
charming	1
climate	1
of	1
Florida	1
for	1
the	1
lonely	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
English	1
provincial	1
town.	1
His	1
extreme	1
love	1
of	1
solitude	1
in	1
England	1
suggests	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
someone	1
or	1
something,	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
assume	1
as	1
a	1
working	1
hypothesis	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
fear	1
of	1
someone	1
or	1
something	1
which	1
drove	1
him	1
from	1
America.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
feared,	1
we	1
can	1
only	1
deduce	1
that	1
by	1
considering	1
the	1
formidable	1
letters	1
which	1
were	1
received	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
successors.	1
Did	1
you	1
remark	1
the	1
postmarks	1
of	1
those	1
letters?"	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
was	1
from	1
Pondicherry,	1
the	1
second	1
from	1
Dundee,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
from	1
London."	1
	1
"From	1
East	1
London.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
from	1
that?"	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
all	1
seaports.	1
That	1
the	1
writer	1
was	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
a	1
ship."	1
	1
"Excellent.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
a	1
clue.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
probability--the	1
strong	1
probability--is	1
that	1
the	1
writer	1
was	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
a	1
ship.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
another	1
point.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Pondicherry,	1
seven	1
weeks	1
elapsed	1
between	1
the	1
threat	1
and	1
its	1
fulfilment,	1
in	1
Dundee	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
some	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days.	1
Does	1
that	1
suggest	1
anything?"	1
	1
"A	1
greater	1
distance	1
to	1
travel."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
letter	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
greater	1
distance	1
to	1
come."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
point."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
presumption	1
that	1
the	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
or	1
men	1
are	1
is	1
a	1
sailing-ship.	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
always	1
send	1
their	1
singular	1
warning	1
or	1
token	1
before	1
them	1
when	1
starting	1
upon	1
their	1
mission.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
quickly	1
the	1
deed	1
followed	1
the	1
sign	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Dundee.	1
If	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Pondicherry	1
in	1
a	1
steamer	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
arrived	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
their	1
letter.	1
But,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
seven	1
weeks	1
elapsed.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
those	1
seven	1
weeks	1
represented	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
mail-boat	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
sailing	1
vessel	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
writer."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"More	1
than	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
probable.	1
And	1
now	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
deadly	1
urgency	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
case,	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
urged	1
young	1
Openshaw	1
to	1
caution.	1
The	1
blow	1
has	1
always	1
fallen	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
senders	1
to	1
travel	1
the	1
distance.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
comes	1
from	1
London,	1
and	1
therefore	1
we	1
cannot	1
count	1
upon	1
delay."	1
	1
"Good	1
God!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
mean,	1
this	1
relentless	1
persecution?"	1
	1
"The	1
papers	1
which	1
Openshaw	1
carried	1
are	1
obviously	1
of	1
vital	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
or	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
sailing-ship.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
A	1
single	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
carried	1
out	1
two	1
deaths	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
deceive	1
a	1
coroner's	1
jury.	1
There	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
several	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
men	1
of	1
resource	1
and	1
determination.	1
Their	1
papers	1
they	1
mean	1
to	1
have,	1
be	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
it	1
may.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
you	1
see	1
K.	1
K.	1
K.	1
ceases	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
initials	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
and	1
becomes	1
the	1
badge	1
of	1
a	1
society."	1
	1
"But	1
of	1
what	1
society?"	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never--"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
sinking	1
his	1
voice--"have	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
Ku	1
Klux	1
Klan?"	1
	1
"I	1
never	1
have."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
upon	1
his	1
knee.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
he	1
presently:	1
	1
"'Ku	1
Klux	1
Klan.	1
A	1
name	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
fanciful	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
produced	1
by	1
cocking	1
a	1
rifle.	1
This	1
terrible	1
secret	1
society	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
some	1
ex-Confederate	1
soldiers	1
in	1
the	1
Southern	1
states	1
after	1
the	1
Civil	1
War,	1
and	1
it	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
local	1
branches	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
notably	1
in	1
Tennessee,	1
Louisiana,	1
the	1
Carolinas,	1
Georgia,	1
and	1
Florida.	1
Its	1
power	1
was	1
used	1
for	1
political	1
purposes,	1
principally	1
for	1
the	1
terrorising	1
of	1
the	1
negro	1
voters	1
and	1
the	1
murdering	1
and	1
driving	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
opposed	1
to	1
its	1
views.	1
Its	1
outrages	1
were	1
usually	1
preceded	1
by	1
a	1
warning	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
marked	1
man	1
in	1
some	1
fantastic	1
but	1
generally	1
recognised	1
shape--a	1
sprig	1
of	1
oak-leaves	1
in	1
some	1
parts,	1
melon	1
seeds	1
or	1
orange	1
pips	1
in	1
others.	1
On	1
receiving	1
this	1
the	1
victim	1
might	1
either	1
openly	1
abjure	1
his	1
former	1
ways,	1
or	1
might	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
country.	1
If	1
he	1
braved	1
the	1
matter	1
out,	1
death	1
would	1
unfailingly	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
usually	1
in	1
some	1
strange	1
and	1
unforeseen	1
manner.	1
So	1
perfect	1
was	1
the	1
organisation	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
systematic	1
its	1
methods,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
case	1
upon	1
record	1
where	1
any	1
man	1
succeeded	1
in	1
braving	1
it	1
with	1
impunity,	1
or	1
in	1
which	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
outrages	1
were	1
traced	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
perpetrators.	1
For	1
some	1
years	1
the	1
organisation	1
flourished	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
government	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
better	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
in	1
the	1
South.	1
Eventually,	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1869,	1
the	1
movement	1
rather	1
suddenly	1
collapsed,	1
although	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
sporadic	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
since	1
that	1
date.'	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
observe,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laying	1
down	1
the	1
volume,	1
"that	1
the	1
sudden	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
was	1
coincident	1
with	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
Openshaw	1
from	1
America	1
with	1
their	1
papers.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
cause	1
and	1
effect.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
implacable	1
spirits	1
upon	1
their	1
track.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that	1
this	1
register	1
and	1
diary	1
may	1
implicate	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
South,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
many	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
sleep	1
easy	1
at	1
night	1
until	1
it	1
is	1
recovered."	1
	1
"Then	1
the	1
page	1
we	1
have	1
seen--"	1
	1
"Is	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
might	1
expect.	1
It	1
ran,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
'sent	1
the	1
pips	1
to	1
A,	1
B,	1
and	1
C'--that	1
is,	1
sent	1
the	1
society's	1
warning	1
to	1
them.	1
Then	1
there	1
are	1
successive	1
entries	1
that	1
A	1
and	1
B	1
cleared,	1
or	1
left	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
finally	1
that	1
C	1
was	1
visited,	1
with,	1
I	1
fear,	1
a	1
sinister	1
result	1
for	1
C.	1
Well,	1
I	1
think,	1
Doctor,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
let	1
some	1
light	1
into	1
this	1
dark	1
place,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
chance	1
young	1
Openshaw	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to-night,	1
so	1
hand	1
me	1
over	1
my	1
violin	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
forget	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
the	1
miserable	1
weather	1
and	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
miserable	1
ways	1
of	1
our	1
fellow-men."	1
	1
	1
It	1
had	1
cleared	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
with	1
a	1
subdued	1
brightness	1
through	1
the	1
dim	1
veil	1
which	1
hangs	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
city.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
already	1
at	1
breakfast	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"I	1
have,	1
I	1
foresee,	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
looking	1
into	1
this	1
case	1
of	1
young	1
Openshaw's."	1
	1
"What	1
steps	1
will	1
you	1
take?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"It	1
will	1
very	1
much	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
my	1
first	1
inquiries.	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Horsham,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
there	1
first?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
shall	1
commence	1
with	1
the	1
City.	1
Just	1
ring	1
the	1
bell	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
your	1
coffee."	1
	1
As	1
I	1
waited,	1
I	1
lifted	1
the	1
unopened	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
glanced	1
my	1
eye	1
over	1
it.	1
It	1
rested	1
upon	1
a	1
heading	1
which	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"you	1
are	1
too	1
late."	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
he,	1
laying	1
down	1
his	1
cup,	1
"I	1
feared	1
as	1
much.	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
done?"	1
He	1
spoke	1
calmly,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
deeply	1
moved.	1
	1
"My	1
eye	1
caught	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Openshaw,	1
and	1
the	1
heading	1
'Tragedy	1
Near	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge.'	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
account:	1
	1
"Between	1
nine	1
and	1
ten	1
last	1
night	1
Police-Constable	1
Cook,	1
of	1
the	1
H	1
Division,	1
on	1
duty	1
near	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge,	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
a	1
splash	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
night,	1
however,	1
was	1
extremely	1
dark	1
and	1
stormy,	1
so	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
several	1
passers-by,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
rescue.	1
The	1
alarm,	1
however,	1
was	1
given,	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
water-police,	1
the	1
body	1
was	1
eventually	1
recovered.	1
It	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman	1
whose	1
name,	1
as	1
it	1
appears	1
from	1
an	1
envelope	1
which	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
was	1
John	1
Openshaw,	1
and	1
whose	1
residence	1
is	1
near	1
Horsham.	1
It	1
is	1
conjectured	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
hurrying	1
down	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
last	1
train	1
from	1
Waterloo	1
Station,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
haste	1
and	1
the	1
extreme	1
darkness	1
he	1
missed	1
his	1
path	1
and	1
walked	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
landing-places	1
for	1
river	1
steamboats.	1
The	1
body	1
exhibited	1
no	1
traces	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
deceased	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
accident,	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
calling	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
authorities	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
riverside	1
landing-stages."	1
	1
We	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
minutes,	1
Holmes	1
more	1
depressed	1
and	1
shaken	1
than	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
hurts	1
my	1
pride,	1
Watson,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
petty	1
feeling,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
it	1
hurts	1
my	1
pride.	1
It	1
becomes	1
a	1
personal	1
matter	1
with	1
me	1
now,	1
and,	1
if	1
God	1
sends	1
me	1
health,	1
I	1
shall	1
set	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
this	1
gang.	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
help,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
send	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
death--!"	1
He	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
paced	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
uncontrollable	1
agitation,	1
with	1
a	1
flush	1
upon	1
his	1
sallow	1
cheeks	1
and	1
a	1
nervous	1
clasping	1
and	1
unclasping	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
hands.	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
be	1
cunning	1
devils,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
last.	1
"How	1
could	1
they	1
have	1
decoyed	1
him	1
down	1
there?	1
The	1
Embankment	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
direct	1
line	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
The	1
bridge,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
too	1
crowded,	1
even	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night,	1
for	1
their	1
purpose.	1
Well,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
who	1
will	1
win	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
run.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
out	1
now!"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
police?"	1
	1
"No;	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
police.	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
spun	1
the	1
web	1
they	1
may	1
take	1
the	1
flies,	1
but	1
not	1
before."	1
	1
All	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
my	1
professional	1
work,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
yet.	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
before	1
he	1
entered,	1
looking	1
pale	1
and	1
worn.	1
He	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
tearing	1
a	1
piece	1
from	1
the	1
loaf	1
he	1
devoured	1
it	1
voraciously,	1
washing	1
it	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
draught	1
of	1
water.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
hungry,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Starving.	1
It	1
had	1
escaped	1
my	1
memory.	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
since	1
breakfast."	1
	1
"Nothing?"	1
	1
"Not	1
a	1
bite.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
succeeded?"	1
	1
"Well."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
clue?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
Young	1
Openshaw	1
shall	1
not	1
long	1
remain	1
unavenged.	1
Why,	1
Watson,	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
their	1
own	1
devilish	1
trade-mark	1
upon	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
thought	1
of!"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
an	1
orange	1
from	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
and	1
tearing	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
he	1
squeezed	1
out	1
the	1
pips	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
Of	1
these	1
he	1
took	1
five	1
and	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
an	1
envelope.	1
On	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
flap	1
he	1
wrote	1
"S.	1
H.	1
for	1
J.	1
O."	1
Then	1
he	1
sealed	1
it	1
and	1
addressed	1
it	1
to	1
"Captain	1
James	1
Calhoun,	1
Barque	1
'Lone	1
Star,'	1
Savannah,	1
Georgia."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
await	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
enters	1
port,"	1
said	1
he,	1
chuckling.	1
"It	1
may	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night.	1
He	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
as	1
sure	1
a	1
precursor	1
of	1
his	1
fate	1
as	1
Openshaw	1
did	1
before	1
him."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Captain	1
Calhoun?"	1
	1
"The	1
leader	1
of	1
the	1
gang.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
others,	1
but	1
he	1
first."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
trace	1
it,	1
then?"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
all	1
covered	1
with	1
dates	1
and	1
names.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
day,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"over	1
Lloyd's	1
registers	1
and	1
files	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
papers,	1
following	1
the	1
future	1
career	1
of	1
every	1
vessel	1
which	1
touched	1
at	1
Pondicherry	1
in	1
January	1
and	1
February	1
in	1
'83.	1
There	1
were	1
thirty-six	1
ships	1
of	1
fair	1
tonnage	1
which	1
were	1
reported	1
there	1
during	1
those	1
months.	1
Of	1
these,	1
one,	1
the	1
'Lone	1
Star,'	1
instantly	1
attracted	1
my	1
attention,	1
since,	1
although	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
as	1
having	1
cleared	1
from	1
London,	1
the	1
name	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
states	1
of	1
the	1
Union."	1
	1
"Texas,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
which;	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
American	1
origin."	1
	1
"What	1
then?"	1
	1
"I	1
searched	1
the	1
Dundee	1
records,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
barque	1
'Lone	1
Star'	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
January,	1
'85,	1
my	1
suspicion	1
became	1
a	1
certainty.	1
I	1
then	1
inquired	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
vessels	1
which	1
lay	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
port	1
of	1
London."	1
	1
"Yes?"	1
	1
"The	1
'Lone	1
Star'	1
had	1
arrived	1
here	1
last	1
week.	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Albert	1
Dock	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
the	1
river	1
by	1
the	1
early	1
tide	1
this	1
morning,	1
homeward	1
bound	1
to	1
Savannah.	1
I	1
wired	1
to	1
Gravesend	1
and	1
learned	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
some	1
time	1
ago,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
easterly	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
past	1
the	1
Goodwins	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
Isle	1
of	1
Wight."	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
do,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
hand	1
upon	1
him.	1
He	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
mates,	1
are	1
as	1
I	1
learn,	1
the	1
only	1
native-born	1
Americans	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
The	1
others	1
are	1
Finns	1
and	1
Germans.	1
I	1
know,	1
also,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
three	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
ship	1
last	1
night.	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
stevedore	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
loading	1
their	1
cargo.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
their	1
sailing-ship	1
reaches	1
Savannah	1
the	1
mail-boat	1
will	1
have	1
carried	1
this	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
cable	1
will	1
have	1
informed	1
the	1
police	1
of	1
Savannah	1
that	1
these	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
badly	1
wanted	1
here	1
upon	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
murder."	1
	1
There	1
is	1
ever	1
a	1
flaw,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
laid	1
of	1
human	1
plans,	1
and	1
the	1
murderers	1
of	1
John	1
Openshaw	1
were	1
never	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
orange	1
pips	1
which	1
would	1
show	1
them	1
that	1
another,	1
as	1
cunning	1
and	1
as	1
resolute	1
as	1
themselves,	1
was	1
upon	1
their	1
track.	1
Very	1
long	1
and	1
very	1
severe	1
were	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
gales	1
that	1
year.	1
We	1
waited	1
long	1
for	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
"Lone	1
Star"	1
of	1
Savannah,	1
but	1
none	1
ever	1
reached	1
us.	1
We	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
hear	1
that	1
somewhere	1
far	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
a	1
shattered	1
stern-post	1
of	1
a	1
boat	1
was	1
seen	1
swinging	1
in	1
the	1
trough	1
of	1
a	1
wave,	1
with	1
the	1
letters	1
"L.	1
S."	1
carved	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
ever	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
"Lone	1
Star."	1
	1

	1
ADVENTURE	1
VI.	1
THE	1
MAN	1
WITH	1
THE	1
TWISTED	1
LIP	1
	1
Isa	1
Whitney,	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Elias	1
Whitney,	1
D.D.,	1
Principal	1
of	1
the	1
Theological	1
College	1
of	1
St.	1
George's,	1
was	1
much	1
addicted	1
to	1
opium.	1
The	1
habit	1
grew	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
from	1
some	1
foolish	1
freak	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
college;	1
for	1
having	1
read	1
De	1
Quincey's	1
description	1
of	1
his	1
dreams	1
and	1
sensations,	1
he	1
had	1
drenched	1
his	1
tobacco	1
with	1
laudanum	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
same	1
effects.	1
He	1
found,	1
as	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
have	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
practice	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
attain	1
than	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of,	1
and	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
the	1
drug,	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
mingled	1
horror	1
and	1
pity	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
relatives.	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
him	1
now,	1
with	1
yellow,	1
pasty	1
face,	1
drooping	1
lids,	1
and	1
pin-point	1
pupils,	1
all	1
huddled	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
the	1
wreck	1
and	1
ruin	1
of	1
a	1
noble	1
man.	1
	1
One	1
night--it	1
was	1
in	1
June,	1
'89--there	1
came	1
a	1
ring	1
to	1
my	1
bell,	1
about	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
gives	1
his	1
first	1
yawn	1
and	1
glances	1
at	1
the	1
clock.	1
I	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
chair,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
laid	1
her	1
needle-work	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
face	1
of	1
disappointment.	1
	1
"A	1
patient!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"You'll	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
out."	1
	1
I	1
groaned,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
newly	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
weary	1
day.	1
	1
We	1
heard	1
the	1
door	1
open,	1
a	1
few	1
hurried	1
words,	1
and	1
then	1
quick	1
steps	1
upon	1
the	1
linoleum.	1
Our	1
own	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
a	1
lady,	1
clad	1
in	1
some	1
dark-coloured	1
stuff,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
veil,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
calling	1
so	1
late,"	1
she	1
began,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
losing	1
her	1
self-control,	1
she	1
ran	1
forward,	1
threw	1
her	1
arms	1
about	1
my	1
wife's	1
neck,	1
and	1
sobbed	1
upon	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
"Oh,	1
I'm	1
in	1
such	1
trouble!"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"I	1
do	1
so	1
want	1
a	1
little	1
help."	1
	1
"Why,"	1
said	1
my	1
wife,	1
pulling	1
up	1
her	1
veil,	1
"it	1
is	1
Kate	1
Whitney.	1
How	1
you	1
startled	1
me,	1
Kate!	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
an	1
idea	1
who	1
you	1
were	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
in."	1
	1
"I	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
so	1
I	1
came	1
straight	1
to	1
you."	1
That	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
way.	1
Folk	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
grief	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
like	1
birds	1
to	1
a	1
light-house.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
very	1
sweet	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come.	1
Now,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
wine	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
sit	1
here	1
comfortably	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
Or	1
should	1
you	1
rather	1
that	1
I	1
sent	1
James	1
off	1
to	1
bed?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
no!	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
doctor's	1
advice	1
and	1
help,	1
too.	1
It's	1
about	1
Isa.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
home	1
for	1
two	1
days.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
frightened	1
about	1
him!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
trouble,	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
doctor,	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
as	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
school	1
companion.	1
We	1
soothed	1
and	1
comforted	1
her	1
by	1
such	1
words	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
find.	1
Did	1
she	1
know	1
where	1
her	1
husband	1
was?	1
Was	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
her?	1
	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
it	1
was.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
surest	1
information	1
that	1
of	1
late	1
he	1
had,	1
when	1
the	1
fit	1
was	1
on	1
him,	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
an	1
opium	1
den	1
in	1
the	1
farthest	1
east	1
of	1
the	1
City.	1
Hitherto	1
his	1
orgies	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
confined	1
to	1
one	1
day,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
back,	1
twitching	1
and	1
shattered,	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
spell	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
him	1
eight-and-forty	1
hours,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
there,	1
doubtless	1
among	1
the	1
dregs	1
of	1
the	1
docks,	1
breathing	1
in	1
the	1
poison	1
or	1
sleeping	1
off	1
the	1
effects.	1
There	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
it,	1
at	1
the	1
Bar	1
of	1
Gold,	1
in	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane.	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
to	1
do?	1
How	1
could	1
she,	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
timid	1
woman,	1
make	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
pluck	1
her	1
husband	1
out	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
ruffians	1
who	1
surrounded	1
him?	1
	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Might	1
I	1
not	1
escort	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
place?	1
And	1
then,	1
as	1
a	1
second	1
thought,	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
come	1
at	1
all?	1
I	1
was	1
Isa	1
Whitney's	1
medical	1
adviser,	1
and	1
as	1
such	1
I	1
had	1
influence	1
over	1
him.	1
I	1
could	1
manage	1
it	1
better	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
alone.	1
I	1
promised	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
him	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
within	1
two	1
hours	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
indeed	1
at	1
the	1
address	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
me.	1
And	1
so	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
my	1
armchair	1
and	1
cheery	1
sitting-room	1
behind	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
speeding	1
eastward	1
in	1
a	1
hansom	1
on	1
a	1
strange	1
errand,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
though	1
the	1
future	1
only	1
could	1
show	1
how	1
strange	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
my	1
adventure.	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane	1
is	1
a	1
vile	1
alley	1
lurking	1
behind	1
the	1
high	1
wharves	1
which	1
line	1
the	1
north	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
the	1
east	1
of	1
London	1
Bridge.	1
Between	1
a	1
slop-shop	1
and	1
a	1
gin-shop,	1
approached	1
by	1
a	1
steep	1
flight	1
of	1
steps	1
leading	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
black	1
gap	1
like	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
cave,	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
search.	1
Ordering	1
my	1
cab	1
to	1
wait,	1
I	1
passed	1
down	1
the	1
steps,	1
worn	1
hollow	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
by	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
tread	1
of	1
drunken	1
feet;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
flickering	1
oil-lamp	1
above	1
the	1
door	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
latch	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
way	1
into	1
a	1
long,	1
low	1
room,	1
thick	1
and	1
heavy	1
with	1
the	1
brown	1
opium	1
smoke,	1
and	1
terraced	1
with	1
wooden	1
berths,	1
like	1
the	1
forecastle	1
of	1
an	1
emigrant	1
ship.	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
gloom	1
one	1
could	1
dimly	1
catch	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
bodies	1
lying	1
in	1
strange	1
fantastic	1
poses,	1
bowed	1
shoulders,	1
bent	1
knees,	1
heads	1
thrown	1
back,	1
and	1
chins	1
pointing	1
upward,	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
dark,	1
lack-lustre	1
eye	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
black	1
shadows	1
there	1
glimmered	1
little	1
red	1
circles	1
of	1
light,	1
now	1
bright,	1
now	1
faint,	1
as	1
the	1
burning	1
poison	1
waxed	1
or	1
waned	1
in	1
the	1
bowls	1
of	1
the	1
metal	1
pipes.	1
The	1
most	1
lay	1
silent,	1
but	1
some	1
muttered	1
to	1
themselves,	1
and	1
others	1
talked	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
strange,	1
low,	1
monotonous	1
voice,	1
their	1
conversation	1
coming	1
in	1
gushes,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly	1
tailing	1
off	1
into	1
silence,	1
each	1
mumbling	1
out	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts	1
and	1
paying	1
little	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
At	1
the	1
farther	1
end	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
brazier	1
of	1
burning	1
charcoal,	1
beside	1
which	1
on	1
a	1
three-legged	1
wooden	1
stool	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
tall,	1
thin	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
his	1
jaw	1
resting	1
upon	1
his	1
two	1
fists,	1
and	1
his	1
elbows	1
upon	1
his	1
knees,	1
staring	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
As	1
I	1
entered,	1
a	1
sallow	1
Malay	1
attendant	1
had	1
hurried	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
pipe	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
beckoning	1
me	1
to	1
an	1
empty	1
berth.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
stay,"	1
said	1
I.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
here,	1
Mr.	1
Isa	1
Whitney,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
movement	1
and	1
an	1
exclamation	1
from	1
my	1
right,	1
and	1
peering	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
I	1
saw	1
Whitney,	1
pale,	1
haggard,	1
and	1
unkempt,	1
staring	1
out	1
at	1
me.	1
	1
"My	1
God!	1
It's	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
state	1
of	1
reaction,	1
with	1
every	1
nerve	1
in	1
a	1
twitter.	1
"I	1
say,	1
Watson,	1
what	1
o'clock	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Nearly	1
eleven."	1
	1
"Of	1
what	1
day?"	1
	1
"Of	1
Friday,	1
June	1
19th."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
Wednesday.	1
It	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
What	1
d'you	1
want	1
to	1
frighten	1
a	1
chap	1
for?"	1
He	1
sank	1
his	1
face	1
onto	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
sob	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
treble	1
key.	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
Friday,	1
man.	1
Your	1
wife	1
has	1
been	1
waiting	1
this	1
two	1
days	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself!"	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
am.	1
But	1
you've	1
got	1
mixed,	1
Watson,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
here	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
three	1
pipes,	1
four	1
pipes--I	1
forget	1
how	1
many.	1
But	1
I'll	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
frighten	1
Kate--poor	1
little	1
Kate.	1
Give	1
me	1
your	1
hand!	1
Have	1
you	1
a	1
cab?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
waiting."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
it.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
owe	1
something.	1
Find	1
what	1
I	1
owe,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
off	1
colour.	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
for	1
myself."	1
	1
I	1
walked	1
down	1
the	1
narrow	1
passage	1
between	1
the	1
double	1
row	1
of	1
sleepers,	1
holding	1
my	1
breath	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
the	1
vile,	1
stupefying	1
fumes	1
of	1
the	1
drug,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
manager.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
the	1
tall	1
man	1
who	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
brazier	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
sudden	1
pluck	1
at	1
my	1
skirt,	1
and	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
whispered,	1
"Walk	1
past	1
me,	1
and	1
then	1
look	1
back	1
at	1
me."	1
The	1
words	1
fell	1
quite	1
distinctly	1
upon	1
my	1
ear.	1
I	1
glanced	1
down.	1
They	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
at	1
my	1
side,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
sat	1
now	1
as	1
absorbed	1
as	1
ever,	1
very	1
thin,	1
very	1
wrinkled,	1
bent	1
with	1
age,	1
an	1
opium	1
pipe	1
dangling	1
down	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
knees,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
dropped	1
in	1
sheer	1
lassitude	1
from	1
his	1
fingers.	1
I	1
took	1
two	1
steps	1
forward	1
and	1
looked	1
back.	1
It	1
took	1
all	1
my	1
self-control	1
to	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
breaking	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
astonishment.	1
He	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
back	1
so	1
that	1
none	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
but	1
I.	1
His	1
form	1
had	1
filled	1
out,	1
his	1
wrinkles	1
were	1
gone,	1
the	1
dull	1
eyes	1
had	1
regained	1
their	1
fire,	1
and	1
there,	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
grinning	1
at	1
my	1
surprise,	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
slight	1
motion	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
approach	1
him,	1
and	1
instantly,	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
half	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
once	1
more,	1
subsided	1
into	1
a	1
doddering,	1
loose-lipped	1
senility.	1
	1
"Holmes!"	1
I	1
whispered,	1
"what	1
on	1
earth	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
in	1
this	1
den?"	1
	1
"As	1
low	1
as	1
you	1
can,"	1
he	1
answered;	1
"I	1
have	1
excellent	1
ears.	1
If	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
kindness	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
that	1
sottish	1
friend	1
of	1
yours	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
talk	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
cab	1
outside."	1
	1
"Then	1
pray	1
send	1
him	1
home	1
in	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
safely	1
trust	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
limp	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
any	1
mischief.	1
I	1
should	1
recommend	1
you	1
also	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
note	1
by	1
the	1
cabman	1
to	1
your	1
wife	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
thrown	1
in	1
your	1
lot	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
wait	1
outside,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
five	1
minutes."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
refuse	1
any	1
of	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
requests,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
definite,	1
and	1
put	1
forward	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
quiet	1
air	1
of	1
mastery.	1
I	1
felt,	1
however,	1
that	1
when	1
Whitney	1
was	1
once	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
my	1
mission	1
was	1
practically	1
accomplished;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
anything	1
better	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
associated	1
with	1
my	1
friend	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
singular	1
adventures	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
normal	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
existence.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
I	1
had	1
written	1
my	1
note,	1
paid	1
Whitney's	1
bill,	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
seen	1
him	1
driven	1
through	1
the	1
darkness.	1
In	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
a	1
decrepit	1
figure	1
had	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
walking	1
down	1
the	1
street	1
with	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
For	1
two	1
streets	1
he	1
shuffled	1
along	1
with	1
a	1
bent	1
back	1
and	1
an	1
uncertain	1
foot.	1
Then,	1
glancing	1
quickly	1
round,	1
he	1
straightened	1
himself	1
out	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter.	1
	1
"I	1
suppose,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
added	1
opium-smoking	1
to	1
cocaine	1
injections,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
little	1
weaknesses	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
favoured	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
medical	1
views."	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
certainly	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
there."	1
	1
"But	1
not	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
came	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
friend."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
to	1
find	1
an	1
enemy."	1
	1
"An	1
enemy?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
natural	1
enemies,	1
or,	1
shall	1
I	1
say,	1
my	1
natural	1
prey.	1
Briefly,	1
Watson,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
clue	1
in	1
the	1
incoherent	1
ramblings	1
of	1
these	1
sots,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
before	1
now.	1
Had	1
I	1
been	1
recognised	1
in	1
that	1
den	1
my	1
life	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
worth	1
an	1
hour's	1
purchase;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
it	1
before	1
now	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
purposes,	1
and	1
the	1
rascally	1
Lascar	1
who	1
runs	1
it	1
has	1
sworn	1
to	1
have	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
me.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
trap-door	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
that	1
building,	1
near	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Paul's	1
Wharf,	1
which	1
could	1
tell	1
some	1
strange	1
tales	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
passed	1
through	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
moonless	1
nights."	1
	1
"What!	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
bodies?"	1
	1
"Ay,	1
bodies,	1
Watson.	1
We	1
should	1
be	1
rich	1
men	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
1000	1
pounds	1
for	1
every	1
poor	1
devil	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
death	1
in	1
that	1
den.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
vilest	1
murder-trap	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
riverside,	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
has	1
entered	1
it	1
never	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
more.	1
But	1
our	1
trap	1
should	1
be	1
here."	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
two	1
forefingers	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
whistled	1
shrilly--a	1
signal	1
which	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
whistle	1
from	1
the	1
distance,	1
followed	1
shortly	1
by	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
clink	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs.	1
	1
"Now,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
as	1
a	1
tall	1
dog-cart	1
dashed	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
throwing	1
out	1
two	1
golden	1
tunnels	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
from	1
its	1
side	1
lanterns.	1
"You'll	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
use."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
trusty	1
comrade	1
is	1
always	1
of	1
use;	1
and	1
a	1
chronicler	1
still	1
more	1
so.	1
My	1
room	1
at	1
The	1
Cedars	1
is	1
a	1
double-bedded	1
one."	1
	1
"The	1
Cedars?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
that	1
is	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
house.	1
I	1
am	1
staying	1
there	1
while	1
I	1
conduct	1
the	1
inquiry."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
it,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Near	1
Lee,	1
in	1
Kent.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
seven-mile	1
drive	1
before	1
us."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"Of	1
course	1
you	1
are.	1
You'll	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
presently.	1
Jump	1
up	1
here.	1
All	1
right,	1
John;	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
need	1
you.	1
Here's	1
half	1
a	1
crown.	1
Look	1
out	1
for	1
me	1
to-morrow,	1
about	1
eleven.	1
Give	1
her	1
her	1
head.	1
So	1
long,	1
then!"	1
	1
He	1
flicked	1
the	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
whip,	1
and	1
we	1
dashed	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
endless	1
succession	1
of	1
sombre	1
and	1
deserted	1
streets,	1
which	1
widened	1
gradually,	1
until	1
we	1
were	1
flying	1
across	1
a	1
broad	1
balustraded	1
bridge,	1
with	1
the	1
murky	1
river	1
flowing	1
sluggishly	1
beneath	1
us.	1
Beyond	1
lay	1
another	1
dull	1
wilderness	1
of	1
bricks	1
and	1
mortar,	1
its	1
silence	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
heavy,	1
regular	1
footfall	1
of	1
the	1
policeman,	1
or	1
the	1
songs	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
some	1
belated	1
party	1
of	1
revellers.	1
A	1
dull	1
wrack	1
was	1
drifting	1
slowly	1
across	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
a	1
star	1
or	1
two	1
twinkled	1
dimly	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
through	1
the	1
rifts	1
of	1
the	1
clouds.	1
Holmes	1
drove	1
in	1
silence,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
lost	1
in	1
thought,	1
while	1
I	1
sat	1
beside	1
him,	1
curious	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
quest	1
might	1
be	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
tax	1
his	1
powers	1
so	1
sorely,	1
and	1
yet	1
afraid	1
to	1
break	1
in	1
upon	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
We	1
had	1
driven	1
several	1
miles,	1
and	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
fringe	1
of	1
the	1
belt	1
of	1
suburban	1
villas,	1
when	1
he	1
shook	1
himself,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1
pipe	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
acting	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
grand	1
gift	1
of	1
silence,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
makes	1
you	1
quite	1
invaluable	1
as	1
a	1
companion.	1
'Pon	1
my	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
to	1
talk	1
to,	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
thoughts	1
are	1
not	1
over-pleasant.	1
I	1
was	1
wondering	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
dear	1
little	1
woman	1
to-night	1
when	1
she	1
meets	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
door."	1
	1
"You	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
just	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
Lee.	1
It	1
seems	1
absurdly	1
simple,	1
and	1
yet,	1
somehow	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
nothing	1
to	1
go	1
upon.	1
There's	1
plenty	1
of	1
thread,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
get	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
hand.	1
Now,	1
I'll	1
state	1
the	1
case	1
clearly	1
and	1
concisely	1
to	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
and	1
maybe	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
a	1
spark	1
where	1
all	1
is	1
dark	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Proceed,	1
then."	1
	1
"Some	1
years	1
ago--to	1
be	1
definite,	1
in	1
May,	1
1884--there	1
came	1
to	1
Lee	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
by	1
name,	1
who	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
money.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
villa,	1
laid	1
out	1
the	1
grounds	1
very	1
nicely,	1
and	1
lived	1
generally	1
in	1
good	1
style.	1
By	1
degrees	1
he	1
made	1
friends	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
in	1
1887	1
he	1
married	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
local	1
brewer,	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
has	1
two	1
children.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
occupation,	1
but	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
several	1
companies	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
town	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
returning	1
by	1
the	1
5:14	1
from	1
Cannon	1
Street	1
every	1
night.	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
is	1
now	1
thirty-seven	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
temperate	1
habits,	1
a	1
good	1
husband,	1
a	1
very	1
affectionate	1
father,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
popular	1
with	1
all	1
who	1
know	1
him.	1
I	1
may	1
add	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
debts	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
ascertain,	1
amount	1
to	1
88	1
pounds	1
10s.,	1
while	1
he	1
has	1
220	1
pounds	1
standing	1
to	1
his	1
credit	1
in	1
the	1
Capital	1
and	1
Counties	1
Bank.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
reason,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
money	1
troubles	1
have	1
been	1
weighing	1
upon	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Last	1
Monday	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
went	1
into	1
town	1
rather	1
earlier	1
than	1
usual,	1
remarking	1
before	1
he	1
started	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
two	1
important	1
commissions	1
to	1
perform,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
little	1
boy	1
home	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
bricks.	1
Now,	1
by	1
the	1
merest	1
chance,	1
his	1
wife	1
received	1
a	1
telegram	1
upon	1
this	1
same	1
Monday,	1
very	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
departure,	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
parcel	1
of	1
considerable	1
value	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
expecting	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
Aberdeen	1
Shipping	1
Company.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
well	1
up	1
in	1
your	1
London,	1
you	1
will	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
is	1
in	1
Fresno	1
Street,	1
which	1
branches	1
out	1
of	1
Upper	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
where	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
to-night.	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
her	1
lunch,	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
City,	1
did	1
some	1
shopping,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
company's	1
office,	1
got	1
her	1
packet,	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
at	1
exactly	1
4:35	1
walking	1
through	1
Swandam	1
Lane	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
Have	1
you	1
followed	1
me	1
so	1
far?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
clear."	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
remember,	1
Monday	1
was	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
hot	1
day,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
walked	1
slowly,	1
glancing	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
cab,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
found	1
herself.	1
While	1
she	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
down	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
an	1
ejaculation	1
or	1
cry,	1
and	1
was	1
struck	1
cold	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
husband	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her,	1
beckoning	1
to	1
her	1
from	1
a	1
second-floor	1
window.	1
The	1
window	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
she	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
she	1
describes	1
as	1
being	1
terribly	1
agitated.	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hands	1
frantically	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
vanished	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
plucked	1
back	1
by	1
some	1
irresistible	1
force	1
from	1
behind.	1
One	1
singular	1
point	1
which	1
struck	1
her	1
quick	1
feminine	1
eye	1
was	1
that	1
although	1
he	1
wore	1
some	1
dark	1
coat,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
started	1
to	1
town	1
in,	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
neither	1
collar	1
nor	1
necktie.	1
	1
"Convinced	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
amiss	1
with	1
him,	1
she	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
steps--for	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
opium	1
den	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
to-night--and	1
running	1
through	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
she	1
attempted	1
to	1
ascend	1
the	1
stairs	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
floor.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
however,	1
she	1
met	1
this	1
Lascar	1
scoundrel	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
who	1
thrust	1
her	1
back	1
and,	1
aided	1
by	1
a	1
Dane,	1
who	1
acts	1
as	1
assistant	1
there,	1
pushed	1
her	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
Filled	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
maddening	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears,	1
she	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
lane	1
and,	1
by	1
rare	1
good-fortune,	1
met	1
in	1
Fresno	1
Street	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
constables	1
with	1
an	1
inspector,	1
all	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
their	1
beat.	1
The	1
inspector	1
and	1
two	1
men	1
accompanied	1
her	1
back,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
continued	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
proprietor,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
Mr.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
last	1
been	1
seen.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him	1
there.	1
In	1
fact,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
floor	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
save	1
a	1
crippled	1
wretch	1
of	1
hideous	1
aspect,	1
who,	1
it	1
seems,	1
made	1
his	1
home	1
there.	1
Both	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
Lascar	1
stoutly	1
swore	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
during	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
So	1
determined	1
was	1
their	1
denial	1
that	1
the	1
inspector	1
was	1
staggered,	1
and	1
had	1
almost	1
come	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
been	1
deluded	1
when,	1
with	1
a	1
cry,	1
she	1
sprang	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
deal	1
box	1
which	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
tore	1
the	1
lid	1
from	1
it.	1
Out	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
cascade	1
of	1
children's	1
bricks.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
toy	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
bring	1
home.	1
	1
"This	1
discovery,	1
and	1
the	1
evident	1
confusion	1
which	1
the	1
cripple	1
showed,	1
made	1
the	1
inspector	1
realise	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
serious.	1
The	1
rooms	1
were	1
carefully	1
examined,	1
and	1
results	1
all	1
pointed	1
to	1
an	1
abominable	1
crime.	1
The	1
front	1
room	1
was	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
as	1
a	1
sitting-room	1
and	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
bedroom,	1
which	1
looked	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wharves.	1
Between	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
the	1
bedroom	1
window	1
is	1
a	1
narrow	1
strip,	1
which	1
is	1
dry	1
at	1
low	1
tide	1
but	1
is	1
covered	1
at	1
high	1
tide	1
with	1
at	1
least	1
four	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
feet	1
of	1
water.	1
The	1
bedroom	1
window	1
was	1
a	1
broad	1
one	1
and	1
opened	1
from	1
below.	1
On	1
examination	1
traces	1
of	1
blood	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
windowsill,	1
and	1
several	1
scattered	1
drops	1
were	1
visible	1
upon	1
the	1
wooden	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Thrust	1
away	1
behind	1
a	1
curtain	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
room	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
clothes	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
his	1
coat.	1
His	1
boots,	1
his	1
socks,	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
his	1
watch--all	1
were	1
there.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
violence	1
upon	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
garments,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
other	1
traces	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
he	1
must	1
apparently	1
have	1
gone	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
exit	1
could	1
be	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
ominous	1
bloodstains	1
upon	1
the	1
sill	1
gave	1
little	1
promise	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
save	1
himself	1
by	1
swimming,	1
for	1
the	1
tide	1
was	1
at	1
its	1
very	1
highest	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
villains	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
immediately	1
implicated	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
Lascar	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
vilest	1
antecedents,	1
but	1
as,	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
story,	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stair	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
seconds	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
appearance	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
accessory	1
to	1
the	1
crime.	1
His	1
defence	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
absolute	1
ignorance,	1
and	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Hugh	1
Boone,	1
his	1
lodger,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
account	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
gentleman's	1
clothes.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
Lascar	1
manager.	1
Now	1
for	1
the	1
sinister	1
cripple	1
who	1
lives	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
last	1
human	1
being	1
whose	1
eyes	1
rested	1
upon	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Hugh	1
Boone,	1
and	1
his	1
hideous	1
face	1
is	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
goes	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
City.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
professional	1
beggar,	1
though	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
police	1
regulations	1
he	1
pretends	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
trade	1
in	1
wax	1
vestas.	1
Some	1
little	1
distance	1
down	1
Threadneedle	1
Street,	1
upon	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side,	1
there	1
is,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
remarked,	1
a	1
small	1
angle	1
in	1
the	1
wall.	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
creature	1
takes	1
his	1
daily	1
seat,	1
cross-legged	1
with	1
his	1
tiny	1
stock	1
of	1
matches	1
on	1
his	1
lap,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
piteous	1
spectacle	1
a	1
small	1
rain	1
of	1
charity	1
descends	1
into	1
the	1
greasy	1
leather	1
cap	1
which	1
lies	1
upon	1
the	1
pavement	1
beside	1
him.	1
I	1
have	1
watched	1
the	1
fellow	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
before	1
ever	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
professional	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
harvest	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
reaped	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
His	1
appearance,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
so	1
remarkable	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
pass	1
him	1
without	1
observing	1
him.	1
A	1
shock	1
of	1
orange	1
hair,	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
disfigured	1
by	1
a	1
horrible	1
scar,	1
which,	1
by	1
its	1
contraction,	1
has	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
outer	1
edge	1
of	1
his	1
upper	1
lip,	1
a	1
bulldog	1
chin,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
very	1
penetrating	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
which	1
present	1
a	1
singular	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
his	1
hair,	1
all	1
mark	1
him	1
out	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
common	1
crowd	1
of	1
mendicants	1
and	1
so,	1
too,	1
does	1
his	1
wit,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
ever	1
ready	1
with	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
any	1
piece	1
of	1
chaff	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
thrown	1
at	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
passers-by.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
we	1
now	1
learn	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
lodger	1
at	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
gentleman	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
quest."	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
cripple!"	1
said	1
I.	1
"What	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
done	1
single-handed	1
against	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
of	1
life?"	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
cripple	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
walks	1
with	1
a	1
limp;	1
but	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
powerful	1
and	1
well-nurtured	1
man.	1
Surely	1
your	1
medical	1
experience	1
would	1
tell	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
one	1
limb	1
is	1
often	1
compensated	1
for	1
by	1
exceptional	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
others."	1
	1
"Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
narrative."	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
had	1
fainted	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
upon	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
escorted	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
cab	1
by	1
the	1
police,	1
as	1
her	1
presence	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
help	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
investigations.	1
Inspector	1
Barton,	1
who	1
had	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
premises,	1
but	1
without	1
finding	1
anything	1
which	1
threw	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
matter.	1
One	1
mistake	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
not	1
arresting	1
Boone	1
instantly,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
allowed	1
some	1
few	1
minutes	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
communicated	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Lascar,	1
but	1
this	1
fault	1
was	1
soon	1
remedied,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
and	1
searched,	1
without	1
anything	1
being	1
found	1
which	1
could	1
incriminate	1
him.	1
There	1
were,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
some	1
blood-stains	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
shirt-sleeve,	1
but	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
ring-finger,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
near	1
the	1
nail,	1
and	1
explained	1
that	1
the	1
bleeding	1
came	1
from	1
there,	1
adding	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
not	1
long	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stains	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
observed	1
there	1
came	1
doubtless	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
source.	1
He	1
denied	1
strenuously	1
having	1
ever	1
seen	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
clothes	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
As	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
assertion	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
actually	1
seen	1
her	1
husband	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
either	1
mad	1
or	1
dreaming.	1
He	1
was	1
removed,	1
loudly	1
protesting,	1
to	1
the	1
police-station,	1
while	1
the	1
inspector	1
remained	1
upon	1
the	1
premises	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
ebbing	1
tide	1
might	1
afford	1
some	1
fresh	1
clue.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
did,	1
though	1
they	1
hardly	1
found	1
upon	1
the	1
mud-bank	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
feared	1
to	1
find.	1
It	1
was	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair's	1
coat,	1
and	1
not	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
which	1
lay	1
uncovered	1
as	1
the	1
tide	1
receded.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
pockets?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
would	1
guess.	1
Every	1
pocket	1
stuffed	1
with	1
pennies	1
and	1
half-pennies--421	1
pennies	1
and	1
270	1
half-pennies.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
swept	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
tide.	1
But	1
a	1
human	1
body	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
matter.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
fierce	1
eddy	1
between	1
the	1
wharf	1
and	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
seemed	1
likely	1
enough	1
that	1
the	1
weighted	1
coat	1
had	1
remained	1
when	1
the	1
stripped	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
sucked	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
river."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
clothes	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Would	1
the	1
body	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
coat	1
alone?"	1
	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
but	1
the	1
facts	1
might	1
be	1
met	1
speciously	1
enough.	1
Suppose	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Boone	1
had	1
thrust	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
through	1
the	1
window,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
human	1
eye	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
deed.	1
What	1
would	1
he	1
do	1
then?	1
It	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
instantly	1
strike	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
tell-tale	1
garments.	1
He	1
would	1
seize	1
the	1
coat,	1
then,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
throwing	1
it	1
out,	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
swim	1
and	1
not	1
sink.	1
He	1
has	1
little	1
time,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
heard	1
the	1
scuffle	1
downstairs	1
when	1
the	1
wife	1
tried	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
way	1
up,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
has	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
Lascar	1
confederate	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
hurrying	1
up	1
the	1
street.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
be	1
lost.	1
He	1
rushes	1
to	1
some	1
secret	1
hoard,	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
accumulated	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
his	1
beggary,	1
and	1
he	1
stuffs	1
all	1
the	1
coins	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
can	1
lay	1
his	1
hands	1
into	1
the	1
pockets	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
coat's	1
sinking.	1
He	1
throws	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
garments	1
had	1
not	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
rush	1
of	1
steps	1
below,	1
and	1
only	1
just	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
close	1
the	1
window	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
appeared."	1
	1
"It	1
certainly	1
sounds	1
feasible."	1
	1
"Well,	1
we	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
working	1
hypothesis	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
better.	1
Boone,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
was	1
arrested	1
and	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
station,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
ever	1
before	1
been	1
anything	1
against	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
for	1
years	1
been	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
professional	1
beggar,	1
but	1
his	1
life	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
quiet	1
and	1
innocent	1
one.	1
There	1
the	1
matter	1
stands	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
solved--what	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair	1
was	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
opium	1
den,	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
there,	1
where	1
is	1
he	1
now,	1
and	1
what	1
Hugh	1
Boone	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
his	1
disappearance--are	1
all	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
a	1
solution	1
as	1
ever.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
any	1
case	1
within	1
my	1
experience	1
which	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
so	1
simple	1
and	1
yet	1
which	1
presented	1
such	1
difficulties."	1
	1
While	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
detailing	1
this	1
singular	1
series	1
of	1
events,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
whirling	1
through	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
town	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
straggling	1
houses	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
behind,	1
and	1
we	1
rattled	1
along	1
with	1
a	1
country	1
hedge	1
upon	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
us.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
finished,	1
however,	1
we	1
drove	1
through	1
two	1
scattered	1
villages,	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
lights	1
still	1
glimmered	1
in	1
the	1
windows.	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
Lee,"	1
said	1
my	1
companion.	1
"We	1
have	1
touched	1
on	1
three	1
English	1
counties	1
in	1
our	1
short	1
drive,	1
starting	1
in	1
Middlesex,	1
passing	1
over	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
Surrey,	1
and	1
ending	1
in	1
Kent.	1
See	1
that	1
light	1
among	1
the	1
trees?	1
That	1
is	1
The	1
Cedars,	1
and	1
beside	1
that	1
lamp	1
sits	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
anxious	1
ears	1
have	1
already,	1
I	1
have	1
little	1
doubt,	1
caught	1
the	1
clink	1
of	1
our	1
horse's	1
feet."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
conducting	1
the	1
case	1
from	1
Baker	1
Street?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Because	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
inquiries	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
out	1
here.	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair	1
has	1
most	1
kindly	1
put	1
two	1
rooms	1
at	1
my	1
disposal,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
welcome	1
for	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague.	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
Watson,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
news	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
Here	1
we	1
are.	1
Whoa,	1
there,	1
whoa!"	1
	1
We	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
villa	1
which	1
stood	1
within	1
its	1
own	1
grounds.	1
A	1
stable-boy	1
had	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
horse's	1
head,	1
and	1
springing	1
down,	1
I	1
followed	1
Holmes	1
up	1
the	1
small,	1
winding	1
gravel-drive	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
As	1
we	1
approached,	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
blonde	1
woman	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
opening,	1
clad	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
light	1
mousseline	1
de	1
soie,	1
with	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
fluffy	1
pink	1
chiffon	1
at	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
wrists.	1
She	1
stood	1
with	1
her	1
figure	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
light,	1
one	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
door,	1
one	1
half-raised	1
in	1
her	1
eagerness,	1
her	1
body	1
slightly	1
bent,	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
face	1
protruded,	1
with	1
eager	1
eyes	1
and	1
parted	1
lips,	1
a	1
standing	1
question.	1
	1
"Well?"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"well?"	1
And	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
us,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
hope	1
which	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
groan	1
as	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
companion	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"No	1
good	1
news?"	1
	1
"None."	1
	1
"No	1
bad?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God	1
for	1
that.	1
But	1
come	1
in.	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
weary,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
day."	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
Dr.	1
Watson.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
of	1
most	1
vital	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
my	1
cases,	1
and	1
a	1
lucky	1
chance	1
has	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
associate	1
him	1
with	1
this	1
investigation."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
pressing	1
my	1
hand	1
warmly.	1
"You	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
forgive	1
anything	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
our	1
arrangements,	1
when	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
blow	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
so	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
us."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
campaigner,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
I	1
can	1
very	1
well	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
apology	1
is	1
needed.	1
If	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
assistance,	1
either	1
to	1
you	1
or	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
here,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
indeed	1
happy."	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
as	1
we	1
entered	1
a	1
well-lit	1
dining-room,	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
cold	1
supper	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
out,	1
"I	1
should	1
very	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
plain	1
questions,	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
plain	1
answer."	1
	1
"Certainly,	1
madam."	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
trouble	1
about	1
my	1
feelings.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
hysterical,	1
nor	1
given	1
to	1
fainting.	1
I	1
simply	1
wish	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
real,	1
real	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Upon	1
what	1
point?"	1
	1
"In	1
your	1
heart	1
of	1
hearts,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
Neville	1
is	1
alive?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
by	1
the	1
question.	1
"Frankly,	1
now!"	1
she	1
repeated,	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
looking	1
keenly	1
down	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
basket-chair.	1
	1
"Frankly,	1
then,	1
madam,	1
I	1
do	1
not."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
dead?"	1
	1
"I	1
do."	1
	1
"Murdered?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
that.	1
Perhaps."	1
	1
"And	1
on	1
what	1
day	1
did	1
he	1
meet	1
his	1
death?"	1
	1
"On	1
Monday."	1
	1
"Then	1
perhaps,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
to-day."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
galvanised.	1
	1
"What!"	1
he	1
roared.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
to-day."	1
She	1
stood	1
smiling,	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
slip	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
"May	1
I	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
He	1
snatched	1
it	1
from	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
eagerness,	1
and	1
smoothing	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
over	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
intently.	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
my	1
chair	1
and	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
The	1
envelope	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
coarse	1
one	1
and	1
was	1
stamped	1
with	1
the	1
Gravesend	1
postmark	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
that	1
very	1
day,	1
or	1
rather	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
considerably	1
after	1
midnight.	1
	1
"Coarse	1
writing,"	1
murmured	1
Holmes.	1
"Surely	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
husband's	1
writing,	1
madam."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
the	1
enclosure	1
is."	1
	1
"I	1
perceive	1
also	1
that	1
whoever	1
addressed	1
the	1
envelope	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
inquire	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
address."	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
that?"	1
	1
"The	1
name,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
in	1
perfectly	1
black	1
ink,	1
which	1
has	1
dried	1
itself.	1
The	1
rest	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
greyish	1
colour,	1
which	1
shows	1
that	1
blotting-paper	1
has	1
been	1
used.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
written	1
straight	1
off,	1
and	1
then	1
blotted,	1
none	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
deep	1
black	1
shade.	1
This	1
man	1
has	1
written	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
there	1
has	1
then	1
been	1
a	1
pause	1
before	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
address,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
familiar	1
with	1
it.	1
It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
a	1
trifle,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
important	1
as	1
trifles.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
see	1
the	1
letter.	1
Ha!	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
enclosure	1
here!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ring.	1
His	1
signet-ring."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
husband's	1
hand?"	1
	1
"One	1
of	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"One?"	1
	1
"His	1
hand	1
when	1
he	1
wrote	1
hurriedly.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
unlike	1
his	1
usual	1
writing,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
well."	1
	1
"'Dearest	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
frightened.	1
All	1
will	1
come	1
well.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
huge	1
error	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
take	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
to	1
rectify.	1
Wait	1
in	1
patience.--NEVILLE.'	1

in	1
pencil	1
upon	1
the	1
fly-leaf	1
of	1
a	1
book,	1
octavo	1
size,	1
no	1
water-mark.	1
Hum!	1
Posted	1
to-day	1
in	1
Gravesend	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
dirty	1
thumb.	1
Ha!	1
And	1
the	1
flap	1
has	1
been	1
gummed,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
error,	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
chewing	1
tobacco.	1
And	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
husband's	1
hand,	1
madam?"	1
	1
"None.	1
Neville	1
wrote	1
those	1
words."	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
were	1
posted	1
to-day	1
at	1
Gravesend.	1
Well,	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
the	1
clouds	1
lighten,	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
is	1
over."	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
alive,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Unless	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
forgery	1
to	1
put	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
scent.	1
The	1
ring,	1
after	1
all,	1
proves	1
nothing.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
very	1
own	1
writing!"	1
	1
"Very	1
well.	1
It	1
may,	1
however,	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
on	1
Monday	1
and	1
only	1
posted	1
to-day."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"If	1
so,	1
much	1
may	1
have	1
happened	1
between."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
discourage	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
keen	1
a	1
sympathy	1
between	1
us	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
know	1
if	1
evil	1
came	1
upon	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
last	1
he	1
cut	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
rushed	1
upstairs	1
instantly	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
certainty	1
that	1
something	1
had	1
happened.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
respond	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
trifle	1
and	1
yet	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
his	1
death?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
too	1
much	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
valuable	1
than	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
an	1
analytical	1
reasoner.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
letter	1
you	1
certainly	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
strong	1
piece	1
of	1
evidence	1
to	1
corroborate	1
your	1
view.	1
But	1
if	1
your	1
husband	1
is	1
alive	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
write	1
letters,	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
remain	1
away	1
from	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine.	1
It	1
is	1
unthinkable."	1
	1
"And	1
on	1
Monday	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
remarks	1
before	1
leaving	1
you?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
were	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
Swandam	1
Lane?"	1
	1
"Very	1
much	1
so."	1
	1
"Was	1
the	1
window	1
open?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Then	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
called	1
to	1
you?"	1
	1
"He	1
might."	1
	1
"He	1
only,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
gave	1
an	1
inarticulate	1
cry?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"A	1
call	1
for	1
help,	1
you	1
thought?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
He	1
waved	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise.	1
Astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
sight	1
of	1
you	1
might	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
throw	1
up	1
his	1
hands?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
pulled	1
back?"	1
	1
"He	1
disappeared	1
so	1
suddenly."	1
	1
"He	1
might	1
have	1
leaped	1
back.	1
You	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
anyone	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
this	1
horrible	1
man	1
confessed	1
to	1
having	1
been	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
Lascar	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
stairs."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Your	1
husband,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
see,	1
had	1
his	1
ordinary	1
clothes	1
on?"	1
	1
"But	1
without	1
his	1
collar	1
or	1
tie.	1
I	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
his	1
bare	1
throat."	1
	1
"Had	1
he	1
ever	1
spoken	1
of	1
Swandam	1
Lane?"	1
	1
"Never."	1
	1
"Had	1
he	1
ever	1
showed	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
having	1
taken	1
opium?"	1
	1
"Never."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
Mrs.	1
St.	1
Clair.	1
Those	1
are	1
the	1
principal	1
points	1
about	1
which	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
clear.	1
We	1
shall	1
now	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
supper	1
and	1
then	1
retire,	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
busy	1
day	1
to-morrow."	1
	1
A	1
large	1
and	1
comfortable	1
double-bedded	1
room	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
at	1
our	1
disposal,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
quickly	1
between	1
the	1
sheets,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
weary	1
after	1
my	1
night	1
of	1
adventure.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
however,	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
unsolved	1
problem	1
upon	1
his	1
mind,	1
would	1
go	1
for	1
days,	1
and	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
without	1
rest,	1
turning	1
it	1
over,	1
rearranging	1
his	1
facts,	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
either	1
fathomed	1
it	1
or	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
his	1
data	1
were	1
insufficient.	1
It	1
was	1
soon	1
evident	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
preparing	1
for	1
an	1
all-night	1
sitting.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
waistcoat,	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
blue	1
dressing-gown,	1
and	1
then	1
wandered	1
about	1
the	1
room	1
collecting	1
pillows	1
from	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
cushions	1
from	1
the	1
sofa	1
and	1
armchairs.	1
With	1
these	1
he	1
constructed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Eastern	1
divan,	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
perched	1
himself	1
cross-legged,	1
with	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
shag	1
tobacco	1
and	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
matches	1
laid	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
lamp	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
sitting	1
there,	1
an	1
old	1
briar	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
lips,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
vacantly	1
upon	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling,	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke	1
curling	1
up	1
from	1
him,	1
silent,	1
motionless,	1
with	1
the	1
light	1
shining	1
upon	1
his	1
strong-set	1
aquiline	1
features.	1
So	1
he	1
sat	1
as	1
I	1
dropped	1
off	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
sat	1
when	1
a	1
sudden	1
ejaculation	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
wake	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
the	1
summer	1
sun	1
shining	1
into	1
the	1
apartment.	1
The	1
pipe	1
was	1
still	1
between	1
his	1
lips,	1
the	1
smoke	1
still	1
curled	1
upward,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
dense	1
tobacco	1
haze,	1
but	1
nothing	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
shag	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
upon	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
	1
"Awake,	1
Watson?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Game	1
for	1
a	1
morning	1
drive?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"Then	1
dress.	1
No	1
one	1
is	1
stirring	1
yet,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
stable-boy	1
sleeps,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
have	1
the	1
trap	1
out."	1
He	1
chuckled	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
his	1
eyes	1
twinkled,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
a	1
different	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
sombre	1
thinker	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
	1
As	1
I	1
dressed	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
my	1
watch.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
stirring.	1
It	1
was	1
twenty-five	1
minutes	1
past	1
four.	1
I	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
when	1
Holmes	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
putting	1
in	1
the	1
horse.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
test	1
a	1
little	1
theory	1
of	1
mine,"	1
said	1
he,	1
pulling	1
on	1
his	1
boots.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
absolute	1
fools	1
in	1
Europe.	1
I	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
kicked	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
Charing	1
Cross.	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
now."	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
it?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
bathroom,"	1
he	1
answered.	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
joking,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
seeing	1
my	1
look	1
of	1
incredulity.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
Gladstone	1
bag.	1
Come	1
on,	1
my	1
boy,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
fit	1
the	1
lock."	1
	1
We	1
made	1
our	1
way	1
downstairs	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
bright	1
morning	1
sunshine.	1
In	1
the	1
road	1
stood	1
our	1
horse	1
and	1
trap,	1
with	1
the	1
half-clad	1
stable-boy	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
head.	1
We	1
both	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
dashed	1
down	1
the	1
London	1
Road.	1
A	1
few	1
country	1
carts	1
were	1
stirring,	1
bearing	1
in	1
vegetables	1
to	1
the	1
metropolis,	1
but	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
villas	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
were	1
as	1
silent	1
and	1
lifeless	1
as	1
some	1
city	1
in	1
a	1
dream.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
some	1
points	1
a	1
singular	1
case,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
flicking	1
the	1
horse	1
on	1
into	1
a	1
gallop.	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
blind	1
as	1
a	1
mole,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
learn	1
wisdom	1
late	1
than	1
never	1
to	1
learn	1
it	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
In	1
town	1
the	1
earliest	1
risers	1
were	1
just	1
beginning	1
to	1
look	1
sleepily	1
from	1
their	1
windows	1
as	1
we	1
drove	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
Surrey	1
side.	1
Passing	1
down	1
the	1
Waterloo	1
Bridge	1
Road	1
we	1
crossed	1
over	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
dashing	1
up	1
Wellington	1
Street	1
wheeled	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
Bow	1
Street.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
force,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
constables	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
saluted	1
him.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
held	1
the	1
horse's	1
head	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
led	1
us	1
in.	1
	1
"Who	1
is	1
on	1
duty?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
sir."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Bradstreet,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
A	1
tall,	1
stout	1
official	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
the	1
stone-flagged	1
passage,	1
in	1
a	1
peaked	1
cap	1
and	1
frogged	1
jacket.	1
"I	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
quiet	1
word	1
with	1
you,	1
Bradstreet."	1
"Certainly,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Step	1
into	1
my	1
room	1
here."	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
office-like	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
ledger	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
telephone	1
projecting	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
inspector	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
desk.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
	1
"I	1
called	1
about	1
that	1
beggarman,	1
Boone--the	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
charged	1
with	1
being	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
of	1
Lee."	1
	1
"Yes.	1
He	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
and	1
remanded	1
for	1
further	1
inquiries."	1
	1
"So	1
I	1
heard.	1
You	1
have	1
him	1
here?"	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
cells."	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
quiet?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
gives	1
no	1
trouble.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
dirty	1
scoundrel."	1
	1
"Dirty?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
we	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
wash	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
a	1
tinker's.	1
Well,	1
when	1
once	1
his	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
settled,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
regular	1
prison	1
bath;	1
and	1
I	1
think,	1
if	1
you	1
saw	1
him,	1
you	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
needed	1
it."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
very	1
much."	1
	1
"Would	1
you?	1
That	1
is	1
easily	1
done.	1
Come	1
this	1
way.	1
You	1
can	1
leave	1
your	1
bag."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I'll	1
take	1
it."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Come	1
this	1
way,	1
if	1
you	1
please."	1
He	1
led	1
us	1
down	1
a	1
passage,	1
opened	1
a	1
barred	1
door,	1
passed	1
down	1
a	1
winding	1
stair,	1
and	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
whitewashed	1
corridor	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
doors	1
on	1
each	1
side.	1
	1
"The	1
third	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
is	1
his,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
He	1
quietly	1
shot	1
back	1
a	1
panel	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
glanced	1
through.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
asleep,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
can	1
see	1
him	1
very	1
well."	1
	1
We	1
both	1
put	1
our	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
grating.	1
The	1
prisoner	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
us,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
sleep,	1
breathing	1
slowly	1
and	1
heavily.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
middle-sized	1
man,	1
coarsely	1
clad	1
as	1
became	1
his	1
calling,	1
with	1
a	1
coloured	1
shirt	1
protruding	1
through	1
the	1
rent	1
in	1
his	1
tattered	1
coat.	1
He	1
was,	1
as	1
the	1
inspector	1
had	1
said,	1
extremely	1
dirty,	1
but	1
the	1
grime	1
which	1
covered	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
its	1
repulsive	1
ugliness.	1
A	1
broad	1
wheal	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
scar	1
ran	1
right	1
across	1
it	1
from	1
eye	1
to	1
chin,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
contraction	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip,	1
so	1
that	1
three	1
teeth	1
were	1
exposed	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
snarl.	1
A	1
shock	1
of	1
very	1
bright	1
red	1
hair	1
grew	1
low	1
over	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
forehead.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
beauty,	1
isn't	1
he?"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
	1
"He	1
certainly	1
needs	1
a	1
wash,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
"I	1
had	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
might,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
bringing	1
the	1
tools	1
with	1
me."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
Gladstone	1
bag	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
took	1
out,	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
bath-sponge.	1
	1
"He!	1
he!	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
funny	1
one,"	1
chuckled	1
the	1
inspector.	1
	1
"Now,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
great	1
goodness	1
to	1
open	1
that	1
door	1
very	1
quietly,	1
we	1
will	1
soon	1
make	1
him	1
cut	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
respectable	1
figure."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
not,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"He	1
doesn't	1
look	1
a	1
credit	1
to	1
the	1
Bow	1
Street	1
cells,	1
does	1
he?"	1
He	1
slipped	1
his	1
key	1
into	1
the	1
lock,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
very	1
quietly	1
entered	1
the	1
cell.	1
The	1
sleeper	1
half	1
turned,	1
and	1
then	1
settled	1
down	1
once	1
more	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
slumber.	1
Holmes	1
stooped	1
to	1
the	1
water-jug,	1
moistened	1
his	1
sponge,	1
and	1
then	1
rubbed	1
it	1
twice	1
vigorously	1
across	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
face.	1
	1
"Let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"to	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
of	1
Lee,	1
in	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Kent."	1
	1
Never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
sight.	1
The	1
man's	1
face	1
peeled	1
off	1
under	1
the	1
sponge	1
like	1
the	1
bark	1
from	1
a	1
tree.	1
Gone	1
was	1
the	1
coarse	1
brown	1
tint!	1
Gone,	1
too,	1
was	1
the	1
horrid	1
scar	1
which	1
had	1
seamed	1
it	1
across,	1
and	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
repulsive	1
sneer	1
to	1
the	1
face!	1
A	1
twitch	1
brought	1
away	1
the	1
tangled	1
red	1
hair,	1
and	1
there,	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
bed,	1
was	1
a	1
pale,	1
sad-faced,	1
refined-looking	1
man,	1
black-haired	1
and	1
smooth-skinned,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
staring	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
sleepy	1
bewilderment.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
realising	1
the	1
exposure,	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
scream	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Great	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
"it	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
missing	1
man.	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
photograph."	1
	1
The	1
prisoner	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
reckless	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
abandons	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
destiny.	1
"Be	1
it	1
so,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
pray	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
charged	1
with?"	1
	1
"With	1
making	1
away	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.--	1
Oh,	1
come,	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
that	1
unless	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
attempted	1
suicide	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector	1
with	1
a	1
grin.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
twenty-seven	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
force,	1
but	1
this	1
really	1
takes	1
the	1
cake."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
am	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
no	1
crime	1
has	1
been	1
committed,	1
and	1
that,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
am	1
illegally	1
detained."	1
	1
"No	1
crime,	1
but	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
error	1
has	1
been	1
committed,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"You	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
better	1
to	1
have	1
trusted	1
your	1
wife."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
wife;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
children,"	1
groaned	1
the	1
prisoner.	1
"God	1
help	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
them	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
father.	1
My	1
God!	1
What	1
an	1
exposure!	1
What	1
can	1
I	1
do?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
couch	1
and	1
patted	1
him	1
kindly	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
law	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
matter	1
up,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"of	1
course	1
you	1
can	1
hardly	1
avoid	1
publicity.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
if	1
you	1
convince	1
the	1
police	1
authorities	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possible	1
case	1
against	1
you,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
reason	1
that	1
the	1
details	1
should	1
find	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
papers.	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet	1
would,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
make	1
notes	1
upon	1
anything	1
which	1
you	1
might	1
tell	1
us	1
and	1
submit	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
authorities.	1
The	1
case	1
would	1
then	1
never	1
go	1
into	1
court	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"God	1
bless	1
you!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prisoner	1
passionately.	1
"I	1
would	1
have	1
endured	1
imprisonment,	1
ay,	1
even	1
execution,	1
rather	1
than	1
have	1
left	1
my	1
miserable	1
secret	1
as	1
a	1
family	1
blot	1
to	1
my	1
children.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
have	1
ever	1
heard	1
my	1
story.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
schoolmaster	1
in	1
Chesterfield,	1
where	1
I	1
received	1
an	1
excellent	1
education.	1
I	1
travelled	1
in	1
my	1
youth,	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
stage,	1
and	1
finally	1
became	1
a	1
reporter	1
on	1
an	1
evening	1
paper	1
in	1
London.	1
One	1
day	1
my	1
editor	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
articles	1
upon	1
begging	1
in	1
the	1
metropolis,	1
and	1
I	1
volunteered	1
to	1
supply	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
point	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
my	1
adventures	1
started.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
trying	1
begging	1
as	1
an	1
amateur	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
get	1
the	1
facts	1
upon	1
which	1
to	1
base	1
my	1
articles.	1
When	1
an	1
actor	1
I	1
had,	1
of	1
course,	1
learned	1
all	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
making	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
famous	1
in	1
the	1
green-room	1
for	1
my	1
skill.	1
I	1
took	1
advantage	1
now	1
of	1
my	1
attainments.	1
I	1
painted	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
myself	1
as	1
pitiable	1
as	1
possible	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
scar	1
and	1
fixed	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
my	1
lip	1
in	1
a	1
twist	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
slip	1
of	1
flesh-coloured	1
plaster.	1
Then	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
head	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
an	1
appropriate	1
dress,	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
station	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
ostensibly	1
as	1
a	1
match-seller	1
but	1
really	1
as	1
a	1
beggar.	1
For	1
seven	1
hours	1
I	1
plied	1
my	1
trade,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
my	1
surprise	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
received	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
26s.	1
4d.	1
	1
"I	1
wrote	1
my	1
articles	1
and	1
thought	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
until,	1
some	1
time	1
later,	1
I	1
backed	1
a	1
bill	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
writ	1
served	1
upon	1
me	1
for	1
25	1
pounds.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end	1
where	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
a	1
sudden	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
begged	1
a	1
fortnight's	1
grace	1
from	1
the	1
creditor,	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
holiday	1
from	1
my	1
employers,	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
begging	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
under	1
my	1
disguise.	1
In	1
ten	1
days	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
had	1
paid	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
imagine	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
to	1
arduous	1
work	1
at	1
2	1
pounds	1
a	1
week	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
earn	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
by	1
smearing	1
my	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
paint,	1
laying	1
my	1
cap	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
sitting	1
still.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
fight	1
between	1
my	1
pride	1
and	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
the	1
dollars	1
won	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
I	1
threw	1
up	1
reporting	1
and	1
sat	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
first	1
chosen,	1
inspiring	1
pity	1
by	1
my	1
ghastly	1
face	1
and	1
filling	1
my	1
pockets	1
with	1
coppers.	1
Only	1
one	1
man	1
knew	1
my	1
secret.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
a	1
low	1
den	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
lodge	1
in	1
Swandam	1
Lane,	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
every	1
morning	1
emerge	1
as	1
a	1
squalid	1
beggar	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
transform	1
myself	1
into	1
a	1
well-dressed	1
man	1
about	1
town.	1
This	1
fellow,	1
a	1
Lascar,	1
was	1
well	1
paid	1
by	1
me	1
for	1
his	1
rooms,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
secret	1
was	1
safe	1
in	1
his	1
possession.	1
	1
"Well,	1
very	1
soon	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
saving	1
considerable	1
sums	1
of	1
money.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
any	1
beggar	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
London	1
could	1
earn	1
700	1
pounds	1
a	1
year--which	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
my	1
average	1
takings--but	1
I	1
had	1
exceptional	1
advantages	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
up,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
facility	1
of	1
repartee,	1
which	1
improved	1
by	1
practice	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
quite	1
a	1
recognised	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
City.	1
All	1
day	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
pennies,	1
varied	1
by	1
silver,	1
poured	1
in	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
failed	1
to	1
take	1
2	1
pounds.	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
grew	1
richer	1
I	1
grew	1
more	1
ambitious,	1
took	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
eventually	1
married,	1
without	1
anyone	1
having	1
a	1
suspicion	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
real	1
occupation.	1
My	1
dear	1
wife	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
business	1
in	1
the	1
City.	1
She	1
little	1
knew	1
what.	1
	1
"Last	1
Monday	1
I	1
had	1
finished	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
was	1
dressing	1
in	1
my	1
room	1
above	1
the	1
opium	1
den	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
window	1
and	1
saw,	1
to	1
my	1
horror	1
and	1
astonishment,	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
full	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
gave	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
surprise,	1
threw	1
up	1
my	1
arms	1
to	1
cover	1
my	1
face,	1
and,	1
rushing	1
to	1
my	1
confidant,	1
the	1
Lascar,	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
prevent	1
anyone	1
from	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
voice	1
downstairs,	1
but	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
ascend.	1
Swiftly	1
I	1
threw	1
off	1
my	1
clothes,	1
pulled	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
beggar,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
pigments	1
and	1
wig.	1
Even	1
a	1
wife's	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
pierce	1
so	1
complete	1
a	1
disguise.	1
But	1
then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
search	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
clothes	1
might	1
betray	1
me.	1
I	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
reopening	1
by	1
my	1
violence	1
a	1
small	1
cut	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom	1
that	1
morning.	1
Then	1
I	1
seized	1
my	1
coat,	1
which	1
was	1
weighted	1
by	1
the	1
coppers	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
transferred	1
to	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
leather	1
bag	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
carried	1
my	1
takings.	1
I	1
hurled	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
it	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
Thames.	1
The	1
other	1
clothes	1
would	1
have	1
followed,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rush	1
of	1
constables	1
up	1
the	1
stair,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
I	1
found,	1
rather,	1
I	1
confess,	1
to	1
my	1
relief,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
identified	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Neville	1
St.	1
Clair,	1
I	1
was	1
arrested	1
as	1
his	1
murderer.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
else	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
explain.	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
disguise	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
hence	1
my	1
preference	1
for	1
a	1
dirty	1
face.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
would	1
be	1
terribly	1
anxious,	1
I	1
slipped	1
off	1
my	1
ring	1
and	1
confided	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Lascar	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
no	1
constable	1
was	1
watching	1
me,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
hurried	1
scrawl,	1
telling	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
fear."	1
	1
"That	1
note	1
only	1
reached	1
her	1
yesterday,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Good	1
God!	1
What	1
a	1
week	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
spent!"	1
	1
"The	1
police	1
have	1
watched	1
this	1
Lascar,"	1
said	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
"and	1
I	1
can	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
post	1
a	1
letter	1
unobserved.	1
Probably	1
he	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
some	1
sailor	1
customer	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
some	1
days."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
nodding	1
approvingly;	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
have	1
you	1
never	1
been	1
prosecuted	1
for	1
begging?"	1
	1
"Many	1
times;	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
stop	1
here,	1
however,"	1
said	1
Bradstreet.	1
"If	1
the	1
police	1
are	1
to	1
hush	1
this	1
thing	1
up,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
Hugh	1
Boone."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
sworn	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
oaths	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
take."	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
no	1
further	1
steps	1
may	1
be	1
taken.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
found	1
again,	1
then	1
all	1
must	1
come	1
out.	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
indebted	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
having	1
cleared	1
the	1
matter	1
up.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
you	1
reach	1
your	1
results."	1
	1
"I	1
reached	1
this	1
one,"	1
said	1
my	1
friend,	1
"by	1
sitting	1
upon	1
five	1
pillows	1
and	1
consuming	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
shag.	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
drive	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street	1
we	1
shall	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
breakfast."	1
	1
	1
	1
VII.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
BLUE	1
CARBUNCLE	1
	1
I	1
had	1
called	1
upon	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
upon	1
the	1
second	1
morning	1
after	1
Christmas,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
wishing	1
him	1
the	1
compliments	1
of	1
the	1
season.	1
He	1
was	1
lounging	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
purple	1
dressing-gown,	1
a	1
pipe-rack	1
within	1
his	1
reach	1
upon	1
the	1
right,	1
and	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
crumpled	1
morning	1
papers,	1
evidently	1
newly	1
studied,	1
near	1
at	1
hand.	1
Beside	1
the	1
couch	1
was	1
a	1
wooden	1
chair,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
back	1
hung	1
a	1
very	1
seedy	1
and	1
disreputable	1
hard-felt	1
hat,	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
wear,	1
and	1
cracked	1
in	1
several	1
places.	1
A	1
lens	1
and	1
a	1
forceps	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
hat	1
had	1
been	1
suspended	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
examination.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
I;	1
"perhaps	1
I	1
interrupt	1
you."	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
discuss	1
my	1
results.	1
The	1
matter	1
is	1
a	1
perfectly	1
trivial	1
one"--he	1
jerked	1
his	1
thumb	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
hat--"but	1
there	1
are	1
points	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
it	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
entirely	1
devoid	1
of	1
interest	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
instruction."	1
	1
I	1
seated	1
myself	1
in	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
warmed	1
my	1
hands	1
before	1
his	1
crackling	1
fire,	1
for	1
a	1
sharp	1
frost	1
had	1
set	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
thick	1
with	1
the	1
ice	1
crystals.	1
"I	1
suppose,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"that,	1
homely	1
as	1
it	1
looks,	1
this	1
thing	1
has	1
some	1
deadly	1
story	1
linked	1
on	1
to	1
it--that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
clue	1
which	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
some	1
mystery	1
and	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
some	1
crime."	1
	1
"No,	1
no.	1
No	1
crime,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"Only	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whimsical	1
little	1
incidents	1
which	1
will	1
happen	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
four	1
million	1
human	1
beings	1
all	1
jostling	1
each	1
other	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
square	1
miles.	1
Amid	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
reaction	1
of	1
so	1
dense	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
humanity,	1
every	1
possible	1
combination	1
of	1
events	1
may	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
take	1
place,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
little	1
problem	1
will	1
be	1
presented	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
striking	1
and	1
bizarre	1
without	1
being	1
criminal.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
had	1
experience	1
of	1
such."	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
so,"	1
I	1
remarked,	1
"that	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
six	1
cases	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
added	1
to	1
my	1
notes,	1
three	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
free	1
of	1
any	1
legal	1
crime."	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
You	1
allude	1
to	1
my	1
attempt	1
to	1
recover	1
the	1
Irene	1
Adler	1
papers,	1
to	1
the	1
singular	1
case	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip.	1
Well,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
small	1
matter	1
will	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
innocent	1
category.	1
You	1
know	1
Peterson,	1
the	1
commissionaire?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
trophy	1
belongs."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
his	1
hat."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
he	1
found	1
it.	1
Its	1
owner	1
is	1
unknown.	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
battered	1
billycock	1
but	1
as	1
an	1
intellectual	1
problem.	1
And,	1
first,	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
it	1
came	1
here.	1
It	1
arrived	1
upon	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
fat	1
goose,	1
which	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt,	1
roasting	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Peterson's	1
fire.	1
The	1
facts	1
are	1
these:	1
about	1
four	1
o'clock	1
on	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
Peterson,	1
who,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
honest	1
fellow,	1
was	1
returning	1
from	1
some	1
small	1
jollification	1
and	1
was	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
homeward	1
down	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
saw,	1
in	1
the	1
gaslight,	1
a	1
tallish	1
man,	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
stagger,	1
and	1
carrying	1
a	1
white	1
goose	1
slung	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
As	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Goodge	1
Street,	1
a	1
row	1
broke	1
out	1
between	1
this	1
stranger	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
knot	1
of	1
roughs.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
knocked	1
off	1
the	1
man's	1
hat,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
stick	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
and,	1
swinging	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
smashed	1
the	1
shop	1
window	1
behind	1
him.	1
Peterson	1
had	1
rushed	1
forward	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
stranger	1
from	1
his	1
assailants;	1
but	1
the	1
man,	1
shocked	1
at	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
seeing	1
an	1
official-looking	1
person	1
in	1
uniform	1
rushing	1
towards	1
him,	1
dropped	1
his	1
goose,	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels,	1
and	1
vanished	1
amid	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
small	1
streets	1
which	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road.	1
The	1
roughs	1
had	1
also	1
fled	1
at	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Peterson,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
victory	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
this	1
battered	1
hat	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
unimpeachable	1
Christmas	1
goose."	1
	1
"Which	1
surely	1
he	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
owner?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
there	1
lies	1
the	1
problem.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
'For	1
Mrs.	1
Henry	1
Baker'	1
was	1
printed	1
upon	1
a	1
small	1
card	1
which	1
was	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
bird's	1
left	1
leg,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
initials	1
'H.	1
B.'	1
are	1
legible	1
upon	1
the	1
lining	1
of	1
this	1
hat,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
thousands	1
of	1
Bakers,	1
and	1
some	1
hundreds	1
of	1
Henry	1
Bakers	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
of	1
ours,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
restore	1
lost	1
property	1
to	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"What,	1
then,	1
did	1
Peterson	1
do?"	1
	1
"He	1
brought	1
round	1
both	1
hat	1
and	1
goose	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
Christmas	1
morning,	1
knowing	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
smallest	1
problems	1
are	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
me.	1
The	1
goose	1
we	1
retained	1
until	1
this	1
morning,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
signs	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
slight	1
frost,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
eaten	1
without	1
unnecessary	1
delay.	1
Its	1
finder	1
has	1
carried	1
it	1
off,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
ultimate	1
destiny	1
of	1
a	1
goose,	1
while	1
I	1
continue	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
unknown	1
gentleman	1
who	1
lost	1
his	1
Christmas	1
dinner."	1
	1
"Did	1
he	1
not	1
advertise?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"Then,	1
what	1
clue	1
could	1
you	1
have	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
identity?"	1
	1
"Only	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
deduce."	1
	1
"From	1
his	1
hat?"	1
	1
"Precisely."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
are	1
joking.	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
this	1
old	1
battered	1
felt?"	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
my	1
lens.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
methods.	1
What	1
can	1
you	1
gather	1
yourself	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
individuality	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
worn	1
this	1
article?"	1
	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
tattered	1
object	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
over	1
rather	1
ruefully.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
ordinary	1
black	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
usual	1
round	1
shape,	1
hard	1
and	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
wear.	1
The	1
lining	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
red	1
silk,	1
but	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
discoloured.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
maker's	1
name;	1
but,	1
as	1
Holmes	1
had	1
remarked,	1
the	1
initials	1
"H.	1
B."	1
were	1
scrawled	1
upon	1
one	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
pierced	1
in	1
the	1
brim	1
for	1
a	1
hat-securer,	1
but	1
the	1
elastic	1
was	1
missing.	1
For	1
the	1
rest,	1
it	1
was	1
cracked,	1
exceedingly	1
dusty,	1
and	1
spotted	1
in	1
several	1
places,	1
although	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
attempt	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
discoloured	1
patches	1
by	1
smearing	1
them	1
with	1
ink.	1
	1
"I	1
can	1
see	1
nothing,"	1
said	1
I,	1
handing	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
friend.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
everything.	1
You	1
fail,	1
however,	1
to	1
reason	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
see.	1
You	1
are	1
too	1
timid	1
in	1
drawing	1
your	1
inferences."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
infer	1
from	1
this	1
hat?"	1
	1
He	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
peculiar	1
introspective	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
less	1
suggestive	1
than	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"and	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
inferences	1
which	1
are	1
very	1
distinct,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
others	1
which	1
represent	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
strong	1
balance	1
of	1
probability.	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
highly	1
intellectual	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
obvious	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
fairly	1
well-to-do	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
three	1
years,	1
although	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
fallen	1
upon	1
evil	1
days.	1
He	1
had	1
foresight,	1
but	1
has	1
less	1
now	1
than	1
formerly,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
moral	1
retrogression,	1
which,	1
when	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes,	1
seems	1
to	1
indicate	1
some	1
evil	1
influence,	1
probably	1
drink,	1
at	1
work	1
upon	1
him.	1
This	1
may	1
account	1
also	1
for	1
the	1
obvious	1
fact	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
has	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"He	1
has,	1
however,	1
retained	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
self-respect,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
disregarding	1
my	1
remonstrance.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
sedentary	1
life,	1
goes	1
out	1
little,	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
training	1
entirely,	1
is	1
middle-aged,	1
has	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
cut	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
anoints	1
with	1
lime-cream.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
patent	1
facts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
his	1
hat.	1
Also,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
improbable	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
gas	1
laid	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
house."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
certainly	1
joking,	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
when	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
these	1
results,	1
you	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
are	1
attained?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
stupid,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
you.	1
For	1
example,	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
deduce	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
intellectual?"	1
	1
For	1
answer	1
Holmes	1
clapped	1
the	1
hat	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
It	1
came	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
settled	1
upon	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
cubic	1
capacity,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"a	1
man	1
with	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
brain	1
must	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
it."	1
	1
"The	1
decline	1
of	1
his	1
fortunes,	1
then?"	1
	1
"This	1
hat	1
is	1
three	1
years	1
old.	1
These	1
flat	1
brims	1
curled	1
at	1
the	1
edge	1
came	1
in	1
then.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
hat	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
quality.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
ribbed	1
silk	1
and	1
the	1
excellent	1
lining.	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
could	1
afford	1
to	1
buy	1
so	1
expensive	1
a	1
hat	1
three	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
has	1
had	1
no	1
hat	1
since,	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
assuredly	1
gone	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
clear	1
enough,	1
certainly.	1
But	1
how	1
about	1
the	1
foresight	1
and	1
the	1
moral	1
retrogression?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
laughed.	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
foresight,"	1
said	1
he	1
putting	1
his	1
finger	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
disc	1
and	1
loop	1
of	1
the	1
hat-securer.	1
"They	1
are	1
never	1
sold	1
upon	1
hats.	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
ordered	1
one,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
foresight,	1
since	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
this	1
precaution	1
against	1
the	1
wind.	1
But	1
since	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
broken	1
the	1
elastic	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
troubled	1
to	1
replace	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
less	1
foresight	1
now	1
than	1
formerly,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
proof	1
of	1
a	1
weakening	1
nature.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
he	1
has	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
conceal	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
stains	1
upon	1
the	1
felt	1
by	1
daubing	1
them	1
with	1
ink,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
entirely	1
lost	1
his	1
self-respect."	1
	1
"Your	1
reasoning	1
is	1
certainly	1
plausible."	1
	1
"The	1
further	1
points,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
middle-aged,	1
that	1
his	1
hair	1
is	1
grizzled,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
recently	1
cut,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
uses	1
lime-cream,	1
are	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
a	1
close	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lining.	1
The	1
lens	1
discloses	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
hair-ends,	1
clean	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
scissors	1
of	1
the	1
barber.	1
They	1
all	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
adhesive,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
odour	1
of	1
lime-cream.	1
This	1
dust,	1
you	1
will	1
observe,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
gritty,	1
grey	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
but	1
the	1
fluffy	1
brown	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
showing	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
hung	1
up	1
indoors	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time,	1
while	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
moisture	1
upon	1
the	1
inside	1
are	1
proof	1
positive	1
that	1
the	1
wearer	1
perspired	1
very	1
freely,	1
and	1
could	1
therefore,	1
hardly	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
training."	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
wife--you	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
him."	1
	1
"This	1
hat	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
brushed	1
for	1
weeks.	1
When	1
I	1
see	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
with	1
a	1
week's	1
accumulation	1
of	1
dust	1
upon	1
your	1
hat,	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
wife	1
allows	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state,	1
I	1
shall	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
also	1
have	1
been	1
unfortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
lose	1
your	1
wife's	1
affection."	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
bachelor."	1
	1
"Nay,	1
he	1
was	1
bringing	1
home	1
the	1
goose	1
as	1
a	1
peace-offering	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
Remember	1
the	1
card	1
upon	1
the	1
bird's	1
leg."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
everything.	1
But	1
how	1
on	1
earth	1
do	1
you	1
deduce	1
that	1
the	1
gas	1
is	1
not	1
laid	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
house?"	1
	1
"One	1
tallow	1
stain,	1
or	1
even	1
two,	1
might	1
come	1
by	1
chance;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
five,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
individual	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
frequent	1
contact	1
with	1
burning	1
tallow--walks	1
upstairs	1
at	1
night	1
probably	1
with	1
his	1
hat	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
guttering	1
candle	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Anyhow,	1
he	1
never	1
got	1
tallow-stains	1
from	1
a	1
gas-jet.	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
ingenious,"	1
said	1
I,	1
laughing;	1
"but	1
since,	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now,	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
crime	1
committed,	1
and	1
no	1
harm	1
done	1
save	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
goose,	1
all	1
this	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
energy."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
flew	1
open,	1
and	1
Peterson,	1
the	1
commissionaire,	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
apartment	1
with	1
flushed	1
cheeks	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
dazed	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
	1
"The	1
goose,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes!	1
The	1
goose,	1
sir!"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What	1
of	1
it,	1
then?	1
Has	1
it	1
returned	1
to	1
life	1
and	1
flapped	1
off	1
through	1
the	1
kitchen	1
window?"	1
Holmes	1
twisted	1
himself	1
round	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
fairer	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
man's	1
excited	1
face.	1
	1
"See	1
here,	1
sir!	1
See	1
what	1
my	1
wife	1
found	1
in	1
its	1
crop!"	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
displayed	1
upon	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
palm	1
a	1
brilliantly	1
scintillating	1
blue	1
stone,	1
rather	1
smaller	1
than	1
a	1
bean	1
in	1
size,	1
but	1
of	1
such	1
purity	1
and	1
radiance	1
that	1
it	1
twinkled	1
like	1
an	1
electric	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
whistle.	1
"By	1
Jove,	1
Peterson!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"this	1
is	1
treasure	1
trove	1
indeed.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
got?"	1
	1
"A	1
diamond,	1
sir?	1
A	1
precious	1
stone.	1
It	1
cuts	1
into	1
glass	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
putty."	1
	1
"It's	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
precious	1
stone.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
precious	1
stone."	1
	1
"Not	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar's	1
blue	1
carbuncle!"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
its	1
size	1
and	1
shape,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
advertisement	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
The	1
Times	1
every	1
day	1
lately.	1
It	1
is	1
absolutely	1
unique,	1
and	1
its	1
value	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
conjectured,	1
but	1
the	1
reward	1
offered	1
of	1
1000	1
pounds	1
is	1
certainly	1
not	1
within	1
a	1
twentieth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
market	1
price."	1
	1
"A	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
Great	1
Lord	1
of	1
mercy!"	1
The	1
commissionaire	1
plumped	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
stared	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
reward,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
sentimental	1
considerations	1
in	1
the	1
background	1
which	1
would	1
induce	1
the	1
Countess	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
half	1
her	1
fortune	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
but	1
recover	1
the	1
gem."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
lost,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
aright,	1
at	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so,	1
on	1
December	1
22nd,	1
just	1
five	1
days	1
ago.	1
John	1
Horner,	1
a	1
plumber,	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
having	1
abstracted	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
lady's	1
jewel-case.	1
The	1
evidence	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
here,	1
I	1
believe."	1
He	1
rummaged	1
amid	1
his	1
newspapers,	1
glancing	1
over	1
the	1
dates,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
smoothed	1
one	1
out,	1
doubled	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
following	1
paragraph:	1
	1
"Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan	1
Jewel	1
Robbery.	1
John	1
Horner,	1
26,	1
plumber,	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
having	1
upon	1
the	1
22nd	1
inst.,	1
abstracted	1
from	1
the	1
jewel-case	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar	1
the	1
valuable	1
gem	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle.	1
James	1
Ryder,	1
upper-attendant	1
at	1
the	1
hotel,	1
gave	1
his	1
evidence	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shown	1
Horner	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dressing-room	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar	1
upon	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
robbery	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
solder	1
the	1
second	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
grate,	1
which	1
was	1
loose.	1
He	1
had	1
remained	1
with	1
Horner	1
some	1
little	1
time,	1
but	1
had	1
finally	1
been	1
called	1
away.	1
On	1
returning,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
Horner	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
that	1
the	1
bureau	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
open,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
small	1
morocco	1
casket	1
in	1
which,	1
as	1
it	1
afterwards	1
transpired,	1
the	1
Countess	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
jewel,	1
was	1
lying	1
empty	1
upon	1
the	1
dressing-table.	1
Ryder	1
instantly	1
gave	1
the	1
alarm,	1
and	1
Horner	1
was	1
arrested	1
the	1
same	1
evening;	1
but	1
the	1
stone	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
either	1
upon	1
his	1
person	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
rooms.	1
Catherine	1
Cusack,	1
maid	1
to	1
the	1
Countess,	1
deposed	1
to	1
having	1
heard	1
Ryder's	1
cry	1
of	1
dismay	1
on	1
discovering	1
the	1
robbery,	1
and	1
to	1
having	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
matters	1
as	1
described	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
witness.	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
B	1
division,	1
gave	1
evidence	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
arrest	1
of	1
Horner,	1
who	1
struggled	1
frantically,	1
and	1
protested	1
his	1
innocence	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
terms.	1
Evidence	1
of	1
a	1
previous	1
conviction	1
for	1
robbery	1
having	1
been	1
given	1
against	1
the	1
prisoner,	1
the	1
magistrate	1
refused	1
to	1
deal	1
summarily	1
with	1
the	1
offence,	1
but	1
referred	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Assizes.	1
Horner,	1
who	1
had	1
shown	1
signs	1
of	1
intense	1
emotion	1
during	1
the	1
proceedings,	1
fainted	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
conclusion	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
out	1
of	1
court."	1
	1
"Hum!	1
So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
police-court,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
thoughtfully,	1
tossing	1
aside	1
the	1
paper.	1
"The	1
question	1
for	1
us	1
now	1
to	1
solve	1
is	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
events	1
leading	1
from	1
a	1
rifled	1
jewel-case	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
crop	1
of	1
a	1
goose	1
in	1
Tottenham	1
Court	1
Road	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
You	1
see,	1
Watson,	1
our	1
little	1
deductions	1
have	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
important	1
and	1
less	1
innocent	1
aspect.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
stone;	1
the	1
stone	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
goose,	1
and	1
the	1
goose	1
came	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
bad	1
hat	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
characteristics	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
bored	1
you.	1
So	1
now	1
we	1
must	1
set	1
ourselves	1
very	1
seriously	1
to	1
finding	1
this	1
gentleman	1
and	1
ascertaining	1
what	1
part	1
he	1
has	1
played	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
mystery.	1
To	1
do	1
this,	1
we	1
must	1
try	1
the	1
simplest	1
means	1
first,	1
and	1
these	1
lie	1
undoubtedly	1
in	1
an	1
advertisement	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
papers.	1
If	1
this	1
fail,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
other	1
methods."	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
pencil	1
and	1
that	1
slip	1
of	1
paper.	1
Now,	1
then:	1
'Found	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
Goodge	1
Street,	1
a	1
goose	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
felt	1
hat.	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
by	1
applying	1
at	1
6:30	1
this	1
evening	1
at	1
221B,	1
Baker	1
Street.'	1
That	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
concise."	1
	1
"Very.	1
But	1
will	1
he	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
he	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
papers,	1
since,	1
to	1
a	1
poor	1
man,	1
the	1
loss	1
was	1
a	1
heavy	1
one.	1
He	1
was	1
clearly	1
so	1
scared	1
by	1
his	1
mischance	1
in	1
breaking	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
Peterson	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
flight,	1
but	1
since	1
then	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
bitterly	1
regretted	1
the	1
impulse	1
which	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
drop	1
his	1
bird.	1
Then,	1
again,	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
will	1
cause	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
it,	1
for	1
everyone	1
who	1
knows	1
him	1
will	1
direct	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
Here	1
you	1
are,	1
Peterson,	1
run	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
advertising	1
agency	1
and	1
have	1
this	1
put	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
papers."	1
	1
"In	1
which,	1
sir?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
in	1
the	1
Globe,	1
Star,	1
Pall	1
Mall,	1
St.	1
James's,	1
Evening	1
News,	1
Standard,	1
Echo,	1
and	1
any	1
others	1
that	1
occur	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
sir.	1
And	1
this	1
stone?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
the	1
stone.	1
Thank	1
you.	1
And,	1
I	1
say,	1
Peterson,	1
just	1
buy	1
a	1
goose	1
on	1
your	1
way	1
back	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
here	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
your	1
family	1
is	1
now	1
devouring."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
commissionaire	1
had	1
gone,	1
Holmes	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
against	1
the	1
light.	1
"It's	1
a	1
bonny	1
thing,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Just	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
glints	1
and	1
sparkles.	1
Of	1
course	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
nucleus	1
and	1
focus	1
of	1
crime.	1
Every	1
good	1
stone	1
is.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
devil's	1
pet	1
baits.	1
In	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
older	1
jewels	1
every	1
facet	1
may	1
stand	1
for	1
a	1
bloody	1
deed.	1
This	1
stone	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
twenty	1
years	1
old.	1
It	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Amoy	1
River	1
in	1
southern	1
China	1
and	1
is	1
remarkable	1
in	1
having	1
every	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
carbuncle,	1
save	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
blue	1
in	1
shade	1
instead	1
of	1
ruby	1
red.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
youth,	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
a	1
sinister	1
history.	1
There	1
have	1
been	1
two	1
murders,	1
a	1
vitriol-throwing,	1
a	1
suicide,	1
and	1
several	1
robberies	1
brought	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
this	1
forty-grain	1
weight	1
of	1
crystallised	1
charcoal.	1
Who	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
so	1
pretty	1
a	1
toy	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
purveyor	1
to	1
the	1
gallows	1
and	1
the	1
prison?	1
I'll	1
lock	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
strong	1
box	1
now	1
and	1
drop	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
it."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Horner	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
this	1
other	1
one,	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
I	1
think,	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
that	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
is	1
an	1
absolutely	1
innocent	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
bird	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
was	1
of	1
considerably	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
solid	1
gold.	1
That,	1
however,	1
I	1
shall	1
determine	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
test	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
our	1
advertisement."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
then?"	1
	1
"Nothing."	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
I	1
shall	1
continue	1
my	1
professional	1
round.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
you	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
so	1
tangled	1
a	1
business."	1
	1
"Very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
I	1
dine	1
at	1
seven.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
woodcock,	1
I	1
believe.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
recent	1
occurrences,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
ask	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
to	1
examine	1
its	1
crop."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
delayed	1
at	1
a	1
case,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
half-past	1
six	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street	1
once	1
more.	1
As	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
house	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
Scotch	1
bonnet	1
with	1
a	1
coat	1
which	1
was	1
buttoned	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
chin	1
waiting	1
outside	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
semicircle	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
from	1
the	1
fanlight.	1
Just	1
as	1
I	1
arrived	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
shown	1
up	1
together	1
to	1
Holmes'	1
room.	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
I	1
believe,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
greeting	1
his	1
visitor	1
with	1
the	1
easy	1
air	1
of	1
geniality	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
so	1
readily	1
assume.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
this	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
Mr.	1
Baker.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
cold	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
your	1
circulation	1
is	1
more	1
adapted	1
for	1
summer	1
than	1
for	1
winter.	1
Ah,	1
Watson,	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time.	1
Is	1
that	1
your	1
hat,	1
Mr.	1
Baker?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
that	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
my	1
hat."	1
	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
man	1
with	1
rounded	1
shoulders,	1
a	1
massive	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
broad,	1
intelligent	1
face,	1
sloping	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
pointed	1
beard	1
of	1
grizzled	1
brown.	1
A	1
touch	1
of	1
red	1
in	1
nose	1
and	1
cheeks,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
tremor	1
of	1
his	1
extended	1
hand,	1
recalled	1
Holmes'	1
surmise	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
habits.	1
His	1
rusty	1
black	1
frock-coat	1
was	1
buttoned	1
right	1
up	1
in	1
front,	1
with	1
the	1
collar	1
turned	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
lank	1
wrists	1
protruded	1
from	1
his	1
sleeves	1
without	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
cuff	1
or	1
shirt.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
slow	1
staccato	1
fashion,	1
choosing	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
care,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
impression	1
generally	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
learning	1
and	1
letters	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
ill-usage	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
fortune.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
retained	1
these	1
things	1
for	1
some	1
days,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"because	1
we	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
an	1
advertisement	1
from	1
you	1
giving	1
your	1
address.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
know	1
now	1
why	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
advertise."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
gave	1
a	1
rather	1
shamefaced	1
laugh.	1
"Shillings	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
plentiful	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
once	1
were,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"I	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
gang	1
of	1
roughs	1
who	1
assaulted	1
me	1
had	1
carried	1
off	1
both	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
the	1
bird.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
spend	1
more	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
hopeless	1
attempt	1
at	1
recovering	1
them."	1
	1
"Very	1
naturally.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
about	1
the	1
bird,	1
we	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
eat	1
it."	1
	1
"To	1
eat	1
it!"	1
Our	1
visitor	1
half	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
excitement.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
anyone	1
had	1
we	1
not	1
done	1
so.	1
But	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
this	1
other	1
goose	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
weight	1
and	1
perfectly	1
fresh,	1
will	1
answer	1
your	1
purpose	1
equally	1
well?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
certainly,	1
certainly,"	1
answered	1
Mr.	1
Baker	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
we	1
still	1
have	1
the	1
feathers,	1
legs,	1
crop,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
bird,	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
wish--"	1
	1
The	1
man	1
burst	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
laugh.	1
"They	1
might	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
relics	1
of	1
my	1
adventure,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
beyond	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
see	1
what	1
use	1
the	1
disjecta	1
membra	1
of	1
my	1
late	1
acquaintance	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
me.	1
No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
think	1
that,	1
with	1
your	1
permission,	1
I	1
will	1
confine	1
my	1
attentions	1
to	1
the	1
excellent	1
bird	1
which	1
I	1
perceive	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
glanced	1
sharply	1
across	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
shrug	1
of	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
your	1
hat,	1
then,	1
and	1
there	1
your	1
bird,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
would	1
it	1
bore	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
got	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
from?	1
I	1
am	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
fowl	1
fancier,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seldom	1
seen	1
a	1
better	1
grown	1
goose."	1
	1
"Certainly,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Baker,	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
tucked	1
his	1
newly	1
gained	1
property	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
frequent	1
the	1
Alpha	1
Inn,	1
near	1
the	1
Museum--we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Museum	1
itself	1
during	1
the	1
day,	1
you	1
understand.	1
This	1
year	1
our	1
good	1
host,	1
Windigate	1
by	1
name,	1
instituted	1
a	1
goose	1
club,	1
by	1
which,	1
on	1
consideration	1
of	1
some	1
few	1
pence	1
every	1
week,	1
we	1
were	1
each	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
bird	1
at	1
Christmas.	1
My	1
pence	1
were	1
duly	1
paid,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
indebted	1
to	1
you,	1
sir,	1
for	1
a	1
Scotch	1
bonnet	1
is	1
fitted	1
neither	1
to	1
my	1
years	1
nor	1
my	1
gravity."	1
With	1
a	1
comical	1
pomposity	1
of	1
manner	1
he	1
bowed	1
solemnly	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
strode	1
off	1
upon	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him.	1
"It	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
about	1
the	1
matter.	1
Are	1
you	1
hungry,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"Not	1
particularly."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
suggest	1
that	1
we	1
turn	1
our	1
dinner	1
into	1
a	1
supper	1
and	1
follow	1
up	1
this	1
clue	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
hot."	1
	1
"By	1
all	1
means."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bitter	1
night,	1
so	1
we	1
drew	1
on	1
our	1
ulsters	1
and	1
wrapped	1
cravats	1
about	1
our	1
throats.	1
Outside,	1
the	1
stars	1
were	1
shining	1
coldly	1
in	1
a	1
cloudless	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
passers-by	1
blew	1
out	1
into	1
smoke	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
pistol	1
shots.	1
Our	1
footfalls	1
rang	1
out	1
crisply	1
and	1
loudly	1
as	1
we	1
swung	1
through	1
the	1
doctors'	1
quarter,	1
Wimpole	1
Street,	1
Harley	1
Street,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
Wigmore	1
Street	1
into	1
Oxford	1
Street.	1
In	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Bloomsbury	1
at	1
the	1
Alpha	1
Inn,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
public-house	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
which	1
runs	1
down	1
into	1
Holborn.	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
bar	1
and	1
ordered	1
two	1
glasses	1
of	1
beer	1
from	1
the	1
ruddy-faced,	1
white-aproned	1
landlord.	1
	1
"Your	1
beer	1
should	1
be	1
excellent	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
your	1
geese,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"My	1
geese!"	1
The	1
man	1
seemed	1
surprised.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
only	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
your	1
goose	1
club."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
yes,	1
I	1
see.	1
But	1
you	1
see,	1
sir,	1
them's	1
not	1
our	1
geese."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
Whose,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
got	1
the	1
two	1
dozen	1
from	1
a	1
salesman	1
in	1
Covent	1
Garden."	1
	1
"Indeed?	1
I	1
know	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
Which	1
was	1
it?"	1
	1
"Breckinridge	1
is	1
his	1
name."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
him.	1
Well,	1
here's	1
your	1
good	1
health	1
landlord,	1
and	1
prosperity	1
to	1
your	1
house.	1
Good-night."	1
	1
"Now	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Breckinridge,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
we	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
frosty	1
air.	1
"Remember,	1
Watson	1
that	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
homely	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
goose	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
chain,	1
we	1
have	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
will	1
certainly	1
get	1
seven	1
years'	1
penal	1
servitude	1
unless	1
we	1
can	1
establish	1
his	1
innocence.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
our	1
inquiry	1
may	1
but	1
confirm	1
his	1
guilt;	1
but,	1
in	1
any	1
case,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
investigation	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
missed	1
by	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
which	1
a	1
singular	1
chance	1
has	1
placed	1
in	1
our	1
hands.	1
Let	1
us	1
follow	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
bitter	1
end.	1
Faces	1
to	1
the	1
south,	1
then,	1
and	1
quick	1
march!"	1
	1
We	1
passed	1
across	1
Holborn,	1
down	1
Endell	1
Street,	1
and	1
so	1
through	1
a	1
zigzag	1
of	1
slums	1
to	1
Covent	1
Garden	1
Market.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
stalls	1
bore	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Breckinridge	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
proprietor	1
a	1
horsey-looking	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
face	1
and	1
trim	1
side-whiskers	1
was	1
helping	1
a	1
boy	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
the	1
shutters.	1
	1
"Good-evening.	1
It's	1
a	1
cold	1
night,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
The	1
salesman	1
nodded	1
and	1
shot	1
a	1
questioning	1
glance	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"Sold	1
out	1
of	1
geese,	1
I	1
see,"	1
continued	1
Holmes,	1
pointing	1
at	1
the	1
bare	1
slabs	1
of	1
marble.	1
	1
"Let	1
you	1
have	1
five	1
hundred	1
to-morrow	1
morning."	1
	1
"That's	1
no	1
good."	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
on	1
the	1
stall	1
with	1
the	1
gas-flare."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
recommended	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"Who	1
by?"	1
	1
"The	1
landlord	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen."	1
	1
"Fine	1
birds	1
they	1
were,	1
too.	1
Now	1
where	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
them	1
from?"	1
	1
To	1
my	1
surprise	1
the	1
question	1
provoked	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
anger	1
from	1
the	1
salesman.	1
	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
mister,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
cocked	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
akimbo,	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
driving	1
at?	1
Let's	1
have	1
it	1
straight,	1
now."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
straight	1
enough.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
sold	1
you	1
the	1
geese	1
which	1
you	1
supplied	1
to	1
the	1
Alpha."	1
	1
"Well	1
then,	1
I	1
shan't	1
tell	1
you.	1
So	1
now!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
importance;	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
warm	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
trifle."	1
	1
"Warm!	1
You'd	1
be	1
as	1
warm,	1
maybe,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
as	1
pestered	1
as	1
I	1
am.	1
When	1
I	1
pay	1
good	1
money	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
article	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
business;	1
but	1
it's	1
'Where	1
are	1
the	1
geese?'	1
and	1
'Who	1
did	1
you	1
sell	1
the	1
geese	1
to?'	1
and	1
'What	1
will	1
you	1
take	1
for	1
the	1
geese?'	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
geese	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
fuss	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
over	1
them."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
inquiries,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
carelessly.	1
"If	1
you	1
won't	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
bet	1
is	1
off,	1
that	1
is	1
all.	1
But	1
I'm	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
back	1
my	1
opinion	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fowls,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
fiver	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
bird	1
I	1
ate	1
is	1
country	1
bred."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you've	1
lost	1
your	1
fiver,	1
for	1
it's	1
town	1
bred,"	1
snapped	1
the	1
salesman.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind."	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
believe	1
it."	1
	1
"D'you	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
fowls	1
than	1
I,	1
who	1
have	1
handled	1
them	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
nipper?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
all	1
those	1
birds	1
that	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Alpha	1
were	1
town	1
bred."	1
	1
"You'll	1
never	1
persuade	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that."	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
bet,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It's	1
merely	1
taking	1
your	1
money,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
right.	1
But	1
I'll	1
have	1
a	1
sovereign	1
on	1
with	1
you,	1
just	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
obstinate."	1
	1
The	1
salesman	1
chuckled	1
grimly.	1
"Bring	1
me	1
the	1
books,	1
Bill,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
small	1
boy	1
brought	1
round	1
a	1
small	1
thin	1
volume	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
greasy-backed	1
one,	1
laying	1
them	1
out	1
together	1
beneath	1
the	1
hanging	1
lamp.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Mr.	1
Cocksure,"	1
said	1
the	1
salesman,	1
"I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
geese,	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
finish	1
you'll	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
one	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
shop.	1
You	1
see	1
this	1
little	1
book?"	1
	1
"Well?"	1
	1
"That's	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
folk	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
buy.	1
D'you	1
see?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
page	1
are	1
the	1
country	1
folk,	1
and	1
the	1
numbers	1
after	1
their	1
names	1
are	1
where	1
their	1
accounts	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
big	1
ledger.	1
Now,	1
then!	1
You	1
see	1
this	1
other	1
page	1
in	1
red	1
ink?	1
Well,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
my	1
town	1
suppliers.	1
Now,	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
third	1
name.	1
Just	1
read	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
117,	1
Brixton	1
Road--249,"	1
read	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Now	1
turn	1
that	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
ledger."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
page	1
indicated.	1
"Here	1
you	1
are,	1
'Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
117,	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
egg	1
and	1
poultry	1
supplier.'"	1
	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
what's	1
the	1
last	1
entry?"	1
	1
"'December	1
22nd.	1
Twenty-four	1
geese	1
at	1
7s.	1
6d.'"	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
There	1
you	1
are.	1
And	1
underneath?"	1
	1
"'Sold	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Windigate	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha,	1
at	1
12s.'"	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
now?"	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
looked	1
deeply	1
chagrined.	1
He	1
drew	1
a	1
sovereign	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
slab,	1
turning	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
disgust	1
is	1
too	1
deep	1
for	1
words.	1
A	1
few	1
yards	1
off	1
he	1
stopped	1
under	1
a	1
lamp-post	1
and	1
laughed	1
in	1
the	1
hearty,	1
noiseless	1
fashion	1
which	1
was	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
whiskers	1
of	1
that	1
cut	1
and	1
the	1
'Pink	1
'un'	1
protruding	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
you	1
can	1
always	1
draw	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
bet,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
daresay	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
100	1
pounds	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
such	1
complete	1
information	1
as	1
was	1
drawn	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
me	1
on	1
a	1
wager.	1
Well,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
are,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
nearing	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
our	1
quest,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
point	1
which	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
is	1
whether	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
this	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
to-night,	1
or	1
whether	1
we	1
should	1
reserve	1
it	1
for	1
to-morrow.	1
It	1
is	1
clear	1
from	1
what	1
that	1
surly	1
fellow	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
besides	1
ourselves	1
who	1
are	1
anxious	1
about	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
I	1
should--"	1
	1
His	1
remarks	1
were	1
suddenly	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
a	1
loud	1
hubbub	1
which	1
broke	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
stall	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
left.	1
Turning	1
round	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
little	1
rat-faced	1
fellow	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
which	1
was	1
thrown	1
by	1
the	1
swinging	1
lamp,	1
while	1
Breckinridge,	1
the	1
salesman,	1
framed	1
in	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
stall,	1
was	1
shaking	1
his	1
fists	1
fiercely	1
at	1
the	1
cringing	1
figure.	1
	1
"I've	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
geese,"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
devil	1
together.	1
If	1
you	1
come	1
pestering	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
your	1
silly	1
talk	1
I'll	1
set	1
the	1
dog	1
at	1
you.	1
You	1
bring	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
here	1
and	1
I'll	1
answer	1
her,	1
but	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?	1
Did	1
I	1
buy	1
the	1
geese	1
off	1
you?"	1
	1
"No;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
mine	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
whined	1
the	1
little	1
man.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
ask	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
"She	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
can	1
ask	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Proosia,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
care.	1
I've	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
it.	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
this!"	1
He	1
rushed	1
fiercely	1
forward,	1
and	1
the	1
inquirer	1
flitted	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
this	1
may	1
save	1
us	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Brixton	1
Road,"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
"Come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
this	1
fellow."	1
Striding	1
through	1
the	1
scattered	1
knots	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
lounged	1
round	1
the	1
flaring	1
stalls,	1
my	1
companion	1
speedily	1
overtook	1
the	1
little	1
man	1
and	1
touched	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
He	1
sprang	1
round,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
gas-light	1
that	1
every	1
vestige	1
of	1
colour	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
you,	1
then?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?"	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
quavering	1
voice.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly,	1
"but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
overhearing	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
you	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
salesman	1
just	1
now.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
assistance	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"You?	1
Who	1
are	1
you?	1
How	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
business	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
other	1
people	1
don't	1
know."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
can	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
this?"	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
I	1
know	1
everything	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
trace	1
some	1
geese	1
which	1
were	1
sold	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Oakshott,	1
of	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
to	1
a	1
salesman	1
named	1
Breckinridge,	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
turn	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Windigate,	1
of	1
the	1
Alpha,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
club,	1
of	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Henry	1
Baker	1
is	1
a	1
member."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
sir,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
man	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
longed	1
to	1
meet,"	1
cried	1
the	1
little	1
fellow	1
with	1
outstretched	1
hands	1
and	1
quivering	1
fingers.	1
"I	1
can	1
hardly	1
explain	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
interested	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
hailed	1
a	1
four-wheeler	1
which	1
was	1
passing.	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
discuss	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
cosy	1
room	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
this	1
wind-swept	1
market-place,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"But	1
pray	1
tell	1
me,	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
farther,	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
assisting."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
hesitated	1
for	1
an	1
instant.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
John	1
Robinson,"	1
he	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
sidelong	1
glance.	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
the	1
real	1
name,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
sweetly.	1
"It	1
is	1
always	1
awkward	1
doing	1
business	1
with	1
an	1
alias."	1
	1
A	1
flush	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
white	1
cheeks	1
of	1
the	1
stranger.	1
"Well	1
then,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"my	1
real	1
name	1
is	1
James	1
Ryder."	1
	1
"Precisely	1
so.	1
Head	1
attendant	1
at	1
the	1
Hotel	1
Cosmopolitan.	1
Pray	1
step	1
into	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
everything	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
little	1
man	1
stood	1
glancing	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us	1
with	1
half-frightened,	1
half-hopeful	1
eyes,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
sure	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
windfall	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
catastrophe.	1
Then	1
he	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
cab,	1
and	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
we	1
were	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sitting-room	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Nothing	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
during	1
our	1
drive,	1
but	1
the	1
high,	1
thin	1
breathing	1
of	1
our	1
new	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
claspings	1
and	1
unclaspings	1
of	1
his	1
hands,	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
nervous	1
tension	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
"Here	1
we	1
are!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
cheerily	1
as	1
we	1
filed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
"The	1
fire	1
looks	1
very	1
seasonable	1
in	1
this	1
weather.	1
You	1
look	1
cold,	1
Mr.	1
Ryder.	1
Pray	1
take	1
the	1
basket-chair.	1
I	1
will	1
just	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
slippers	1
before	1
we	1
settle	1
this	1
little	1
matter	1
of	1
yours.	1
Now,	1
then!	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
those	1
geese?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"Or	1
rather,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
of	1
that	1
goose.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
bird,	1
I	1
imagine	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
were	1
interested--white,	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
bar	1
across	1
the	1
tail."	1
	1
Ryder	1
quivered	1
with	1
emotion.	1
"Oh,	1
sir,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
it	1
went	1
to?"	1
	1
"It	1
came	1
here."	1
	1
"Here?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
remarkable	1
bird	1
it	1
proved.	1
I	1
don't	1
wonder	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
laid	1
an	1
egg	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
dead--the	1
bonniest,	1
brightest	1
little	1
blue	1
egg	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
seen.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
museum."	1
	1
Our	1
visitor	1
staggered	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
clutched	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand.	1
Holmes	1
unlocked	1
his	1
strong-box	1
and	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle,	1
which	1
shone	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
star,	1
with	1
a	1
cold,	1
brilliant,	1
many-pointed	1
radiance.	1
Ryder	1
stood	1
glaring	1
with	1
a	1
drawn	1
face,	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
to	1
claim	1
or	1
to	1
disown	1
it.	1
	1
"The	1
game's	1
up,	1
Ryder,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
"Hold	1
up,	1
man,	1
or	1
you'll	1
be	1
into	1
the	1
fire!	1
Give	1
him	1
an	1
arm	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
chair,	1
Watson.	1
He's	1
not	1
got	1
blood	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
for	1
felony	1
with	1
impunity.	1
Give	1
him	1
a	1
dash	1
of	1
brandy.	1
So!	1
Now	1
he	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
human.	1
What	1
a	1
shrimp	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!"	1
	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
had	1
staggered	1
and	1
nearly	1
fallen,	1
but	1
the	1
brandy	1
brought	1
a	1
tinge	1
of	1
colour	1
into	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
staring	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes	1
at	1
his	1
accuser.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
almost	1
every	1
link	1
in	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proofs	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
possibly	1
need,	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
which	1
you	1
need	1
tell	1
me.	1
Still,	1
that	1
little	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
cleared	1
up	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
case	1
complete.	1
You	1
had	1
heard,	1
Ryder,	1
of	1
this	1
blue	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
of	1
Morcar's?"	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
Catherine	1
Cusack	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
it,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
crackling	1
voice.	1
	1
"I	1
see--her	1
ladyship's	1
waiting-maid.	1
Well,	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
sudden	1
wealth	1
so	1
easily	1
acquired	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
better	1
men	1
before	1
you;	1
but	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
scrupulous	1
in	1
the	1
means	1
you	1
used.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Ryder,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
villain	1
in	1
you.	1
You	1
knew	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
Horner,	1
the	1
plumber,	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
matter	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
suspicion	1
would	1
rest	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
upon	1
him.	1
What	1
did	1
you	1
do,	1
then?	1
You	1
made	1
some	1
small	1
job	1
in	1
my	1
lady's	1
room--you	1
and	1
your	1
confederate	1
Cusack--and	1
you	1
managed	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
man	1
sent	1
for.	1
Then,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
left,	1
you	1
rifled	1
the	1
jewel-case,	1
raised	1
the	1
alarm,	1
and	1
had	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
man	1
arrested.	1
You	1
then--"	1
	1
Ryder	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
suddenly	1
upon	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
clutched	1
at	1
my	1
companion's	1
knees.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
have	1
mercy!"	1
he	1
shrieked.	1
"Think	1
of	1
my	1
father!	1
Of	1
my	1
mother!	1
It	1
would	1
break	1
their	1
hearts.	1
I	1
never	1
went	1
wrong	1
before!	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
again.	1
I	1
swear	1
it.	1
I'll	1
swear	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
Bible.	1
Oh,	1
don't	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
court!	1
For	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
don't!"	1
	1
"Get	1
back	1
into	1
your	1
chair!"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
sternly.	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
cringe	1
and	1
crawl	1
now,	1
but	1
you	1
thought	1
little	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
poor	1
Horner	1
in	1
the	1
dock	1
for	1
a	1
crime	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
fly,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
country,	1
sir.	1
Then	1
the	1
charge	1
against	1
him	1
will	1
break	1
down."	1
	1
"Hum!	1
We	1
will	1
talk	1
about	1
that.	1
And	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
a	1
true	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
act.	1
How	1
came	1
the	1
stone	1
into	1
the	1
goose,	1
and	1
how	1
came	1
the	1
goose	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
market?	1
Tell	1
us	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
there	1
lies	1
your	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
safety."	1
	1
Ryder	1
passed	1
his	1
tongue	1
over	1
his	1
parched	1
lips.	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"When	1
Horner	1
had	1
been	1
arrested,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
stone	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
what	1
moment	1
the	1
police	1
might	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
search	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
room.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
about	1
the	1
hotel	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safe.	1
I	1
went	1
out,	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
some	1
commission,	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
for	1
my	1
sister's	1
house.	1
She	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Oakshott,	1
and	1
lived	1
in	1
Brixton	1
Road,	1
where	1
she	1
fattened	1
fowls	1
for	1
the	1
market.	1
All	1
the	1
way	1
there	1
every	1
man	1
I	1
met	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
policeman	1
or	1
a	1
detective;	1
and,	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cold	1
night,	1
the	1
sweat	1
was	1
pouring	1
down	1
my	1
face	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Brixton	1
Road.	1
My	1
sister	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
pale;	1
but	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
upset	1
by	1
the	1
jewel	1
robbery	1
at	1
the	1
hotel.	1
Then	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
yard	1
and	1
smoked	1
a	1
pipe	1
and	1
wondered	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
a	1
friend	1
once	1
called	1
Maudsley,	1
who	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bad,	1
and	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
serving	1
his	1
time	1
in	1
Pentonville.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
me,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
thieves,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
stole.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
things	1
about	1
him;	1
so	1
I	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
right	1
on	1
to	1
Kilburn,	1
where	1
he	1
lived,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
confidence.	1
He	1
would	1
show	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
stone	1
into	1
money.	1
But	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
safety?	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
agonies	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
in	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
hotel.	1
I	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
be	1
seized	1
and	1
searched,	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
stone	1
in	1
my	1
waistcoat	1
pocket.	1
I	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
geese	1
which	1
were	1
waddling	1
about	1
round	1
my	1
feet,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
an	1
idea	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
which	1
showed	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
could	1
beat	1
the	1
best	1
detective	1
that	1
ever	1
lived.	1
	1
"My	1
sister	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
some	1
weeks	1
before	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
pick	1
of	1
her	1
geese	1
for	1
a	1
Christmas	1
present,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
her	1
word.	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
my	1
goose	1
now,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
would	1
carry	1
my	1
stone	1
to	1
Kilburn.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
shed	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
behind	1
this	1
I	1
drove	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
birds--a	1
fine	1
big	1
one,	1
white,	1
with	1
a	1
barred	1
tail.	1
I	1
caught	1
it,	1
and	1
prying	1
its	1
bill	1
open,	1
I	1
thrust	1
the	1
stone	1
down	1
its	1
throat	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
my	1
finger	1
could	1
reach.	1
The	1
bird	1
gave	1
a	1
gulp,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
stone	1
pass	1
along	1
its	1
gullet	1
and	1
down	1
into	1
its	1
crop.	1
But	1
the	1
creature	1
flapped	1
and	1
struggled,	1
and	1
out	1
came	1
my	1
sister	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
As	1
I	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
brute	1
broke	1
loose	1
and	1
fluttered	1
off	1
among	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
"'Whatever	1
were	1
you	1
doing	1
with	1
that	1
bird,	1
Jem?'	1
says	1
she.	1
	1
"'Well,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
said	1
you'd	1
give	1
me	1
one	1
for	1
Christmas,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
fattest.'	1
	1
"'Oh,'	1
says	1
she,	1
'we've	1
set	1
yours	1
aside	1
for	1
you--Jem's	1
bird,	1
we	1
call	1
it.	1
It's	1
the	1
big	1
white	1
one	1
over	1
yonder.	1
There's	1
twenty-six	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
makes	1
one	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
us,	1
and	1
two	1
dozen	1
for	1
the	1
market.'	1
	1
"'Thank	1
you,	1
Maggie,'	1
says	1
I;	1
'but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
you,	1
I'd	1
rather	1
have	1
that	1
one	1
I	1
was	1
handling	1
just	1
now.'	1
	1
"'The	1
other	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
three	1
pound	1
heavier,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'and	1
we	1
fattened	1
it	1
expressly	1
for	1
you.'	1
	1
"'Never	1
mind.	1
I'll	1
have	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
I'll	1
take	1
it	1
now,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
like,'	1
said	1
she,	1
a	1
little	1
huffed.	1
'Which	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want,	1
then?'	1
	1
"'That	1
white	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
barred	1
tail,	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
flock.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
very	1
well.	1
Kill	1
it	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
with	1
you.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
carried	1
the	1
bird	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Kilburn.	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
pal	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
done,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
that	1
to.	1
He	1
laughed	1
until	1
he	1
choked,	1
and	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
knife	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
goose.	1
My	1
heart	1
turned	1
to	1
water,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
some	1
terrible	1
mistake	1
had	1
occurred.	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
bird,	1
rushed	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
sister's,	1
and	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
back	1
yard.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bird	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
there.	1
	1
"'Where	1
are	1
they	1
all,	1
Maggie?'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Gone	1
to	1
the	1
dealer's,	1
Jem.'	1
	1
"'Which	1
dealer's?'	1
	1
"'Breckinridge,	1
of	1
Covent	1
Garden.'	1
	1
"'But	1
was	1
there	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
barred	1
tail?'	1
I	1
asked,	1
'the	1
same	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
chose?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
Jem;	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
barred-tailed	1
ones,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
tell	1
them	1
apart.'	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
ran	1
off	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
my	1
feet	1
would	1
carry	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
man	1
Breckinridge;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
sold	1
the	1
lot	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
word	1
would	1
he	1
tell	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
gone.	1
You	1
heard	1
him	1
yourselves	1
to-night.	1
Well,	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
answered	1
me	1
like	1
that.	1
My	1
sister	1
thinks	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
mad.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
myself.	1
And	1
now--and	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
a	1
branded	1
thief,	1
without	1
ever	1
having	1
touched	1
the	1
wealth	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
sold	1
my	1
character.	1
God	1
help	1
me!	1
God	1
help	1
me!"	1
He	1
burst	1
into	1
convulsive	1
sobbing,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
buried	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
his	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
measured	1
tapping	1
of	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes'	1
finger-tips	1
upon	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
Then	1
my	1
friend	1
rose	1
and	1
threw	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Get	1
out!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"What,	1
sir!	1
Oh,	1
Heaven	1
bless	1
you!"	1
	1
"No	1
more	1
words.	1
Get	1
out!"	1
	1
And	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
were	1
needed.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
rush,	1
a	1
clatter	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
the	1
bang	1
of	1
a	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
crisp	1
rattle	1
of	1
running	1
footfalls	1
from	1
the	1
street.	1
	1
"After	1
all,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
reaching	1
up	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
his	1
clay	1
pipe,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
retained	1
by	1
the	1
police	1
to	1
supply	1
their	1
deficiencies.	1
If	1
Horner	1
were	1
in	1
danger	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
another	1
thing;	1
but	1
this	1
fellow	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
case	1
must	1
collapse.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
commuting	1
a	1
felony,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
saving	1
a	1
soul.	1
This	1
fellow	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
wrong	1
again;	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
terribly	1
frightened.	1
Send	1
him	1
to	1
gaol	1
now,	1
and	1
you	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
gaol-bird	1
for	1
life.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
forgiveness.	1
Chance	1
has	1
put	1
in	1
our	1
way	1
a	1
most	1
singular	1
and	1
whimsical	1
problem,	1
and	1
its	1
solution	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
reward.	1
If	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
bell,	1
Doctor,	1
we	1
will	1
begin	1
another	1
investigation,	1
in	1
which,	1
also	1
a	1
bird	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
feature."	1
	1
	1
	1
VIII.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
SPECKLED	1
BAND	1
	1
On	1
glancing	1
over	1
my	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
seventy	1
odd	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
eight	1
years	1
studied	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
find	1
many	1
tragic,	1
some	1
comic,	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
merely	1
strange,	1
but	1
none	1
commonplace;	1
for,	1
working	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
rather	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
art	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
acquirement	1
of	1
wealth,	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
associate	1
himself	1
with	1
any	1
investigation	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
tend	1
towards	1
the	1
unusual,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
fantastic.	1
Of	1
all	1
these	1
varied	1
cases,	1
however,	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
any	1
which	1
presented	1
more	1
singular	1
features	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
well-known	1
Surrey	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Roylotts	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
The	1
events	1
in	1
question	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
association	1
with	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
sharing	1
rooms	1
as	1
bachelors	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
placed	1
them	1
upon	1
record	1
before,	1
but	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
was	1
made	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
freed	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
month	1
by	1
the	1
untimely	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
pledge	1
was	1
given.	1
It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
as	1
well	1
that	1
the	1
facts	1
should	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
light,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
reasons	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
widespread	1
rumours	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
which	1
tend	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
matter	1
even	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
early	1
in	1
April	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
'83	1
that	1
I	1
woke	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
find	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
standing,	1
fully	1
dressed,	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
my	1
bed.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
late	1
riser,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
showed	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
quarter-past	1
seven,	1
I	1
blinked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
some	1
surprise,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
resentment,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
myself	1
regular	1
in	1
my	1
habits.	1
	1
"Very	1
sorry	1
to	1
knock	1
you	1
up,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
it's	1
the	1
common	1
lot	1
this	1
morning.	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
has	1
been	1
knocked	1
up,	1
she	1
retorted	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
on	1
you."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
then--a	1
fire?"	1
	1
"No;	1
a	1
client.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
has	1
arrived	1
in	1
a	1
considerable	1
state	1
of	1
excitement,	1
who	1
insists	1
upon	1
seeing	1
me.	1
She	1
is	1
waiting	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
Now,	1
when	1
young	1
ladies	1
wander	1
about	1
the	1
metropolis	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
knock	1
sleepy	1
people	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
beds,	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
pressing	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
communicate.	1
Should	1
it	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
interesting	1
case,	1
you	1
would,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
wish	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
outset.	1
I	1
thought,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
call	1
you	1
and	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
chance."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
miss	1
it	1
for	1
anything."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
keener	1
pleasure	1
than	1
in	1
following	1
Holmes	1
in	1
his	1
professional	1
investigations,	1
and	1
in	1
admiring	1
the	1
rapid	1
deductions,	1
as	1
swift	1
as	1
intuitions,	1
and	1
yet	1
always	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
logical	1
basis	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
unravelled	1
the	1
problems	1
which	1
were	1
submitted	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
rapidly	1
threw	1
on	1
my	1
clothes	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
to	1
accompany	1
my	1
friend	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sitting-room.	1
A	1
lady	1
dressed	1
in	1
black	1
and	1
heavily	1
veiled,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
rose	1
as	1
we	1
entered.	1
	1
"Good-morning,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
cheerily.	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
intimate	1
friend	1
and	1
associate,	1
Dr.	1
Watson,	1
before	1
whom	1
you	1
can	1
speak	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
before	1
myself.	1
Ha!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Hudson	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
fire.	1
Pray	1
draw	1
up	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
order	1
you	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
hot	1
coffee,	1
for	1
I	1
observe	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
shivering."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
cold	1
which	1
makes	1
me	1
shiver,"	1
said	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
changing	1
her	1
seat	1
as	1
requested.	1
	1
"What,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
fear,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
It	1
is	1
terror."	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
veil	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
and	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
indeed	1
in	1
a	1
pitiable	1
state	1
of	1
agitation,	1
her	1
face	1
all	1
drawn	1
and	1
grey,	1
with	1
restless	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
hunted	1
animal.	1
Her	1
features	1
and	1
figure	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
thirty,	1
but	1
her	1
hair	1
was	1
shot	1
with	1
premature	1
grey,	1
and	1
her	1
expression	1
was	1
weary	1
and	1
haggard.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
ran	1
her	1
over	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
quick,	1
all-comprehensive	1
glances.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
fear,"	1
said	1
he	1
soothingly,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
patting	1
her	1
forearm.	1
"We	1
shall	1
soon	1
set	1
matters	1
right,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt.	1
You	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
by	1
train	1
this	1
morning,	1
I	1
see."	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
me,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
observe	1
the	1
second	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
return	1
ticket	1
in	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
your	1
left	1
glove.	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
started	1
early,	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
drive	1
in	1
a	1
dog-cart,	1
along	1
heavy	1
roads,	1
before	1
you	1
reached	1
the	1
station."	1
	1
The	1
lady	1
gave	1
a	1
violent	1
start	1
and	1
stared	1
in	1
bewilderment	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
mystery,	1
my	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling.	1
"The	1
left	1
arm	1
of	1
your	1
jacket	1
is	1
spattered	1
with	1
mud	1
in	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
seven	1
places.	1
The	1
marks	1
are	1
perfectly	1
fresh.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
vehicle	1
save	1
a	1
dog-cart	1
which	1
throws	1
up	1
mud	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
then	1
only	1
when	1
you	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
driver."	1
	1
"Whatever	1
your	1
reasons	1
may	1
be,	1
you	1
are	1
perfectly	1
correct,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
started	1
from	1
home	1
before	1
six,	1
reached	1
Leatherhead	1
at	1
twenty	1
past,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
train	1
to	1
Waterloo.	1
Sir,	1
I	1
can	1
stand	1
this	1
strain	1
no	1
longer;	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
mad	1
if	1
it	1
continues.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
turn	1
to--none,	1
save	1
only	1
one,	1
who	1
cares	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
he,	1
poor	1
fellow,	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
aid.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Farintosh,	1
whom	1
you	1
helped	1
in	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
her	1
sore	1
need.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
your	1
address.	1
Oh,	1
sir,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
help	1
me,	1
too,	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
throw	1
a	1
little	1
light	1
through	1
the	1
dense	1
darkness	1
which	1
surrounds	1
me?	1
At	1
present	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
reward	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
services,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
or	1
six	1
weeks	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
married,	1
with	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
income,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
ungrateful."	1
	1
Holmes	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
desk	1
and,	1
unlocking	1
it,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
case-book,	1
which	1
he	1
consulted.	1
	1
"Farintosh,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
I	1
recall	1
the	1
case;	1
it	1
was	1
concerned	1
with	1
an	1
opal	1
tiara.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
before	1
your	1
time,	1
Watson.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say,	1
madam,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
devote	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
to	1
your	1
case	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
friend.	1
As	1
to	1
reward,	1
my	1
profession	1
is	1
its	1
own	1
reward;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
defray	1
whatever	1
expenses	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
to,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
suits	1
you	1
best.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
lay	1
before	1
us	1
everything	1
that	1
may	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
forming	1
an	1
opinion	1
upon	1
the	1
matter."	1
	1
"Alas!"	1
replied	1
our	1
visitor,	1
"the	1
very	1
horror	1
of	1
my	1
situation	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
my	1
fears	1
are	1
so	1
vague,	1
and	1
my	1
suspicions	1
depend	1
so	1
entirely	1
upon	1
small	1
points,	1
which	1
might	1
seem	1
trivial	1
to	1
another,	1
that	1
even	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
advice	1
looks	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
him	1
about	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
fancies	1
of	1
a	1
nervous	1
woman.	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
say	1
so,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
read	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
soothing	1
answers	1
and	1
averted	1
eyes.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
manifold	1
wickedness	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart.	1
You	1
may	1
advise	1
me	1
how	1
to	1
walk	1
amid	1
the	1
dangers	1
which	1
encompass	1
me."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
all	1
attention,	1
madam."	1
	1
"My	1
name	1
is	1
Helen	1
Stoner,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
living	1
with	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
survivor	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oldest	1
Saxon	1
families	1
in	1
England,	1
the	1
Roylotts	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran,	1
on	1
the	1
western	1
border	1
of	1
Surrey."	1
	1
Holmes	1
nodded	1
his	1
head.	1
"The	1
name	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"The	1
family	1
was	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
among	1
the	1
richest	1
in	1
England,	1
and	1
the	1
estates	1
extended	1
over	1
the	1
borders	1
into	1
Berkshire	1
in	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
Hampshire	1
in	1
the	1
west.	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
century,	1
however,	1
four	1
successive	1
heirs	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
dissolute	1
and	1
wasteful	1
disposition,	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
ruin	1
was	1
eventually	1
completed	1
by	1
a	1
gambler	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Regency.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
left	1
save	1
a	1
few	1
acres	1
of	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
two-hundred-year-old	1
house,	1
which	1
is	1
itself	1
crushed	1
under	1
a	1
heavy	1
mortgage.	1
The	1
last	1
squire	1
dragged	1
out	1
his	1
existence	1
there,	1
living	1
the	1
horrible	1
life	1
of	1
an	1
aristocratic	1
pauper;	1
but	1
his	1
only	1
son,	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
adapt	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
conditions,	1
obtained	1
an	1
advance	1
from	1
a	1
relative,	1
which	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
medical	1
degree	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
Calcutta,	1
where,	1
by	1
his	1
professional	1
skill	1
and	1
his	1
force	1
of	1
character,	1
he	1
established	1
a	1
large	1
practice.	1
In	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
anger,	1
however,	1
caused	1
by	1
some	1
robberies	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
perpetrated	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
beat	1
his	1
native	1
butler	1
to	1
death	1
and	1
narrowly	1
escaped	1
a	1
capital	1
sentence.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
suffered	1
a	1
long	1
term	1
of	1
imprisonment	1
and	1
afterwards	1
returned	1
to	1
England	1
a	1
morose	1
and	1
disappointed	1
man.	1
	1
"When	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
was	1
in	1
India	1
he	1
married	1
my	1
mother,	1
Mrs.	1
Stoner,	1
the	1
young	1
widow	1
of	1
Major-General	1
Stoner,	1
of	1
the	1
Bengal	1
Artillery.	1
My	1
sister	1
Julia	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
twins,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
only	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
re-marriage.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
sum	1
of	1
money--not	1
less	1
than	1
1000	1
pounds	1
a	1
year--and	1
this	1
she	1
bequeathed	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
entirely	1
while	1
we	1
resided	1
with	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
provision	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
annual	1
sum	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
our	1
marriage.	1
Shortly	1
after	1
our	1
return	1
to	1
England	1
my	1
mother	1
died--she	1
was	1
killed	1
eight	1
years	1
ago	1
in	1
a	1
railway	1
accident	1
near	1
Crewe.	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
then	1
abandoned	1
his	1
attempts	1
to	1
establish	1
himself	1
in	1
practice	1
in	1
London	1
and	1
took	1
us	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
ancestral	1
house	1
at	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
The	1
money	1
which	1
my	1
mother	1
had	1
left	1
was	1
enough	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
wants,	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
obstacle	1
to	1
our	1
happiness.	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
terrible	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
our	1
stepfather	1
about	1
this	1
time.	1
Instead	1
of	1
making	1
friends	1
and	1
exchanging	1
visits	1
with	1
our	1
neighbours,	1
who	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
been	1
overjoyed	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
Roylott	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
family	1
seat,	1
he	1
shut	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
seldom	1
came	1
out	1
save	1
to	1
indulge	1
in	1
ferocious	1
quarrels	1
with	1
whoever	1
might	1
cross	1
his	1
path.	1
Violence	1
of	1
temper	1
approaching	1
to	1
mania	1
has	1
been	1
hereditary	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
stepfather's	1
case	1
it	1
had,	1
I	1
believe,	1
been	1
intensified	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
residence	1
in	1
the	1
tropics.	1
A	1
series	1
of	1
disgraceful	1
brawls	1
took	1
place,	1
two	1
of	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
police-court,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
the	1
folks	1
would	1
fly	1
at	1
his	1
approach,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
immense	1
strength,	1
and	1
absolutely	1
uncontrollable	1
in	1
his	1
anger.	1
	1
"Last	1
week	1
he	1
hurled	1
the	1
local	1
blacksmith	1
over	1
a	1
parapet	1
into	1
a	1
stream,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
by	1
paying	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
gather	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
avert	1
another	1
public	1
exposure.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
friends	1
at	1
all	1
save	1
the	1
wandering	1
gipsies,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
these	1
vagabonds	1
leave	1
to	1
encamp	1
upon	1
the	1
few	1
acres	1
of	1
bramble-covered	1
land	1
which	1
represent	1
the	1
family	1
estate,	1
and	1
would	1
accept	1
in	1
return	1
the	1
hospitality	1
of	1
their	1
tents,	1
wandering	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
sometimes	1
for	1
weeks	1
on	1
end.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
passion	1
also	1
for	1
Indian	1
animals,	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
correspondent,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon,	1
which	1
wander	1
freely	1
over	1
his	1
grounds	1
and	1
are	1
feared	1
by	1
the	1
villagers	1
almost	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
their	1
master.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
imagine	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
my	1
poor	1
sister	1
Julia	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
our	1
lives.	1
No	1
servant	1
would	1
stay	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
we	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
She	1
was	1
but	1
thirty	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death,	1
and	1
yet	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
whiten,	1
even	1
as	1
mine	1
has."	1
	1
"Your	1
sister	1
is	1
dead,	1
then?"	1
	1
"She	1
died	1
just	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you.	1
You	1
can	1
understand	1
that,	1
living	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
we	1
were	1
little	1
likely	1
to	1
see	1
anyone	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
age	1
and	1
position.	1
We	1
had,	1
however,	1
an	1
aunt,	1
my	1
mother's	1
maiden	1
sister,	1
Miss	1
Honoria	1
Westphail,	1
who	1
lives	1
near	1
Harrow,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
occasionally	1
allowed	1
to	1
pay	1
short	1
visits	1
at	1
this	1
lady's	1
house.	1
Julia	1
went	1
there	1
at	1
Christmas	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
met	1
there	1
a	1
half-pay	1
major	1
of	1
marines,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
became	1
engaged.	1
My	1
stepfather	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
engagement	1
when	1
my	1
sister	1
returned	1
and	1
offered	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
marriage;	1
but	1
within	1
a	1
fortnight	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
wedding,	1
the	1
terrible	1
event	1
occurred	1
which	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
only	1
companion."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
sunk	1
in	1
a	1
cushion,	1
but	1
he	1
half	1
opened	1
his	1
lids	1
now	1
and	1
glanced	1
across	1
at	1
his	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Pray	1
be	1
precise	1
as	1
to	1
details,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
easy	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
for	1
every	1
event	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
time	1
is	1
seared	1
into	1
my	1
memory.	1
The	1
manor-house	1
is,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
very	1
old,	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
wing	1
is	1
now	1
inhabited.	1
The	1
bedrooms	1
in	1
this	1
wing	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
the	1
sitting-rooms	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
central	1
block	1
of	1
the	1
buildings.	1
Of	1
these	1
bedrooms	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's,	1
the	1
second	1
my	1
sister's,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
my	1
own.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
communication	1
between	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
open	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
corridor.	1
Do	1
I	1
make	1
myself	1
plain?"	1
	1
"Perfectly	1
so."	1
	1
"The	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
rooms	1
open	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
lawn.	1
That	1
fatal	1
night	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
early,	1
though	1
we	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
retired	1
to	1
rest,	1
for	1
my	1
sister	1
was	1
troubled	1
by	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
strong	1
Indian	1
cigars	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
to	1
smoke.	1
She	1
left	1
her	1
room,	1
therefore,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
mine,	1
where	1
she	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
chatting	1
about	1
her	1
approaching	1
wedding.	1
At	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
leave	1
me,	1
but	1
she	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
looked	1
back.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me,	1
Helen,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'have	1
you	1
ever	1
heard	1
anyone	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
night?'	1
	1
"'Never,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'I	1
suppose	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
whistle,	1
yourself,	1
in	1
your	1
sleep?'	1
	1
"'Certainly	1
not.	1
But	1
why?'	1
	1
"'Because	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
nights	1
I	1
have	1
always,	1
about	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
heard	1
a	1
low,	1
clear	1
whistle.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
light	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
awakened	1
me.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
where	1
it	1
came	1
from--perhaps	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room,	1
perhaps	1
from	1
the	1
lawn.	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
just	1
ask	1
you	1
whether	1
you	1
had	1
heard	1
it.'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
have	1
not.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
those	1
wretched	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
likely.	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
lawn,	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
it	1
also.'	1
	1
"'Ah,	1
but	1
I	1
sleep	1
more	1
heavily	1
than	1
you.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
great	1
consequence,	1
at	1
any	1
rate.'	1
She	1
smiled	1
back	1
at	1
me,	1
closed	1
my	1
door,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
key	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
lock."	1
	1
"Indeed,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Was	1
it	1
your	1
custom	1
always	1
to	1
lock	1
yourselves	1
in	1
at	1
night?"	1
	1
"Always."	1
	1
"And	1
why?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
kept	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon.	1
We	1
had	1
no	1
feeling	1
of	1
security	1
unless	1
our	1
doors	1
were	1
locked."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Pray	1
proceed	1
with	1
your	1
statement."	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
that	1
night.	1
A	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
impending	1
misfortune	1
impressed	1
me.	1
My	1
sister	1
and	1
I,	1
you	1
will	1
recollect,	1
were	1
twins,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
subtle	1
are	1
the	1
links	1
which	1
bind	1
two	1
souls	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
closely	1
allied.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
night.	1
The	1
wind	1
was	1
howling	1
outside,	1
and	1
the	1
rain	1
was	1
beating	1
and	1
splashing	1
against	1
the	1
windows.	1
Suddenly,	1
amid	1
all	1
the	1
hubbub	1
of	1
the	1
gale,	1
there	1
burst	1
forth	1
the	1
wild	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
terrified	1
woman.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
sister's	1
voice.	1
I	1
sprang	1
from	1
my	1
bed,	1
wrapped	1
a	1
shawl	1
round	1
me,	1
and	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
corridor.	1
As	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
door	1
I	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
low	1
whistle,	1
such	1
as	1
my	1
sister	1
described,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
a	1
clanging	1
sound,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
metal	1
had	1
fallen.	1
As	1
I	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
passage,	1
my	1
sister's	1
door	1
was	1
unlocked,	1
and	1
revolved	1
slowly	1
upon	1
its	1
hinges.	1
I	1
stared	1
at	1
it	1
horror-stricken,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
issue	1
from	1
it.	1
By	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
corridor-lamp	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
sister	1
appear	1
at	1
the	1
opening,	1
her	1
face	1
blanched	1
with	1
terror,	1
her	1
hands	1
groping	1
for	1
help,	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
swaying	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard.	1
I	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
threw	1
my	1
arms	1
round	1
her,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
her	1
knees	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
and	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
She	1
writhed	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
terrible	1
pain,	1
and	1
her	1
limbs	1
were	1
dreadfully	1
convulsed.	1
At	1
first	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
recognised	1
me,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
she	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget,	1
'Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
Helen!	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
band!	1
The	1
speckled	1
band!'	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
else	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
she	1
stabbed	1
with	1
her	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
room,	1
but	1
a	1
fresh	1
convulsion	1
seized	1
her	1
and	1
choked	1
her	1
words.	1
I	1
rushed	1
out,	1
calling	1
loudly	1
for	1
my	1
stepfather,	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
him	1
hastening	1
from	1
his	1
room	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-gown.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
my	1
sister's	1
side	1
she	1
was	1
unconscious,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
poured	1
brandy	1
down	1
her	1
throat	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
medical	1
aid	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
all	1
efforts	1
were	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
she	1
slowly	1
sank	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
having	1
recovered	1
her	1
consciousness.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
dreadful	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
sister."	1
	1
"One	1
moment,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"are	1
you	1
sure	1
about	1
this	1
whistle	1
and	1
metallic	1
sound?	1
Could	1
you	1
swear	1
to	1
it?"	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
county	1
coroner	1
asked	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
inquiry.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
strong	1
impression	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
yet,	1
among	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
gale	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
house,	1
I	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
been	1
deceived."	1
	1
"Was	1
your	1
sister	1
dressed?"	1
	1
"No,	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
night-dress.	1
In	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
found	1
the	1
charred	1
stump	1
of	1
a	1
match,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
left	1
a	1
match-box."	1
	1
"Showing	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
struck	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
when	1
the	1
alarm	1
took	1
place.	1
That	1
is	1
important.	1
And	1
what	1
conclusions	1
did	1
the	1
coroner	1
come	1
to?"	1
	1
"He	1
investigated	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
great	1
care,	1
for	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
conduct	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
notorious	1
in	1
the	1
county,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
cause	1
of	1
death.	1
My	1
evidence	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
had	1
been	1
fastened	1
upon	1
the	1
inner	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
blocked	1
by	1
old-fashioned	1
shutters	1
with	1
broad	1
iron	1
bars,	1
which	1
were	1
secured	1
every	1
night.	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
carefully	1
sounded,	1
and	1
were	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
solid	1
all	1
round,	1
and	1
the	1
flooring	1
was	1
also	1
thoroughly	1
examined,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
result.	1
The	1
chimney	1
is	1
wide,	1
but	1
is	1
barred	1
up	1
by	1
four	1
large	1
staples.	1
It	1
is	1
certain,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
was	1
quite	1
alone	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
end.	1
Besides,	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
marks	1
of	1
any	1
violence	1
upon	1
her."	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
poison?"	1
	1
"The	1
doctors	1
examined	1
her	1
for	1
it,	1
but	1
without	1
success."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
lady	1
died	1
of,	1
then?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
she	1
died	1
of	1
pure	1
fear	1
and	1
nervous	1
shock,	1
though	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
frightened	1
her	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"Were	1
there	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation	1
at	1
the	1
time?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
nearly	1
always	1
some	1
there."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
gather	1
from	1
this	1
allusion	1
to	1
a	1
band--a	1
speckled	1
band?"	1
	1
"Sometimes	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
wild	1
talk	1
of	1
delirium,	1
sometimes	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
referred	1
to	1
some	1
band	1
of	1
people,	1
perhaps	1
to	1
these	1
very	1
gipsies	1
in	1
the	1
plantation.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
spotted	1
handkerchiefs	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
wear	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
might	1
have	1
suggested	1
the	1
strange	1
adjective	1
which	1
she	1
used."	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
satisfied.	1
	1
"These	1
are	1
very	1
deep	1
waters,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"pray	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
narrative."	1
	1
"Two	1
years	1
have	1
passed	1
since	1
then,	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
until	1
lately	1
lonelier	1
than	1
ever.	1
A	1
month	1
ago,	1
however,	1
a	1
dear	1
friend,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
has	1
done	1
me	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
ask	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
marriage.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Armitage--Percy	1
Armitage--the	1
second	1
son	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Armitage,	1
of	1
Crane	1
Water,	1
near	1
Reading.	1
My	1
stepfather	1
has	1
offered	1
no	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
match,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
spring.	1
Two	1
days	1
ago	1
some	1
repairs	1
were	1
started	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
and	1
my	1
bedroom	1
wall	1
has	1
been	1
pierced,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
move	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
sister	1
died,	1
and	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
bed	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
slept.	1
Imagine,	1
then,	1
my	1
thrill	1
of	1
terror	1
when	1
last	1
night,	1
as	1
I	1
lay	1
awake,	1
thinking	1
over	1
her	1
terrible	1
fate,	1
I	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
low	1
whistle	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
herald	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
death.	1
I	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
lit	1
the	1
lamp,	1
but	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
shaken	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
again,	1
however,	1
so	1
I	1
dressed,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
daylight	1
I	1
slipped	1
down,	1
got	1
a	1
dog-cart	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
Inn,	1
which	1
is	1
opposite,	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
Leatherhead,	1
from	1
whence	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
on	1
this	1
morning	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
object	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
and	1
asking	1
your	1
advice."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
wisely,"	1
said	1
my	1
friend.	1
"But	1
have	1
you	1
told	1
me	1
all?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
all."	1
	1
"Miss	1
Roylott,	1
you	1
have	1
not.	1
You	1
are	1
screening	1
your	1
stepfather."	1
	1
"Why,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
For	1
answer	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
frill	1
of	1
black	1
lace	1
which	1
fringed	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
lay	1
upon	1
our	1
visitor's	1
knee.	1
Five	1
little	1
livid	1
spots,	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
four	1
fingers	1
and	1
a	1
thumb,	1
were	1
printed	1
upon	1
the	1
white	1
wrist.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
cruelly	1
used,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
The	1
lady	1
coloured	1
deeply	1
and	1
covered	1
over	1
her	1
injured	1
wrist.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
man,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
hardly	1
knows	1
his	1
own	1
strength."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence,	1
during	1
which	1
Holmes	1
leaned	1
his	1
chin	1
upon	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
stared	1
into	1
the	1
crackling	1
fire.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
business,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"There	1
are	1
a	1
thousand	1
details	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
before	1
I	1
decide	1
upon	1
our	1
course	1
of	1
action.	1
Yet	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
lose.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
to-day,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
see	1
over	1
these	1
rooms	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
stepfather?"	1
	1
"As	1
it	1
happens,	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
coming	1
into	1
town	1
to-day	1
upon	1
some	1
most	1
important	1
business.	1
It	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
away	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
disturb	1
you.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
housekeeper	1
now,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
old	1
and	1
foolish,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
get	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way."	1
	1
"Excellent.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
averse	1
to	1
this	1
trip,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"By	1
no	1
means."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
shall	1
both	1
come.	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
do	1
yourself?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
do	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
town.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
twelve	1
o'clock	1
train,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
your	1
coming."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
may	1
expect	1
us	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
I	1
have	1
myself	1
some	1
small	1
business	1
matters	1
to	1
attend	1
to.	1
Will	1
you	1
not	1
wait	1
and	1
breakfast?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
must	1
go.	1
My	1
heart	1
is	1
lightened	1
already	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
confided	1
my	1
trouble	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
seeing	1
you	1
again	1
this	1
afternoon."	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
thick	1
black	1
veil	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
glided	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
Watson?"	1
asked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
dark	1
and	1
sinister	1
business."	1
	1
"Dark	1
enough	1
and	1
sinister	1
enough."	1
	1
"Yet	1
if	1
the	1
lady	1
is	1
correct	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
flooring	1
and	1
walls	1
are	1
sound,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
door,	1
window,	1
and	1
chimney	1
are	1
impassable,	1
then	1
her	1
sister	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
undoubtedly	1
alone	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
her	1
mysterious	1
end."	1
	1
"What	1
becomes,	1
then,	1
of	1
these	1
nocturnal	1
whistles,	1
and	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
peculiar	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
woman?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
think."	1
	1
"When	1
you	1
combine	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
whistles	1
at	1
night,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
gipsies	1
who	1
are	1
on	1
intimate	1
terms	1
with	1
this	1
old	1
doctor,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
has	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
preventing	1
his	1
stepdaughter's	1
marriage,	1
the	1
dying	1
allusion	1
to	1
a	1
band,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Miss	1
Helen	1
Stoner	1
heard	1
a	1
metallic	1
clang,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
caused	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
metal	1
bars	1
that	1
secured	1
the	1
shutters	1
falling	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
place,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
good	1
ground	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
mystery	1
may	1
be	1
cleared	1
along	1
those	1
lines."	1
	1
"But	1
what,	1
then,	1
did	1
the	1
gipsies	1
do?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
many	1
objections	1
to	1
any	1
such	1
theory."	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
do	1
I.	1
It	1
is	1
precisely	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
this	1
day.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
objections	1
are	1
fatal,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
explained	1
away.	1
But	1
what	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
devil!"	1
	1
The	1
ejaculation	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
from	1
my	1
companion	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
our	1
door	1
had	1
been	1
suddenly	1
dashed	1
open,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
huge	1
man	1
had	1
framed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
aperture.	1
His	1
costume	1
was	1
a	1
peculiar	1
mixture	1
of	1
the	1
professional	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
agricultural,	1
having	1
a	1
black	1
top-hat,	1
a	1
long	1
frock-coat,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
high	1
gaiters,	1
with	1
a	1
hunting-crop	1
swinging	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
So	1
tall	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
his	1
hat	1
actually	1
brushed	1
the	1
cross	1
bar	1
of	1
the	1
doorway,	1
and	1
his	1
breadth	1
seemed	1
to	1
span	1
it	1
across	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side.	1
A	1
large	1
face,	1
seared	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
wrinkles,	1
burned	1
yellow	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
marked	1
with	1
every	1
evil	1
passion,	1
was	1
turned	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
us,	1
while	1
his	1
deep-set,	1
bile-shot	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
high,	1
thin,	1
fleshless	1
nose,	1
gave	1
him	1
somewhat	1
the	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
fierce	1
old	1
bird	1
of	1
prey.	1
	1
"Which	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
Holmes?"	1
asked	1
this	1
apparition.	1
	1
"My	1
name,	1
sir;	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
me,"	1
said	1
my	1
companion	1
quietly.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
Doctor,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
blandly.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
My	1
stepdaughter	1
has	1
been	1
here.	1
I	1
have	1
traced	1
her.	1
What	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
you?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
cold	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
year,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"What	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
you?"	1
screamed	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
furiously.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
crocuses	1
promise	1
well,"	1
continued	1
my	1
companion	1
imperturbably.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
You	1
put	1
me	1
off,	1
do	1
you?"	1
said	1
our	1
new	1
visitor,	1
taking	1
a	1
step	1
forward	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
hunting-crop.	1
"I	1
know	1
you,	1
you	1
scoundrel!	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you	1
before.	1
You	1
are	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
meddler."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Holmes,	1
the	1
busybody!"	1
	1
His	1
smile	1
broadened.	1
	1
"Holmes,	1
the	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
Jack-in-office!"	1
	1
Holmes	1
chuckled	1
heartily.	1
"Your	1
conversation	1
is	1
most	1
entertaining,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"When	1
you	1
go	1
out	1
close	1
the	1
door,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
decided	1
draught."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
my	1
say.	1
Don't	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
meddle	1
with	1
my	1
affairs.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
has	1
been	1
here.	1
I	1
traced	1
her!	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
dangerous	1
man	1
to	1
fall	1
foul	1
of!	1
See	1
here."	1
He	1
stepped	1
swiftly	1
forward,	1
seized	1
the	1
poker,	1
and	1
bent	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
curve	1
with	1
his	1
huge	1
brown	1
hands.	1
	1
"See	1
that	1
you	1
keep	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
grip,"	1
he	1
snarled,	1
and	1
hurling	1
the	1
twisted	1
poker	1
into	1
the	1
fireplace	1
he	1
strode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"He	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
amiable	1
person,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
bulky,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
that	1
my	1
grip	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
feeble	1
than	1
his	1
own."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
steel	1
poker	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
effort,	1
straightened	1
it	1
out	1
again.	1
	1
"Fancy	1
his	1
having	1
the	1
insolence	1
to	1
confound	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
official	1
detective	1
force!	1
This	1
incident	1
gives	1
zest	1
to	1
our	1
investigation,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
trust	1
that	1
our	1
little	1
friend	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
from	1
her	1
imprudence	1
in	1
allowing	1
this	1
brute	1
to	1
trace	1
her.	1
And	1
now,	1
Watson,	1
we	1
shall	1
order	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
I	1
shall	1
walk	1
down	1
to	1
Doctors'	1
Commons,	1
where	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
data	1
which	1
may	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
matter."	1
	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
one	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
returned	1
from	1
his	1
excursion.	1
He	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
blue	1
paper,	1
scrawled	1
over	1
with	1
notes	1
and	1
figures.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
deceased	1
wife,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"To	1
determine	1
its	1
exact	1
meaning	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
present	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
investments	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
concerned.	1
The	1
total	1
income,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
wife's	1
death	1
was	1
little	1
short	1
of	1
1100	1
pounds,	1
is	1
now,	1
through	1
the	1
fall	1
in	1
agricultural	1
prices,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
750	1
pounds.	1
Each	1
daughter	1
can	1
claim	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
250	1
pounds,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
marriage.	1
It	1
is	1
evident,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
if	1
both	1
girls	1
had	1
married,	1
this	1
beauty	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
mere	1
pittance,	1
while	1
even	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
cripple	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
extent.	1
My	1
morning's	1
work	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
wasted,	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
very	1
strongest	1
motives	1
for	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
And	1
now,	1
Watson,	1
this	1
is	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
dawdling,	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
aware	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
interesting	1
ourselves	1
in	1
his	1
affairs;	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
ready,	1
we	1
shall	1
call	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drive	1
to	1
Waterloo.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
slip	1
your	1
revolver	1
into	1
your	1
pocket.	1
An	1
Eley's	1
No.	1
2	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
argument	1
with	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
can	1
twist	1
steel	1
pokers	1
into	1
knots.	1
That	1
and	1
a	1
tooth-brush	1
are,	1
I	1
think,	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
need."	1
	1
At	1
Waterloo	1
we	1
were	1
fortunate	1
in	1
catching	1
a	1
train	1
for	1
Leatherhead,	1
where	1
we	1
hired	1
a	1
trap	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
inn	1
and	1
drove	1
for	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
miles	1
through	1
the	1
lovely	1
Surrey	1
lanes.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
sun	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
fleecy	1
clouds	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
The	1
trees	1
and	1
wayside	1
hedges	1
were	1
just	1
throwing	1
out	1
their	1
first	1
green	1
shoots,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
pleasant	1
smell	1
of	1
the	1
moist	1
earth.	1
To	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
contrast	1
between	1
the	1
sweet	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
and	1
this	1
sinister	1
quest	1
upon	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
engaged.	1
My	1
companion	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
trap,	1
his	1
arms	1
folded,	1
his	1
hat	1
pulled	1
down	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
his	1
chin	1
sunk	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
thought.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
he	1
started,	1
tapped	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
pointed	1
over	1
the	1
meadows.	1
	1
"Look	1
there!"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
A	1
heavily	1
timbered	1
park	1
stretched	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
gentle	1
slope,	1
thickening	1
into	1
a	1
grove	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
point.	1
From	1
amid	1
the	1
branches	1
there	1
jutted	1
out	1
the	1
grey	1
gables	1
and	1
high	1
roof-tree	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
old	1
mansion.	1
	1
"Stoke	1
Moran?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
driver.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
some	1
building	1
going	1
on	1
there,"	1
said	1
Holmes;	1
"that	1
is	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
going."	1
	1
"There's	1
the	1
village,"	1
said	1
the	1
driver,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
cluster	1
of	1
roofs	1
some	1
distance	1
to	1
the	1
left;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
you'll	1
find	1
it	1
shorter	1
to	1
get	1
over	1
this	1
stile,	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
foot-path	1
over	1
the	1
fields.	1
There	1
it	1
is,	1
where	1
the	1
lady	1
is	1
walking."	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
lady,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
is	1
Miss	1
Stoner,"	1
observed	1
Holmes,	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
suggest."	1
	1
We	1
got	1
off,	1
paid	1
our	1
fare,	1
and	1
the	1
trap	1
rattled	1
back	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
Leatherhead.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
it	1
as	1
well,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
climbed	1
the	1
stile,	1
"that	1
this	1
fellow	1
should	1
think	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
here	1
as	1
architects,	1
or	1
on	1
some	1
definite	1
business.	1
It	1
may	1
stop	1
his	1
gossip.	1
Good-afternoon,	1
Miss	1
Stoner.	1
You	1
see	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
our	1
word."	1
	1
Our	1
client	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
hurried	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
which	1
spoke	1
her	1
joy.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
so	1
eagerly	1
for	1
you,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
us	1
warmly.	1
"All	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
splendidly.	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
town,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
unlikely	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
evening."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
doctor's	1
acquaintance,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
he	1
sketched	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
turned	1
white	1
to	1
the	1
lips	1
as	1
she	1
listened.	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"he	1
has	1
followed	1
me,	1
then."	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
appears."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
so	1
cunning	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
safe	1
from	1
him.	1
What	1
will	1
he	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
returns?"	1
	1
"He	1
must	1
guard	1
himself,	1
for	1
he	1
may	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
someone	1
more	1
cunning	1
than	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
track.	1
You	1
must	1
lock	1
yourself	1
up	1
from	1
him	1
to-night.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
violent,	1
we	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
to	1
your	1
aunt's	1
at	1
Harrow.	1
Now,	1
we	1
must	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
use	1
of	1
our	1
time,	1
so	1
kindly	1
take	1
us	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
rooms	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
examine."	1
	1
The	1
building	1
was	1
of	1
grey,	1
lichen-blotched	1
stone,	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
central	1
portion	1
and	1
two	1
curving	1
wings,	1
like	1
the	1
claws	1
of	1
a	1
crab,	1
thrown	1
out	1
on	1
each	1
side.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
wings	1
the	1
windows	1
were	1
broken	1
and	1
blocked	1
with	1
wooden	1
boards,	1
while	1
the	1
roof	1
was	1
partly	1
caved	1
in,	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
ruin.	1
The	1
central	1
portion	1
was	1
in	1
little	1
better	1
repair,	1
but	1
the	1
right-hand	1
block	1
was	1
comparatively	1
modern,	1
and	1
the	1
blinds	1
in	1
the	1
windows,	1
with	1
the	1
blue	1
smoke	1
curling	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
chimneys,	1
showed	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
where	1
the	1
family	1
resided.	1
Some	1
scaffolding	1
had	1
been	1
erected	1
against	1
the	1
end	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
stone-work	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
into,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
any	1
workmen	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
our	1
visit.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
slowly	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
ill-trimmed	1
lawn	1
and	1
examined	1
with	1
deep	1
attention	1
the	1
outsides	1
of	1
the	1
windows.	1
	1
"This,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
sleep,	1
the	1
centre	1
one	1
to	1
your	1
sister's,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
building	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
chamber?"	1
	1
"Exactly	1
so.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
sleeping	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
one."	1
	1
"Pending	1
the	1
alterations,	1
as	1
I	1
understand.	1
By	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
very	1
pressing	1
need	1
for	1
repairs	1
at	1
that	1
end	1
wall."	1
	1
"There	1
were	1
none.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excuse	1
to	1
move	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
room."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
that	1
is	1
suggestive.	1
Now,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
narrow	1
wing	1
runs	1
the	1
corridor	1
from	1
which	1
these	1
three	1
rooms	1
open.	1
There	1
are	1
windows	1
in	1
it,	1
of	1
course?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
very	1
small	1
ones.	1
Too	1
narrow	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
pass	1
through."	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
both	1
locked	1
your	1
doors	1
at	1
night,	1
your	1
rooms	1
were	1
unapproachable	1
from	1
that	1
side.	1
Now,	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
your	1
room	1
and	1
bar	1
your	1
shutters?"	1
	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
Holmes,	1
after	1
a	1
careful	1
examination	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
window,	1
endeavoured	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
to	1
force	1
the	1
shutter	1
open,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
slit	1
through	1
which	1
a	1
knife	1
could	1
be	1
passed	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
bar.	1
Then	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
he	1
tested	1
the	1
hinges,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
solid	1
iron,	1
built	1
firmly	1
into	1
the	1
massive	1
masonry.	1
"Hum!"	1
said	1
he,	1
scratching	1
his	1
chin	1
in	1
some	1
perplexity,	1
"my	1
theory	1
certainly	1
presents	1
some	1
difficulties.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
pass	1
these	1
shutters	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
bolted.	1
Well,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
inside	1
throws	1
any	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
matter."	1
	1
A	1
small	1
side	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
whitewashed	1
corridor	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
three	1
bedrooms	1
opened.	1
Holmes	1
refused	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
third	1
chamber,	1
so	1
we	1
passed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
was	1
now	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
her	1
fate.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
homely	1
little	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
ceiling	1
and	1
a	1
gaping	1
fireplace,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
old	1
country-houses.	1
A	1
brown	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
stood	1
in	1
one	1
corner,	1
a	1
narrow	1
white-counterpaned	1
bed	1
in	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
dressing-table	1
on	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
These	1
articles,	1
with	1
two	1
small	1
wicker-work	1
chairs,	1
made	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
save	1
for	1
a	1
square	1
of	1
Wilton	1
carpet	1
in	1
the	1
centre.	1
The	1
boards	1
round	1
and	1
the	1
panelling	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
brown,	1
worm-eaten	1
oak,	1
so	1
old	1
and	1
discoloured	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
dated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Holmes	1
drew	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chairs	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
sat	1
silent,	1
while	1
his	1
eyes	1
travelled	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
and	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
taking	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
the	1
apartment.	1
	1
"Where	1
does	1
that	1
bell	1
communicate	1
with?"	1
he	1
asked	1
at	1
last	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
thick	1
bell-rope	1
which	1
hung	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
bed,	1
the	1
tassel	1
actually	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"It	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
room."	1
	1
"It	1
looks	1
newer	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
things?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
put	1
there	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
years	1
ago."	1
	1
"Your	1
sister	1
asked	1
for	1
it,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
using	1
it.	1
We	1
used	1
always	1
to	1
get	1
what	1
we	1
wanted	1
for	1
ourselves."	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
it	1
seemed	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
put	1
so	1
nice	1
a	1
bell-pull	1
there.	1
You	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
while	1
I	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
floor."	1
He	1
threw	1
himself	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
lens	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
crawled	1
swiftly	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
examining	1
minutely	1
the	1
cracks	1
between	1
the	1
boards.	1
Then	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
the	1
wood-work	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
chamber	1
was	1
panelled.	1
Finally	1
he	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
staring	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
in	1
running	1
his	1
eye	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
wall.	1
Finally	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
bell-rope	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
brisk	1
tug.	1
	1
"Why,	1
it's	1
a	1
dummy,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Won't	1
it	1
ring?"	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
wire.	1
This	1
is	1
very	1
interesting.	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
fastened	1
to	1
a	1
hook	1
just	1
above	1
where	1
the	1
little	1
opening	1
for	1
the	1
ventilator	1
is."	1
	1
"How	1
very	1
absurd!	1
I	1
never	1
noticed	1
that	1
before."	1
	1
"Very	1
strange!"	1
muttered	1
Holmes,	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
rope.	1
"There	1
are	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
very	1
singular	1
points	1
about	1
this	1
room.	1
For	1
example,	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
a	1
builder	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
open	1
a	1
ventilator	1
into	1
another	1
room,	1
when,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
trouble,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
communicated	1
with	1
the	1
outside	1
air!"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
also	1
quite	1
modern,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady.	1
	1
"Done	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
bell-rope?"	1
remarked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
little	1
changes	1
carried	1
out	1
about	1
that	1
time."	1
	1
"They	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
character--dummy	1
bell-ropes,	1
and	1
ventilators	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
ventilate.	1
With	1
your	1
permission,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
we	1
shall	1
now	1
carry	1
our	1
researches	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
apartment."	1
	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott's	1
chamber	1
was	1
larger	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
step-daughter,	1
but	1
was	1
as	1
plainly	1
furnished.	1
A	1
camp-bed,	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
shelf	1
full	1
of	1
books,	1
mostly	1
of	1
a	1
technical	1
character,	1
an	1
armchair	1
beside	1
the	1
bed,	1
a	1
plain	1
wooden	1
chair	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
a	1
round	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
iron	1
safe	1
were	1
the	1
principal	1
things	1
which	1
met	1
the	1
eye.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
slowly	1
round	1
and	1
examined	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
interest.	1
	1
"What's	1
in	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
tapping	1
the	1
safe.	1
	1
"My	1
stepfather's	1
business	1
papers."	1
	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
inside,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Only	1
once,	1
some	1
years	1
ago.	1
I	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
papers."	1
	1
"There	1
isn't	1
a	1
cat	1
in	1
it,	1
for	1
example?"	1
	1
"No.	1
What	1
a	1
strange	1
idea!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
look	1
at	1
this!"	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
small	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"No;	1
we	1
don't	1
keep	1
a	1
cat.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
cheetah	1
and	1
a	1
baboon."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course!	1
Well,	1
a	1
cheetah	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
big	1
cat,	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
very	1
far	1
in	1
satisfying	1
its	1
wants,	1
I	1
daresay.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
determine."	1
He	1
squatted	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
wooden	1
chair	1
and	1
examined	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
quite	1
settled,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
lens	1
in	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"Hullo!	1
Here	1
is	1
something	1
interesting!"	1
	1
The	1
object	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
dog	1
lash	1
hung	1
on	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
lash,	1
however,	1
was	1
curled	1
upon	1
itself	1
and	1
tied	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
loop	1
of	1
whipcord.	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
that,	1
Watson?"	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
common	1
enough	1
lash.	1
But	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
why	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
tied."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
common,	1
is	1
it?	1
Ah,	1
me!	1
it's	1
a	1
wicked	1
world,	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
turns	1
his	1
brains	1
to	1
crime	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
enough	1
now,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
and	1
with	1
your	1
permission	1
we	1
shall	1
walk	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
lawn."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
my	1
friend's	1
face	1
so	1
grim	1
or	1
his	1
brow	1
so	1
dark	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
when	1
we	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
this	1
investigation.	1
We	1
had	1
walked	1
several	1
times	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
lawn,	1
neither	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
nor	1
myself	1
liking	1
to	1
break	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
thoughts	1
before	1
he	1
roused	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
reverie.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
essential,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
absolutely	1
follow	1
my	1
advice	1
in	1
every	1
respect."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
most	1
certainly	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"The	1
matter	1
is	1
too	1
serious	1
for	1
any	1
hesitation.	1
Your	1
life	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
your	1
compliance."	1
	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
your	1
hands."	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
both	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
your	1
room."	1
	1
Both	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
and	1
I	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
astonishment.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
Let	1
me	1
explain.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
village	1
inn	1
over	1
there?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
Crown."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
Your	1
windows	1
would	1
be	1
visible	1
from	1
there?"	1
	1
"Certainly."	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
confine	1
yourself	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
on	1
pretence	1
of	1
a	1
headache,	1
when	1
your	1
stepfather	1
comes	1
back.	1
Then	1
when	1
you	1
hear	1
him	1
retire	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
you	1
must	1
open	1
the	1
shutters	1
of	1
your	1
window,	1
undo	1
the	1
hasp,	1
put	1
your	1
lamp	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
then	1
withdraw	1
quietly	1
with	1
everything	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
want	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
which	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
occupy.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
repairs,	1
you	1
could	1
manage	1
there	1
for	1
one	1
night."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
easily."	1
	1
"The	1
rest	1
you	1
will	1
leave	1
in	1
our	1
hands."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do?"	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
investigate	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
noise	1
which	1
has	1
disturbed	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
believe,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
made	1
up	1
your	1
mind,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
upon	1
my	1
companion's	1
sleeve.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
have."	1
	1
"Then,	1
for	1
pity's	1
sake,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
sister's	1
death."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
prefer	1
to	1
have	1
clearer	1
proofs	1
before	1
I	1
speak."	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
tell	1
me	1
whether	1
my	1
own	1
thought	1
is	1
correct,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
died	1
from	1
some	1
sudden	1
fright."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
probably	1
some	1
more	1
tangible	1
cause.	1
And	1
now,	1
Miss	1
Stoner,	1
we	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
for	1
if	1
Dr.	1
Roylott	1
returned	1
and	1
saw	1
us	1
our	1
journey	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
vain.	1
Good-bye,	1
and	1
be	1
brave,	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
drive	1
away	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
threaten	1
you."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
engaging	1
a	1
bedroom	1
and	1
sitting-room	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
Inn.	1
They	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
floor,	1
and	1
from	1
our	1
window	1
we	1
could	1
command	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
avenue	1
gate,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
inhabited	1
wing	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran	1
Manor	1
House.	1
At	1
dusk	1
we	1
saw	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
drive	1
past,	1
his	1
huge	1
form	1
looming	1
up	1
beside	1
the	1
little	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
drove	1
him.	1
The	1
boy	1
had	1
some	1
slight	1
difficulty	1
in	1
undoing	1
the	1
heavy	1
iron	1
gates,	1
and	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
hoarse	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
voice	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
fury	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
clinched	1
fists	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
trap	1
drove	1
on,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
sudden	1
light	1
spring	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
as	1
the	1
lamp	1
was	1
lit	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sitting-rooms.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
sat	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
gathering	1
darkness,	1
"I	1
have	1
really	1
some	1
scruples	1
as	1
to	1
taking	1
you	1
to-night.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
element	1
of	1
danger."	1
	1
"Can	1
I	1
be	1
of	1
assistance?"	1
	1
"Your	1
presence	1
might	1
be	1
invaluable."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
"You	1
speak	1
of	1
danger.	1
You	1
have	1
evidently	1
seen	1
more	1
in	1
these	1
rooms	1
than	1
was	1
visible	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
deduced	1
a	1
little	1
more.	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
did."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
nothing	1
remarkable	1
save	1
the	1
bell-rope,	1
and	1
what	1
purpose	1
that	1
could	1
answer	1
I	1
confess	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
imagine."	1
	1
"You	1
saw	1
the	1
ventilator,	1
too?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
very	1
unusual	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
small	1
opening	1
between	1
two	1
rooms.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
a	1
rat	1
could	1
hardly	1
pass	1
through."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
find	1
a	1
ventilator	1
before	1
ever	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Stoke	1
Moran."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
did.	1
You	1
remember	1
in	1
her	1
statement	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
could	1
smell	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
cigar.	1
Now,	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
suggested	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
communication	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
rooms.	1
It	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
remarked	1
upon	1
at	1
the	1
coroner's	1
inquiry.	1
I	1
deduced	1
a	1
ventilator."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
harm	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
that?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
curious	1
coincidence	1
of	1
dates.	1
A	1
ventilator	1
is	1
made,	1
a	1
cord	1
is	1
hung,	1
and	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
sleeps	1
in	1
the	1
bed	1
dies.	1
Does	1
not	1
that	1
strike	1
you?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
as	1
yet	1
see	1
any	1
connection."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
observe	1
anything	1
very	1
peculiar	1
about	1
that	1
bed?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
clamped	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
a	1
bed	1
fastened	1
like	1
that	1
before?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have."	1
	1
"The	1
lady	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
her	1
bed.	1
It	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
relative	1
position	1
to	1
the	1
ventilator	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rope--or	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
it,	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
clearly	1
never	1
meant	1
for	1
a	1
bell-pull."	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
dimly	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
hinting	1
at.	1
We	1
are	1
only	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
some	1
subtle	1
and	1
horrible	1
crime."	1
	1
"Subtle	1
enough	1
and	1
horrible	1
enough.	1
When	1
a	1
doctor	1
does	1
go	1
wrong	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
criminals.	1
He	1
has	1
nerve	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
knowledge.	1
Palmer	1
and	1
Pritchard	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
their	1
profession.	1
This	1
man	1
strikes	1
even	1
deeper,	1
but	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
strike	1
deeper	1
still.	1
But	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
horrors	1
enough	1
before	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
over;	1
for	1
goodness'	1
sake	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
quiet	1
pipe	1
and	1
turn	1
our	1
minds	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
to	1
something	1
more	1
cheerful."	1
	1
	1
About	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
light	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
was	1
extinguished,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
dark	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Manor	1
House.	1
Two	1
hours	1
passed	1
slowly	1
away,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly,	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
eleven,	1
a	1
single	1
bright	1
light	1
shone	1
out	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
our	1
signal,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
springing	1
to	1
his	1
feet;	1
"it	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
window."	1
	1
As	1
we	1
passed	1
out	1
he	1
exchanged	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
explaining	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
late	1
visit	1
to	1
an	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
there.	1
A	1
moment	1
later	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
road,	1
a	1
chill	1
wind	1
blowing	1
in	1
our	1
faces,	1
and	1
one	1
yellow	1
light	1
twinkling	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
gloom	1
to	1
guide	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
sombre	1
errand.	1
	1
There	1
was	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
entering	1
the	1
grounds,	1
for	1
unrepaired	1
breaches	1
gaped	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
park	1
wall.	1
Making	1
our	1
way	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
lawn,	1
crossed	1
it,	1
and	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
enter	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
when	1
out	1
from	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
laurel	1
bushes	1
there	1
darted	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
hideous	1
and	1
distorted	1
child,	1
who	1
threw	1
itself	1
upon	1
the	1
grass	1
with	1
writhing	1
limbs	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
swiftly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"My	1
God!"	1
I	1
whispered;	1
"did	1
you	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
Holmes	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
as	1
startled	1
as	1
I.	1
His	1
hand	1
closed	1
like	1
a	1
vice	1
upon	1
my	1
wrist	1
in	1
his	1
agitation.	1
Then	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
low	1
laugh	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
my	1
ear.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
household,"	1
he	1
murmured.	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
baboon."	1
	1
I	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
strange	1
pets	1
which	1
the	1
doctor	1
affected.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
cheetah,	1
too;	1
perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
upon	1
our	1
shoulders	1
at	1
any	1
moment.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
easier	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
when,	1
after	1
following	1
Holmes'	1
example	1
and	1
slipping	1
off	1
my	1
shoes,	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
inside	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
My	1
companion	1
noiselessly	1
closed	1
the	1
shutters,	1
moved	1
the	1
lamp	1
onto	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
was	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
daytime.	1
Then	1
creeping	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
trumpet	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
whispered	1
into	1
my	1
ear	1
again	1
so	1
gently	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
distinguish	1
the	1
words:	1
	1
"The	1
least	1
sound	1
would	1
be	1
fatal	1
to	1
our	1
plans."	1
	1
I	1
nodded	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
heard.	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
sit	1
without	1
light.	1
He	1
would	1
see	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
ventilator."	1
	1
I	1
nodded	1
again.	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
go	1
asleep;	1
your	1
very	1
life	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it.	1
Have	1
your	1
pistol	1
ready	1
in	1
case	1
we	1
should	1
need	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
chair."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
my	1
revolver	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
Holmes	1
had	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
thin	1
cane,	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
placed	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
beside	1
him.	1
By	1
it	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
matches	1
and	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
a	1
candle.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
ever	1
forget	1
that	1
dreadful	1
vigil?	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
sound,	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
drawing	1
of	1
a	1
breath,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
my	1
companion	1
sat	1
open-eyed,	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
of	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
nervous	1
tension	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
myself.	1
The	1
shutters	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
least	1
ray	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
we	1
waited	1
in	1
absolute	1
darkness.	1
	1
From	1
outside	1
came	1
the	1
occasional	1
cry	1
of	1
a	1
night-bird,	1
and	1
once	1
at	1
our	1
very	1
window	1
a	1
long	1
drawn	1
catlike	1
whine,	1
which	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
cheetah	1
was	1
indeed	1
at	1
liberty.	1
Far	1
away	1
we	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
deep	1
tones	1
of	1
the	1
parish	1
clock,	1
which	1
boomed	1
out	1
every	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
How	1
long	1
they	1
seemed,	1
those	1
quarters!	1
Twelve	1
struck,	1
and	1
one	1
and	1
two	1
and	1
three,	1
and	1
still	1
we	1
sat	1
waiting	1
silently	1
for	1
whatever	1
might	1
befall.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
momentary	1
gleam	1
of	1
a	1
light	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
ventilator,	1
which	1
vanished	1
immediately,	1
but	1
was	1
succeeded	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
smell	1
of	1
burning	1
oil	1
and	1
heated	1
metal.	1
Someone	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
had	1
lit	1
a	1
dark-lantern.	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
gentle	1
sound	1
of	1
movement,	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
was	1
silent	1
once	1
more,	1
though	1
the	1
smell	1
grew	1
stronger.	1
For	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
I	1
sat	1
with	1
straining	1
ears.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
another	1
sound	1
became	1
audible--a	1
very	1
gentle,	1
soothing	1
sound,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
jet	1
of	1
steam	1
escaping	1
continually	1
from	1
a	1
kettle.	1
The	1
instant	1
that	1
we	1
heard	1
it,	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
from	1
the	1
bed,	1
struck	1
a	1
match,	1
and	1
lashed	1
furiously	1
with	1
his	1
cane	1
at	1
the	1
bell-pull.	1
	1
"You	1
see	1
it,	1
Watson?"	1
he	1
yelled.	1
"You	1
see	1
it?"	1
	1
But	1
I	1
saw	1
nothing.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
Holmes	1
struck	1
the	1
light	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
low,	1
clear	1
whistle,	1
but	1
the	1
sudden	1
glare	1
flashing	1
into	1
my	1
weary	1
eyes	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
which	1
my	1
friend	1
lashed	1
so	1
savagely.	1
I	1
could,	1
however,	1
see	1
that	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
deadly	1
pale	1
and	1
filled	1
with	1
horror	1
and	1
loathing.	1
He	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
strike	1
and	1
was	1
gazing	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
ventilator	1
when	1
suddenly	1
there	1
broke	1
from	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
most	1
horrible	1
cry	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened.	1
It	1
swelled	1
up	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
a	1
hoarse	1
yell	1
of	1
pain	1
and	1
fear	1
and	1
anger	1
all	1
mingled	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
dreadful	1
shriek.	1
They	1
say	1
that	1
away	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
distant	1
parsonage,	1
that	1
cry	1
raised	1
the	1
sleepers	1
from	1
their	1
beds.	1
It	1
struck	1
cold	1
to	1
our	1
hearts,	1
and	1
I	1
stood	1
gazing	1
at	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
me,	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
echoes	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
died	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
silence	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
rose.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
it	1
mean?"	1
I	1
gasped.	1
	1
"It	1
means	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over,"	1
Holmes	1
answered.	1
"And	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
Take	1
your	1
pistol,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
enter	1
Dr.	1
Roylott's	1
room."	1
	1
With	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
he	1
lit	1
the	1
lamp	1
and	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
down	1
the	1
corridor.	1
Twice	1
he	1
struck	1
at	1
the	1
chamber	1
door	1
without	1
any	1
reply	1
from	1
within.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
handle	1
and	1
entered,	1
I	1
at	1
his	1
heels,	1
with	1
the	1
cocked	1
pistol	1
in	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
singular	1
sight	1
which	1
met	1
our	1
eyes.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
stood	1
a	1
dark-lantern	1
with	1
the	1
shutter	1
half	1
open,	1
throwing	1
a	1
brilliant	1
beam	1
of	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
iron	1
safe,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
ajar.	1
Beside	1
this	1
table,	1
on	1
the	1
wooden	1
chair,	1
sat	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
grey	1
dressing-gown,	1
his	1
bare	1
ankles	1
protruding	1
beneath,	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
thrust	1
into	1
red	1
heelless	1
Turkish	1
slippers.	1
Across	1
his	1
lap	1
lay	1
the	1
short	1
stock	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
lash	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
noticed	1
during	1
the	1
day.	1
His	1
chin	1
was	1
cocked	1
upward	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful,	1
rigid	1
stare	1
at	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
ceiling.	1
Round	1
his	1
brow	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
yellow	1
band,	1
with	1
brownish	1
speckles,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
tightly	1
round	1
his	1
head.	1
As	1
we	1
entered	1
he	1
made	1
neither	1
sound	1
nor	1
motion.	1
	1
"The	1
band!	1
the	1
speckled	1
band!"	1
whispered	1
Holmes.	1
	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
forward.	1
In	1
an	1
instant	1
his	1
strange	1
headgear	1
began	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
there	1
reared	1
itself	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
hair	1
the	1
squat	1
diamond-shaped	1
head	1
and	1
puffed	1
neck	1
of	1
a	1
loathsome	1
serpent.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
swamp	1
adder!"	1
cried	1
Holmes;	1
"the	1
deadliest	1
snake	1
in	1
India.	1
He	1
has	1
died	1
within	1
ten	1
seconds	1
of	1
being	1
bitten.	1
Violence	1
does,	1
in	1
truth,	1
recoil	1
upon	1
the	1
violent,	1
and	1
the	1
schemer	1
falls	1
into	1
the	1
pit	1
which	1
he	1
digs	1
for	1
another.	1
Let	1
us	1
thrust	1
this	1
creature	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
den,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
then	1
remove	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
to	1
some	1
place	1
of	1
shelter	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
county	1
police	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
happened."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
drew	1
the	1
dog-whip	1
swiftly	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
man's	1
lap,	1
and	1
throwing	1
the	1
noose	1
round	1
the	1
reptile's	1
neck	1
he	1
drew	1
it	1
from	1
its	1
horrid	1
perch	1
and,	1
carrying	1
it	1
at	1
arm's	1
length,	1
threw	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
iron	1
safe,	1
which	1
he	1
closed	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
Such	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott,	1
of	1
Stoke	1
Moran.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prolong	1
a	1
narrative	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
run	1
to	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
length	1
by	1
telling	1
how	1
we	1
broke	1
the	1
sad	1
news	1
to	1
the	1
terrified	1
girl,	1
how	1
we	1
conveyed	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
morning	1
train	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
aunt	1
at	1
Harrow,	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
slow	1
process	1
of	1
official	1
inquiry	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
met	1
his	1
fate	1
while	1
indiscreetly	1
playing	1
with	1
a	1
dangerous	1
pet.	1
The	1
little	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
yet	1
to	1
learn	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
by	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
as	1
we	1
travelled	1
back	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"I	1
had,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"come	1
to	1
an	1
entirely	1
erroneous	1
conclusion	1
which	1
shows,	1
my	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
how	1
dangerous	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
to	1
reason	1
from	1
insufficient	1
data.	1
The	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
gipsies,	1
and	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
'band,'	1
which	1
was	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
poor	1
girl,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
appearance	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
hurried	1
glimpse	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
her	1
match,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
upon	1
an	1
entirely	1
wrong	1
scent.	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
claim	1
the	1
merit	1
that	1
I	1
instantly	1
reconsidered	1
my	1
position	1
when,	1
however,	1
it	1
became	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
whatever	1
danger	1
threatened	1
an	1
occupant	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
or	1
the	1
door.	1
My	1
attention	1
was	1
speedily	1
drawn,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
remarked	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
this	1
ventilator,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
bell-rope	1
which	1
hung	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
discovery	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
dummy,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
clamped	1
to	1
the	1
floor,	1
instantly	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
suspicion	1
that	1
the	1
rope	1
was	1
there	1
as	1
a	1
bridge	1
for	1
something	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
bed.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
snake	1
instantly	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
coupled	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
creatures	1
from	1
India,	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
probably	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
track.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
using	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
poison	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be	1
discovered	1
by	1
any	1
chemical	1
test	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
would	1
occur	1
to	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
ruthless	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
an	1
Eastern	1
training.	1
The	1
rapidity	1
with	1
which	1
such	1
a	1
poison	1
would	1
take	1
effect	1
would	1
also,	1
from	1
his	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
be	1
an	1
advantage.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sharp-eyed	1
coroner,	1
indeed,	1
who	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
two	1
little	1
dark	1
punctures	1
which	1
would	1
show	1
where	1
the	1
poison	1
fangs	1
had	1
done	1
their	1
work.	1
Then	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
whistle.	1
Of	1
course	1
he	1
must	1
recall	1
the	1
snake	1
before	1
the	1
morning	1
light	1
revealed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
victim.	1
He	1
had	1
trained	1
it,	1
probably	1
by	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
which	1
we	1
saw,	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
summoned.	1
He	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
through	1
this	1
ventilator	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
best,	1
with	1
the	1
certainty	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
crawl	1
down	1
the	1
rope	1
and	1
land	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
It	1
might	1
or	1
might	1
not	1
bite	1
the	1
occupant,	1
perhaps	1
she	1
might	1
escape	1
every	1
night	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
but	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
she	1
must	1
fall	1
a	1
victim.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
these	1
conclusions	1
before	1
ever	1
I	1
had	1
entered	1
his	1
room.	1
An	1
inspection	1
of	1
his	1
chair	1
showed	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
standing	1
on	1
it,	1
which	1
of	1
course	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
ventilator.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
safe,	1
the	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk,	1
and	1
the	1
loop	1
of	1
whipcord	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
finally	1
dispel	1
any	1
doubts	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
remained.	1
The	1
metallic	1
clang	1
heard	1
by	1
Miss	1
Stoner	1
was	1
obviously	1
caused	1
by	1
her	1
stepfather	1
hastily	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
safe	1
upon	1
its	1
terrible	1
occupant.	1
Having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
steps	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
proof.	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
creature	1
hiss	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
also,	1
and	1
I	1
instantly	1
lit	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
attacked	1
it."	1
	1
"With	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
driving	1
it	1
through	1
the	1
ventilator."	1
	1
"And	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
causing	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
its	1
master	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
blows	1
of	1
my	1
cane	1
came	1
home	1
and	1
roused	1
its	1
snakish	1
temper,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
flew	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
it	1
saw.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
doubt	1
indirectly	1
responsible	1
for	1
Dr.	1
Grimesby	1
Roylott's	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
weigh	1
very	1
heavily	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience."	1
	1
	1
	1
IX.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
ENGINEER'S	1
THUMB	1
	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
problems	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
submitted	1
to	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
solution	1
during	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
our	1
intimacy,	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
two	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
introducing	1
to	1
his	1
notice--that	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley's	1
thumb,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Warburton's	1
madness.	1
Of	1
these	1
the	1
latter	1
may	1
have	1
afforded	1
a	1
finer	1
field	1
for	1
an	1
acute	1
and	1
original	1
observer,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
in	1
its	1
inception	1
and	1
so	1
dramatic	1
in	1
its	1
details	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
placed	1
upon	1
record,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
gave	1
my	1
friend	1
fewer	1
openings	1
for	1
those	1
deductive	1
methods	1
of	1
reasoning	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
achieved	1
such	1
remarkable	1
results.	1
The	1
story	1
has,	1
I	1
believe,	1
been	1
told	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
newspapers,	1
but,	1
like	1
all	1
such	1
narratives,	1
its	1
effect	1
is	1
much	1
less	1
striking	1
when	1
set	1
forth	1
en	1
bloc	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
half-column	1
of	1
print	1
than	1
when	1
the	1
facts	1
slowly	1
evolve	1
before	1
your	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
mystery	1
clears	1
gradually	1
away	1
as	1
each	1
new	1
discovery	1
furnishes	1
a	1
step	1
which	1
leads	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
complete	1
truth.	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
circumstances	1
made	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
has	1
hardly	1
served	1
to	1
weaken	1
the	1
effect.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
'89,	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
my	1
marriage,	1
that	1
the	1
events	1
occurred	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
summarise.	1
I	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
civil	1
practice	1
and	1
had	1
finally	1
abandoned	1
Holmes	1
in	1
his	1
Baker	1
Street	1
rooms,	1
although	1
I	1
continually	1
visited	1
him	1
and	1
occasionally	1
even	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
forgo	1
his	1
Bohemian	1
habits	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
us.	1
My	1
practice	1
had	1
steadily	1
increased,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
no	1
very	1
great	1
distance	1
from	1
Paddington	1
Station,	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
few	1
patients	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
officials.	1
One	1
of	1
these,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
cured	1
of	1
a	1
painful	1
and	1
lingering	1
disease,	1
was	1
never	1
weary	1
of	1
advertising	1
my	1
virtues	1
and	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
on	1
every	1
sufferer	1
over	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
any	1
influence.	1
	1
One	1
morning,	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
I	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
the	1
maid	1
tapping	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
two	1
men	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Paddington	1
and	1
were	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
consulting-room.	1
I	1
dressed	1
hurriedly,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
railway	1
cases	1
were	1
seldom	1
trivial,	1
and	1
hastened	1
downstairs.	1
As	1
I	1
descended,	1
my	1
old	1
ally,	1
the	1
guard,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
tightly	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
"I've	1
got	1
him	1
here,"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
jerking	1
his	1
thumb	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder;	1
"he's	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
then?"	1
I	1
asked,	1
for	1
his	1
manner	1
suggested	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
strange	1
creature	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
caged	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
room.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
new	1
patient,"	1
he	1
whispered.	1
"I	1
thought	1
I'd	1
bring	1
him	1
round	1
myself;	1
then	1
he	1
couldn't	1
slip	1
away.	1
There	1
he	1
is,	1
all	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
now,	1
Doctor;	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
dooties,	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
you."	1
And	1
off	1
he	1
went,	1
this	1
trusty	1
tout,	1
without	1
even	1
giving	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
thank	1
him.	1
	1
I	1
entered	1
my	1
consulting-room	1
and	1
found	1
a	1
gentleman	1
seated	1
by	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
was	1
quietly	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
heather	1
tweed	1
with	1
a	1
soft	1
cloth	1
cap	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
down	1
upon	1
my	1
books.	1
Round	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
wrapped,	1
which	1
was	1
mottled	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
bloodstains.	1
He	1
was	1
young,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five-and-twenty,	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
with	1
a	1
strong,	1
masculine	1
face;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pale	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
suffering	1
from	1
some	1
strong	1
agitation,	1
which	1
it	1
took	1
all	1
his	1
strength	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
control.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
knock	1
you	1
up	1
so	1
early,	1
Doctor,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
accident	1
during	1
the	1
night.	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
by	1
train	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
on	1
inquiring	1
at	1
Paddington	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
a	1
doctor,	1
a	1
worthy	1
fellow	1
very	1
kindly	1
escorted	1
me	1
here.	1
I	1
gave	1
the	1
maid	1
a	1
card,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
left	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
side-table."	1
	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
it.	1
"Mr.	1
Victor	1
Hatherley,	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
16A,	1
Victoria	1
Street	1
(3rd	1
floor)."	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
name,	1
style,	1
and	1
abode	1
of	1
my	1
morning	1
visitor.	1
"I	1
regret	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
you	1
waiting,"	1
said	1
I,	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
my	1
library-chair.	1
"You	1
are	1
fresh	1
from	1
a	1
night	1
journey,	1
I	1
understand,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
a	1
monotonous	1
occupation."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
night	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
called	1
monotonous,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
He	1
laughed	1
very	1
heartily,	1
with	1
a	1
high,	1
ringing	1
note,	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
sides.	1
All	1
my	1
medical	1
instincts	1
rose	1
up	1
against	1
that	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Stop	1
it!"	1
I	1
cried;	1
"pull	1
yourself	1
together!"	1
and	1
I	1
poured	1
out	1
some	1
water	1
from	1
a	1
caraffe.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
useless,	1
however.	1
He	1
was	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
hysterical	1
outbursts	1
which	1
come	1
upon	1
a	1
strong	1
nature	1
when	1
some	1
great	1
crisis	1
is	1
over	1
and	1
gone.	1
Presently	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
once	1
more,	1
very	1
weary	1
and	1
pale-looking.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
myself,"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
Drink	1
this."	1
I	1
dashed	1
some	1
brandy	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
bloodless	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"That's	1
better!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Doctor,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
kindly	1
attend	1
to	1
my	1
thumb,	1
or	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
my	1
thumb	1
used	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
He	1
unwound	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
It	1
gave	1
even	1
my	1
hardened	1
nerves	1
a	1
shudder	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
There	1
were	1
four	1
protruding	1
fingers	1
and	1
a	1
horrid	1
red,	1
spongy	1
surface	1
where	1
the	1
thumb	1
should	1
have	1
been.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
hacked	1
or	1
torn	1
right	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
I	1
cried,	1
"this	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
injury.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
bled	1
considerably."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
did.	1
I	1
fainted	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
senseless	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
bleeding,	1
so	1
I	1
tied	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
very	1
tightly	1
round	1
the	1
wrist	1
and	1
braced	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
twig."	1
	1
"Excellent!	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
surgeon."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
hydraulics,	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
came	1
within	1
my	1
own	1
province."	1
	1
"This	1
has	1
been	1
done,"	1
said	1
I,	1
examining	1
the	1
wound,	1
"by	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
and	1
sharp	1
instrument."	1
	1
"A	1
thing	1
like	1
a	1
cleaver,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"An	1
accident,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"By	1
no	1
means."	1
	1
"What!	1
a	1
murderous	1
attack?"	1
	1
"Very	1
murderous	1
indeed."	1
	1
"You	1
horrify	1
me."	1
	1
I	1
sponged	1
the	1
wound,	1
cleaned	1
it,	1
dressed	1
it,	1
and	1
finally	1
covered	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
cotton	1
wadding	1
and	1
carbolised	1
bandages.	1
He	1
lay	1
back	1
without	1
wincing,	1
though	1
he	1
bit	1
his	1
lip	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?"	1
I	1
asked	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
finished.	1
	1
"Capital!	1
Between	1
your	1
brandy	1
and	1
your	1
bandage,	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
new	1
man.	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
weak,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
go	1
through."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
your	1
nerves."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
no,	1
not	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
my	1
tale	1
to	1
the	1
police;	1
but,	1
between	1
ourselves,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
convincing	1
evidence	1
of	1
this	1
wound	1
of	1
mine,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
they	1
believed	1
my	1
statement,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
extraordinary	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
proof	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
back	1
it	1
up;	1
and,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
clues	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
them	1
are	1
so	1
vague	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
whether	1
justice	1
will	1
be	1
done."	1
	1
"Ha!"	1
cried	1
I,	1
"if	1
it	1
is	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
problem	1
which	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
solved,	1
I	1
should	1
strongly	1
recommend	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
before	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
official	1
police."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
that	1
fellow,"	1
answered	1
my	1
visitor,	1
"and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
though	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
must	1
use	1
the	1
official	1
police	1
as	1
well.	1
Would	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
introduction	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
"I'll	1
do	1
better.	1
I'll	1
take	1
you	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
myself."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
immensely	1
obliged	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"We'll	1
call	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
go	1
together.	1
We	1
shall	1
just	1
be	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
breakfast	1
with	1
him.	1
Do	1
you	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
it?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
feel	1
easy	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
my	1
story."	1
	1
"Then	1
my	1
servant	1
will	1
call	1
a	1
cab,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
instant."	1
I	1
rushed	1
upstairs,	1
explained	1
the	1
matter	1
shortly	1
to	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
in	1
five	1
minutes	1
was	1
inside	1
a	1
hansom,	1
driving	1
with	1
my	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
was,	1
as	1
I	1
expected,	1
lounging	1
about	1
his	1
sitting-room	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-gown,	1
reading	1
the	1
agony	1
column	1
of	1
The	1
Times	1
and	1
smoking	1
his	1
before-breakfast	1
pipe,	1
which	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plugs	1
and	1
dottles	1
left	1
from	1
his	1
smokes	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
all	1
carefully	1
dried	1
and	1
collected	1
on	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
He	1
received	1
us	1
in	1
his	1
quietly	1
genial	1
fashion,	1
ordered	1
fresh	1
rashers	1
and	1
eggs,	1
and	1
joined	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
hearty	1
meal.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
concluded	1
he	1
settled	1
our	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
upon	1
the	1
sofa,	1
placed	1
a	1
pillow	1
beneath	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
laid	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
brandy	1
and	1
water	1
within	1
his	1
reach.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
experience	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
common	1
one,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Pray,	1
lie	1
down	1
there	1
and	1
make	1
yourself	1
absolutely	1
at	1
home.	1
Tell	1
us	1
what	1
you	1
can,	1
but	1
stop	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
tired	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
your	1
strength	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
stimulant."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
my	1
patient,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
another	1
man	1
since	1
the	1
doctor	1
bandaged	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
your	1
breakfast	1
has	1
completed	1
the	1
cure.	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
as	1
little	1
of	1
your	1
valuable	1
time	1
as	1
possible,	1
so	1
I	1
shall	1
start	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
my	1
peculiar	1
experiences."	1
	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
big	1
armchair	1
with	1
the	1
weary,	1
heavy-lidded	1
expression	1
which	1
veiled	1
his	1
keen	1
and	1
eager	1
nature,	1
while	1
I	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
the	1
strange	1
story	1
which	1
our	1
visitor	1
detailed	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
know,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
residing	1
alone	1
in	1
lodgings	1
in	1
London.	1
By	1
profession	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
considerable	1
experience	1
of	1
my	1
work	1
during	1
the	1
seven	1
years	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
apprenticed	1
to	1
Venner	1
&	1
Matheson,	1
the	1
well-known	1
firm,	1
of	1
Greenwich.	1
Two	1
years	1
ago,	1
having	1
served	1
my	1
time,	1
and	1
having	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
a	1
fair	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
through	1
my	1
poor	1
father's	1
death,	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
start	1
in	1
business	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
took	1
professional	1
chambers	1
in	1
Victoria	1
Street.	1
	1
"I	1
suppose	1
that	1
everyone	1
finds	1
his	1
first	1
independent	1
start	1
in	1
business	1
a	1
dreary	1
experience.	1
To	1
me	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
exceptionally	1
so.	1
During	1
two	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
three	1
consultations	1
and	1
one	1
small	1
job,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
absolutely	1
all	1
that	1
my	1
profession	1
has	1
brought	1
me.	1
My	1
gross	1
takings	1
amount	1
to	1
27	1
pounds	1
10s.	1
Every	1
day,	1
from	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
until	1
four	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
I	1
waited	1
in	1
my	1
little	1
den,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
my	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
sink,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
any	1
practice	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
"Yesterday,	1
however,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
office,	1
my	1
clerk	1
entered	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
waiting	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
upon	1
business.	1
He	1
brought	1
up	1
a	1
card,	1
too,	1
with	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
'Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark'	1
engraved	1
upon	1
it.	1
Close	1
at	1
his	1
heels	1
came	1
the	1
colonel	1
himself,	1
a	1
man	1
rather	1
over	1
the	1
middle	1
size,	1
but	1
of	1
an	1
exceeding	1
thinness.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
so	1
thin	1
a	1
man.	1
His	1
whole	1
face	1
sharpened	1
away	1
into	1
nose	1
and	1
chin,	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks	1
was	1
drawn	1
quite	1
tense	1
over	1
his	1
outstanding	1
bones.	1
Yet	1
this	1
emaciation	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
natural	1
habit,	1
and	1
due	1
to	1
no	1
disease,	1
for	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
bright,	1
his	1
step	1
brisk,	1
and	1
his	1
bearing	1
assured.	1
He	1
was	1
plainly	1
but	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
and	1
his	1
age,	1
I	1
should	1
judge,	1
would	1
be	1
nearer	1
forty	1
than	1
thirty.	1
	1
"'Mr.	1
Hatherley?'	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
German	1
accent.	1
'You	1
have	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
proficient	1
in	1
his	1
profession	1
but	1
is	1
also	1
discreet	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
preserving	1
a	1
secret.'	1
	1
"I	1
bowed,	1
feeling	1
as	1
flattered	1
as	1
any	1
young	1
man	1
would	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
address.	1
'May	1
I	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
gave	1
me	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
character?'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
source	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
both	1
an	1
orphan	1
and	1
a	1
bachelor	1
and	1
are	1
residing	1
alone	1
in	1
London.'	1
	1
"'That	1
is	1
quite	1
correct,'	1
I	1
answered;	1
'but	1
you	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
how	1
all	1
this	1
bears	1
upon	1
my	1
professional	1
qualifications.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
professional	1
matter	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
me?'	1
	1
"'Undoubtedly	1
so.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
that	1
all	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
really	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
professional	1
commission	1
for	1
you,	1
but	1
absolute	1
secrecy	1
is	1
quite	1
essential--absolute	1
secrecy,	1
you	1
understand,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
we	1
may	1
expect	1
that	1
more	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
alone	1
than	1
from	1
one	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
his	1
family.'	1
	1
"'If	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
secret,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
may	1
absolutely	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
doing	1
so.'	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
very	1
hard	1
at	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
spoke,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
suspicious	1
and	1
questioning	1
an	1
eye.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
promise,	1
then?'	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
I	1
promise.'	1
	1
"'Absolute	1
and	1
complete	1
silence	1
before,	1
during,	1
and	1
after?	1
No	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
all,	1
either	1
in	1
word	1
or	1
writing?'	1
	1
"'I	1
have	1
already	1
given	1
you	1
my	1
word.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
good.'	1
He	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
darting	1
like	1
lightning	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
he	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
passage	1
outside	1
was	1
empty.	1
	1
"'That's	1
all	1
right,'	1
said	1
he,	1
coming	1
back.	1
'I	1
know	1
that	1
clerks	1
are	1
sometimes	1
curious	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
master's	1
affairs.	1
Now	1
we	1
can	1
talk	1
in	1
safety.'	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair	1
very	1
close	1
to	1
mine	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
me	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
questioning	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
look.	1
	1
"A	1
feeling	1
of	1
repulsion,	1
and	1
of	1
something	1
akin	1
to	1
fear	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
rise	1
within	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
antics	1
of	1
this	1
fleshless	1
man.	1
Even	1
my	1
dread	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
client	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
me	1
from	1
showing	1
my	1
impatience.	1
	1
"'I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
state	1
your	1
business,	1
sir,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'my	1
time	1
is	1
of	1
value.'	1
Heaven	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
that	1
last	1
sentence,	1
but	1
the	1
words	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
lips.	1
	1
"'How	1
would	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
for	1
a	1
night's	1
work	1
suit	1
you?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Most	1
admirably.'	1
	1
"'I	1
say	1
a	1
night's	1
work,	1
but	1
an	1
hour's	1
would	1
be	1
nearer	1
the	1
mark.	1
I	1
simply	1
want	1
your	1
opinion	1
about	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
stamping	1
machine	1
which	1
has	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
gear.	1
If	1
you	1
show	1
us	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
set	1
it	1
right	1
ourselves.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
commission	1
as	1
that?'	1
	1
"'The	1
work	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
pay	1
munificent.'	1
	1
"'Precisely	1
so.	1
We	1
shall	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to-night	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
train.'	1
	1
"'Where	1
to?'	1
	1
"'To	1
Eyford,	1
in	1
Berkshire.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
place	1
near	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Oxfordshire,	1
and	1
within	1
seven	1
miles	1
of	1
Reading.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
train	1
from	1
Paddington	1
which	1
would	1
bring	1
you	1
there	1
at	1
about	1
11:15.'	1
	1
"'Very	1
good.'	1
	1
"'I	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
meet	1
you.'	1
	1
"'There	1
is	1
a	1
drive,	1
then?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
our	1
little	1
place	1
is	1
quite	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
seven	1
miles	1
from	1
Eyford	1
Station.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
get	1
there	1
before	1
midnight.	1
I	1
suppose	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
train	1
back.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
night.'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
we	1
could	1
easily	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
shake-down.'	1
	1
"'That	1
is	1
very	1
awkward.	1
Could	1
I	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
some	1
more	1
convenient	1
hour?'	1
	1
"'We	1
have	1
judged	1
it	1
best	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
come	1
late.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
any	1
inconvenience	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
paying	1
to	1
you,	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
unknown	1
man,	1
a	1
fee	1
which	1
would	1
buy	1
an	1
opinion	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
heads	1
of	1
your	1
profession.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
do	1
so.'	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
fifty	1
guineas,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
very	1
useful	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
me.	1
'Not	1
at	1
all,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
happy	1
to	1
accommodate	1
myself	1
to	1
your	1
wishes.	1
I	1
should	1
like,	1
however,	1
to	1
understand	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
clearly	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
so.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
natural	1
that	1
the	1
pledge	1
of	1
secrecy	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
exacted	1
from	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
aroused	1
your	1
curiosity.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
commit	1
you	1
to	1
anything	1
without	1
your	1
having	1
it	1
all	1
laid	1
before	1
you.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
absolutely	1
safe	1
from	1
eavesdroppers?'	1
	1
"'Entirely.'	1
	1
"'Then	1
the	1
matter	1
stands	1
thus.	1
You	1
are	1
probably	1
aware	1
that	1
fuller's-earth	1
is	1
a	1
valuable	1
product,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
places	1
in	1
England?'	1
	1
"'I	1
have	1
heard	1
so.'	1
	1
"'Some	1
little	1
time	1
ago	1
I	1
bought	1
a	1
small	1
place--a	1
very	1
small	1
place--within	1
ten	1
miles	1
of	1
Reading.	1
I	1
was	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deposit	1
of	1
fuller's-earth	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
fields.	1
On	1
examining	1
it,	1
however,	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
this	1
deposit	1
was	1
a	1
comparatively	1
small	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
formed	1
a	1
link	1
between	1
two	1
very	1
much	1
larger	1
ones	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left--both	1
of	1
them,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
my	1
neighbours.	1
These	1
good	1
people	1
were	1
absolutely	1
ignorant	1
that	1
their	1
land	1
contained	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
valuable	1
as	1
a	1
gold-mine.	1
Naturally,	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
my	1
interest	1
to	1
buy	1
their	1
land	1
before	1
they	1
discovered	1
its	1
true	1
value,	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
capital	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
this.	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
my	1
friends	1
into	1
the	1
secret,	1
however,	1
and	1
they	1
suggested	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
quietly	1
and	1
secretly	1
work	1
our	1
own	1
little	1
deposit	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
should	1
earn	1
the	1
money	1
which	1
would	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
fields.	1
This	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
doing	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
help	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
operations	1
we	1
erected	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
press.	1
This	1
press,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
explained,	1
has	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
order,	1
and	1
we	1
wish	1
your	1
advice	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
We	1
guard	1
our	1
secret	1
very	1
jealously,	1
however,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
once	1
became	1
known	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
hydraulic	1
engineers	1
coming	1
to	1
our	1
little	1
house,	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
rouse	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
then,	1
if	1
the	1
facts	1
came	1
out,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
good-bye	1
to	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
getting	1
these	1
fields	1
and	1
carrying	1
out	1
our	1
plans.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
you	1
promise	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Eyford	1
to-night.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
all	1
plain?'	1
	1
"'I	1
quite	1
follow	1
you,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'The	1
only	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
quite	1
understand	1
was	1
what	1
use	1
you	1
could	1
make	1
of	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
press	1
in	1
excavating	1
fuller's-earth,	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
is	1
dug	1
out	1
like	1
gravel	1
from	1
a	1
pit.'	1
	1
"'Ah!'	1
said	1
he	1
carelessly,	1
'we	1
have	1
our	1
own	1
process.	1
We	1
compress	1
the	1
earth	1
into	1
bricks,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
remove	1
them	1
without	1
revealing	1
what	1
they	1
are.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
detail.	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
fully	1
into	1
my	1
confidence	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Hatherley,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
shown	1
you	1
how	1
I	1
trust	1
you.'	1
He	1
rose	1
as	1
he	1
spoke.	1
'I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you,	1
then,	1
at	1
Eyford	1
at	1
11:15.'	1
	1
"'I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
there.'	1
	1
"'And	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
a	1
soul.'	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
last	1
long,	1
questioning	1
gaze,	1
and	1
then,	1
pressing	1
my	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
dank	1
grasp,	1
he	1
hurried	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
cool	1
blood	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
astonished,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
both	1
think,	1
at	1
this	1
sudden	1
commission	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
intrusted	1
to	1
me.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
was	1
glad,	1
for	1
the	1
fee	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
tenfold	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
asked	1
had	1
I	1
set	1
a	1
price	1
upon	1
my	1
own	1
services,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
order	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
other	1
ones.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
my	1
patron	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
his	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's-earth	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
my	1
coming	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
his	1
extreme	1
anxiety	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
anyone	1
of	1
my	1
errand.	1
However,	1
I	1
threw	1
all	1
fears	1
to	1
the	1
winds,	1
ate	1
a	1
hearty	1
supper,	1
drove	1
to	1
Paddington,	1
and	1
started	1
off,	1
having	1
obeyed	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
the	1
injunction	1
as	1
to	1
holding	1
my	1
tongue.	1
	1
"At	1
Reading	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
change	1
not	1
only	1
my	1
carriage	1
but	1
my	1
station.	1
However,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
train	1
to	1
Eyford,	1
and	1
I	1
reached	1
the	1
little	1
dim-lit	1
station	1
after	1
eleven	1
o'clock.	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
passenger	1
who	1
got	1
out	1
there,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
platform	1
save	1
a	1
single	1
sleepy	1
porter	1
with	1
a	1
lantern.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
wicket	1
gate,	1
however,	1
I	1
found	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
grasped	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
hurried	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
carriage,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
standing	1
open.	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
tapped	1
on	1
the	1
wood-work,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
went	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
could	1
go."	1
	1
"One	1
horse?"	1
interjected	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
only	1
one."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
observe	1
the	1
colour?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
side-lights	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
stepping	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
chestnut."	1
	1
"Tired-looking	1
or	1
fresh?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
fresh	1
and	1
glossy."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
interrupted	1
you.	1
Pray	1
continue	1
your	1
most	1
interesting	1
statement."	1
	1
"Away	1
we	1
went	1
then,	1
and	1
we	1
drove	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour.	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
seven	1
miles,	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
from	1
the	1
rate	1
that	1
we	1
seemed	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
we	1
took,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
nearer	1
twelve.	1
He	1
sat	1
at	1
my	1
side	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
aware,	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
when	1
I	1
glanced	1
in	1
his	1
direction,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
great	1
intensity.	1
The	1
country	1
roads	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
very	1
good	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
we	1
lurched	1
and	1
jolted	1
terribly.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
where	1
we	1
were,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
frosted	1
glass,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
nothing	1
save	1
the	1
occasional	1
bright	1
blur	1
of	1
a	1
passing	1
light.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
hazarded	1
some	1
remark	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
but	1
the	1
colonel	1
answered	1
only	1
in	1
monosyllables,	1
and	1
the	1
conversation	1
soon	1
flagged.	1
At	1
last,	1
however,	1
the	1
bumping	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
exchanged	1
for	1
the	1
crisp	1
smoothness	1
of	1
a	1
gravel-drive,	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stand.	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
sprang	1
out,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
after	1
him,	1
pulled	1
me	1
swiftly	1
into	1
a	1
porch	1
which	1
gaped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
We	1
stepped,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
right	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
failed	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
most	1
fleeting	1
glance	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
instant	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
threshold	1
the	1
door	1
slammed	1
heavily	1
behind	1
us,	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
faintly	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
away.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
pitch	1
dark	1
inside	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
fumbled	1
about	1
looking	1
for	1
matches	1
and	1
muttering	1
under	1
his	1
breath.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
door	1
opened	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
a	1
long,	1
golden	1
bar	1
of	1
light	1
shot	1
out	1
in	1
our	1
direction.	1
It	1
grew	1
broader,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
appeared	1
with	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
which	1
she	1
held	1
above	1
her	1
head,	1
pushing	1
her	1
face	1
forward	1
and	1
peering	1
at	1
us.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
pretty,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
gloss	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
shone	1
upon	1
her	1
dark	1
dress	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
rich	1
material.	1
She	1
spoke	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
tongue	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
as	1
though	1
asking	1
a	1
question,	1
and	1
when	1
my	1
companion	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
gruff	1
monosyllable	1
she	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
start	1
that	1
the	1
lamp	1
nearly	1
fell	1
from	1
her	1
hand.	1
Colonel	1
Stark	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
whispered	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
ear,	1
and	1
then,	1
pushing	1
her	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
whence	1
she	1
had	1
come,	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
me	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
lamp	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"'Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
kindness	1
to	1
wait	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,'	1
said	1
he,	1
throwing	1
open	1
another	1
door.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
quiet,	1
little,	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
room,	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
on	1
which	1
several	1
German	1
books	1
were	1
scattered.	1
Colonel	1
Stark	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
lamp	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
harmonium	1
beside	1
the	1
door.	1
'I	1
shall	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
waiting	1
an	1
instant,'	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"I	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
books	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
my	1
ignorance	1
of	1
German	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
treatises	1
on	1
science,	1
the	1
others	1
being	1
volumes	1
of	1
poetry.	1
Then	1
I	1
walked	1
across	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
hoping	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
catch	1
some	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
country-side,	1
but	1
an	1
oak	1
shutter,	1
heavily	1
barred,	1
was	1
folded	1
across	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
silent	1
house.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
clock	1
ticking	1
loudly	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
passage,	1
but	1
otherwise	1
everything	1
was	1
deadly	1
still.	1
A	1
vague	1
feeling	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
began	1
to	1
steal	1
over	1
me.	1
Who	1
were	1
these	1
German	1
people,	1
and	1
what	1
were	1
they	1
doing	1
living	1
in	1
this	1
strange,	1
out-of-the-way	1
place?	1
And	1
where	1
was	1
the	1
place?	1
I	1
was	1
ten	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1
from	1
Eyford,	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
knew,	1
but	1
whether	1
north,	1
south,	1
east,	1
or	1
west	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea.	1
For	1
that	1
matter,	1
Reading,	1
and	1
possibly	1
other	1
large	1
towns,	1
were	1
within	1
that	1
radius,	1
so	1
the	1
place	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
secluded,	1
after	1
all.	1
Yet	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
certain,	1
from	1
the	1
absolute	1
stillness,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
I	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
humming	1
a	1
tune	1
under	1
my	1
breath	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
my	1
spirits	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
earning	1
my	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee.	1
	1
"Suddenly,	1
without	1
any	1
preliminary	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
utter	1
stillness,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
swung	1
slowly	1
open.	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
aperture,	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
behind	1
her,	1
the	1
yellow	1
light	1
from	1
my	1
lamp	1
beating	1
upon	1
her	1
eager	1
and	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick	1
with	1
fear,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
heart.	1
She	1
held	1
up	1
one	1
shaking	1
finger	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
and	1
she	1
shot	1
a	1
few	1
whispered	1
words	1
of	1
broken	1
English	1
at	1
me,	1
her	1
eyes	1
glancing	1
back,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
frightened	1
horse,	1
into	1
the	1
gloom	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
"'I	1
would	1
go,'	1
said	1
she,	1
trying	1
hard,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
speak	1
calmly;	1
'I	1
would	1
go.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
here.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
do.'	1
	1
"'But,	1
madam,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
came	1
for.	1
I	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
leave	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
machine.'	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
your	1
while	1
to	1
wait,'	1
she	1
went	1
on.	1
'You	1
can	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
door;	1
no	1
one	1
hinders.'	1
And	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
my	1
head,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
threw	1
aside	1
her	1
constraint	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
step	1
forward,	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
wrung	1
together.	1
'For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Heaven!'	1
she	1
whispered,	1
'get	1
away	1
from	1
here	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late!'	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
somewhat	1
headstrong	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
an	1
affair	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
obstacle	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee,	1
of	1
my	1
wearisome	1
journey,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
night	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
before	1
me.	1
Was	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
nothing?	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
slink	1
away	1
without	1
having	1
carried	1
out	1
my	1
commission,	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
payment	1
which	1
was	1
my	1
due?	1
This	1
woman	1
might,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
knew,	1
be	1
a	1
monomaniac.	1
With	1
a	1
stout	1
bearing,	1
therefore,	1
though	1
her	1
manner	1
had	1
shaken	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
cared	1
to	1
confess,	1
I	1
still	1
shook	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
declared	1
my	1
intention	1
of	1
remaining	1
where	1
I	1
was.	1
She	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
renew	1
her	1
entreaties	1
when	1
a	1
door	1
slammed	1
overhead,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
several	1
footsteps	1
was	1
heard	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs.	1
She	1
listened	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
threw	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
despairing	1
gesture,	1
and	1
vanished	1
as	1
suddenly	1
and	1
as	1
noiselessly	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
come.	1
	1
"The	1
newcomers	1
were	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
thick	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
chinchilla	1
beard	1
growing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
double	1
chin,	1
who	1
was	1
introduced	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Ferguson.	1
	1
"'This	1
is	1
my	1
secretary	1
and	1
manager,'	1
said	1
the	1
colonel.	1
'By	1
the	1
way,	1
I	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
this	1
door	1
shut	1
just	1
now.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
felt	1
the	1
draught.'	1
	1
"'On	1
the	1
contrary,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'I	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
myself	1
because	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
close.'	1
	1
"He	1
shot	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
suspicious	1
looks	1
at	1
me.	1
'Perhaps	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
proceed	1
to	1
business,	1
then,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'Mr.	1
Ferguson	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
machine.'	1
	1
"'I	1
had	1
better	1
put	1
my	1
hat	1
on,	1
I	1
suppose.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
no,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
house.'	1
	1
"'What,	1
you	1
dig	1
fuller's-earth	1
in	1
the	1
house?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no.	1
This	1
is	1
only	1
where	1
we	1
compress	1
it.	1
But	1
never	1
mind	1
that.	1
All	1
we	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
wrong	1
with	1
it.'	1
	1
"We	1
went	1
upstairs	1
together,	1
the	1
colonel	1
first	1
with	1
the	1
lamp,	1
the	1
fat	1
manager	1
and	1
I	1
behind	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
house,	1
with	1
corridors,	1
passages,	1
narrow	1
winding	1
staircases,	1
and	1
little	1
low	1
doors,	1
the	1
thresholds	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
hollowed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
generations	1
who	1
had	1
crossed	1
them.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
carpets	1
and	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
any	1
furniture	1
above	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
while	1
the	1
plaster	1
was	1
peeling	1
off	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
the	1
damp	1
was	1
breaking	1
through	1
in	1
green,	1
unhealthy	1
blotches.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
as	1
unconcerned	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
warnings	1
of	1
the	1
lady,	1
even	1
though	1
I	1
disregarded	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
kept	1
a	1
keen	1
eye	1
upon	1
my	1
two	1
companions.	1
Ferguson	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
morose	1
and	1
silent	1
man,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
fellow-countryman.	1
	1
"Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
stopped	1
at	1
last	1
before	1
a	1
low	1
door,	1
which	1
he	1
unlocked.	1
Within	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
square	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
us	1
could	1
hardly	1
get	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
Ferguson	1
remained	1
outside,	1
and	1
the	1
colonel	1
ushered	1
me	1
in.	1
	1
"'We	1
are	1
now,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'actually	1
within	1
the	1
hydraulic	1
press,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
particularly	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
for	1
us	1
if	1
anyone	1
were	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
on.	1
The	1
ceiling	1
of	1
this	1
small	1
chamber	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
descending	1
piston,	1
and	1
it	1
comes	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
many	1
tons	1
upon	1
this	1
metal	1
floor.	1
There	1
are	1
small	1
lateral	1
columns	1
of	1
water	1
outside	1
which	1
receive	1
the	1
force,	1
and	1
which	1
transmit	1
and	1
multiply	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
is	1
familiar	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
machine	1
goes	1
readily	1
enough,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
stiffness	1
in	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
lost	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
its	1
force.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
look	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
set	1
it	1
right.'	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
the	1
lamp	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
examined	1
the	1
machine	1
very	1
thoroughly.	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
gigantic	1
one,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
exercising	1
enormous	1
pressure.	1
When	1
I	1
passed	1
outside,	1
however,	1
and	1
pressed	1
down	1
the	1
levers	1
which	1
controlled	1
it,	1
I	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
the	1
whishing	1
sound	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
slight	1
leakage,	1
which	1
allowed	1
a	1
regurgitation	1
of	1
water	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
side	1
cylinders.	1
An	1
examination	1
showed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
india-rubber	1
bands	1
which	1
was	1
round	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
driving-rod	1
had	1
shrunk	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
quite	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
socket	1
along	1
which	1
it	1
worked.	1
This	1
was	1
clearly	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
I	1
pointed	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
companions,	1
who	1
followed	1
my	1
remarks	1
very	1
carefully	1
and	1
asked	1
several	1
practical	1
questions	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
they	1
should	1
proceed	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
right.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
them,	1
I	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
main	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
machine	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
to	1
satisfy	1
my	1
own	1
curiosity.	1
It	1
was	1
obvious	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
fuller's-earth	1
was	1
the	1
merest	1
fabrication,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
absurd	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
so	1
powerful	1
an	1
engine	1
could	1
be	1
designed	1
for	1
so	1
inadequate	1
a	1
purpose.	1
The	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
wood,	1
but	1
the	1
floor	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
iron	1
trough,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
it	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
crust	1
of	1
metallic	1
deposit	1
all	1
over	1
it.	1
I	1
had	1
stooped	1
and	1
was	1
scraping	1
at	1
this	1
to	1
see	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
muttered	1
exclamation	1
in	1
German	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
cadaverous	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
me.	1
	1
"'What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
there?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
felt	1
angry	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
tricked	1
by	1
so	1
elaborate	1
a	1
story	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
me.	1
'I	1
was	1
admiring	1
your	1
fuller's-earth,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
advise	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
machine	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
the	1
exact	1
purpose	1
was	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
used.'	1
	1
"The	1
instant	1
that	1
I	1
uttered	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
regretted	1
the	1
rashness	1
of	1
my	1
speech.	1
His	1
face	1
set	1
hard,	1
and	1
a	1
baleful	1
light	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
grey	1
eyes.	1
	1
"'Very	1
well,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
shall	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
machine.'	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
step	1
backward,	1
slammed	1
the	1
little	1
door,	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
lock.	1
I	1
rushed	1
towards	1
it	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
handle,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
secure,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
my	1
kicks	1
and	1
shoves.	1
'Hullo!'	1
I	1
yelled.	1
'Hullo!	1
Colonel!	1
Let	1
me	1
out!'	1
	1
"And	1
then	1
suddenly	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
which	1
sent	1
my	1
heart	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
clank	1
of	1
the	1
levers	1
and	1
the	1
swish	1
of	1
the	1
leaking	1
cylinder.	1
He	1
had	1
set	1
the	1
engine	1
at	1
work.	1
The	1
lamp	1
still	1
stood	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
it	1
when	1
examining	1
the	1
trough.	1
By	1
its	1
light	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
black	1
ceiling	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
me,	1
slowly,	1
jerkily,	1
but,	1
as	1
none	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
myself,	1
with	1
a	1
force	1
which	1
must	1
within	1
a	1
minute	1
grind	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
shapeless	1
pulp.	1
I	1
threw	1
myself,	1
screaming,	1
against	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
dragged	1
with	1
my	1
nails	1
at	1
the	1
lock.	1
I	1
implored	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
out,	1
but	1
the	1
remorseless	1
clanking	1
of	1
the	1
levers	1
drowned	1
my	1
cries.	1
The	1
ceiling	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
foot	1
or	1
two	1
above	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
hand	1
upraised	1
I	1
could	1
feel	1
its	1
hard,	1
rough	1
surface.	1
Then	1
it	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
would	1
depend	1
very	1
much	1
upon	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
met	1
it.	1
If	1
I	1
lay	1
on	1
my	1
face	1
the	1
weight	1
would	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
spine,	1
and	1
I	1
shuddered	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
snap.	1
Easier	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
perhaps;	1
and	1
yet,	1
had	1
I	1
the	1
nerve	1
to	1
lie	1
and	1
look	1
up	1
at	1
that	1
deadly	1
black	1
shadow	1
wavering	1
down	1
upon	1
me?	1
Already	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stand	1
erect,	1
when	1
my	1
eye	1
caught	1
something	1
which	1
brought	1
a	1
gush	1
of	1
hope	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
floor	1
and	1
ceiling	1
were	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
walls	1
were	1
of	1
wood.	1
As	1
I	1
gave	1
a	1
last	1
hurried	1
glance	1
around,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
thin	1
line	1
of	1
yellow	1
light	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
boards,	1
which	1
broadened	1
and	1
broadened	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
panel	1
was	1
pushed	1
backward.	1
For	1
an	1
instant	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
indeed	1
a	1
door	1
which	1
led	1
away	1
from	1
death.	1
The	1
next	1
instant	1
I	1
threw	1
myself	1
through,	1
and	1
lay	1
half-fainting	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
The	1
panel	1
had	1
closed	1
again	1
behind	1
me,	1
but	1
the	1
crash	1
of	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
afterwards	1
the	1
clang	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
slabs	1
of	1
metal,	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
narrow	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
escape.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
recalled	1
to	1
myself	1
by	1
a	1
frantic	1
plucking	1
at	1
my	1
wrist,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
stone	1
floor	1
of	1
a	1
narrow	1
corridor,	1
while	1
a	1
woman	1
bent	1
over	1
me	1
and	1
tugged	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
left	1
hand,	1
while	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
candle	1
in	1
her	1
right.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
good	1
friend	1
whose	1
warning	1
I	1
had	1
so	1
foolishly	1
rejected.	1
	1
"'Come!	1
come!'	1
she	1
cried	1
breathlessly.	1
'They	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
They	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
there.	1
Oh,	1
do	1
not	1
waste	1
the	1
so-precious	1
time,	1
but	1
come!'	1
	1
"This	1
time,	1
at	1
least,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
scorn	1
her	1
advice.	1
I	1
staggered	1
to	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
her	1
along	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
down	1
a	1
winding	1
stair.	1
The	1
latter	1
led	1
to	1
another	1
broad	1
passage,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
reached	1
it	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
running	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
two	1
voices,	1
one	1
answering	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
the	1
floor	1
on	1
which	1
	1
we	1
were	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
beneath.	1
My	1
guide	1
stopped	1
and	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
like	1
one	1
	1
who	1
is	1
at	1
her	1
wit's	1
end.	1
Then	1
she	1
threw	1
open	1
a	1
door	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
bedroom,	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
shining	1
brightly.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
your	1
only	1
chance,'	1
said	1
she.	1
'It	1
is	1
high,	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
jump	1
it.'	1
	1
"As	1
she	1
spoke	1
a	1
light	1
sprang	1
into	1
view	1
at	1
the	1
further	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
passage,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
lean	1
figure	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark	1
rushing	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
lantern	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
weapon	1
like	1
a	1
butcher's	1
cleaver	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
rushed	1
across	1
the	1
bedroom,	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
looked	1
out.	1
How	1
quiet	1
and	1
sweet	1
and	1
wholesome	1
the	1
garden	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight,	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
feet	1
down.	1
I	1
clambered	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
sill,	1
but	1
I	1
hesitated	1
to	1
jump	1
until	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
my	1
saviour	1
and	1
the	1
ruffian	1
who	1
pursued	1
me.	1
If	1
she	1
were	1
ill-used,	1
then	1
at	1
any	1
risks	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
assistance.	1
The	1
thought	1
had	1
hardly	1
flashed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
pushing	1
his	1
way	1
past	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
threw	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
back.	1
	1
"'Fritz!	1
Fritz!'	1
she	1
cried	1
in	1
English,	1
'remember	1
your	1
promise	1
after	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
You	1
said	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
again.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
silent!	1
Oh,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
silent!'	1
	1
"'You	1
are	1
mad,	1
Elise!'	1
he	1
shouted,	1
struggling	1
to	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
'You	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
us.	1
He	1
has	1
seen	1
too	1
much.	1
Let	1
me	1
pass,	1
I	1
say!'	1
He	1
dashed	1
her	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and,	1
rushing	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
cut	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
his	1
heavy	1
weapon.	1
I	1
had	1
let	1
myself	1
go,	1
and	1
was	1
hanging	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
sill,	1
when	1
his	1
blow	1
fell.	1
I	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
pain,	1
my	1
grip	1
loosened,	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
below.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
shaken	1
but	1
not	1
hurt	1
by	1
the	1
fall;	1
so	1
I	1
picked	1
myself	1
up	1
and	1
rushed	1
off	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
run,	1
for	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
danger	1
yet.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
ran,	1
a	1
deadly	1
dizziness	1
and	1
sickness	1
came	1
over	1
me.	1
I	1
glanced	1
down	1
at	1
my	1
hand,	1
which	1
was	1
throbbing	1
painfully,	1
and	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
saw	1
that	1
my	1
thumb	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
was	1
pouring	1
from	1
my	1
wound.	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
tie	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
round	1
it,	1
but	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sudden	1
buzzing	1
in	1
my	1
ears,	1
and	1
next	1
moment	1
I	1
fell	1
in	1
a	1
dead	1
faint	1
among	1
the	1
rose-bushes.	1
	1
"How	1
long	1
I	1
remained	1
unconscious	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time,	1
for	1
the	1
moon	1
had	1
sunk,	1
and	1
a	1
bright	1
morning	1
was	1
breaking	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
myself.	1
My	1
clothes	1
were	1
all	1
sodden	1
with	1
dew,	1
and	1
my	1
coat-sleeve	1
was	1
drenched	1
with	1
blood	1
from	1
my	1
wounded	1
thumb.	1
The	1
smarting	1
of	1
it	1
recalled	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
my	1
night's	1
adventure,	1
and	1
I	1
sprang	1
to	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
hardly	1
yet	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
my	1
pursuers.	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
astonishment,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
me,	1
neither	1
house	1
nor	1
garden	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
lying	1
in	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
hedge	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
highroad,	1
and	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
down	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
building,	1
which	1
proved,	1
upon	1
my	1
approaching	1
it,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
station	1
at	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
arrived	1
upon	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
ugly	1
wound	1
upon	1
my	1
hand,	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
during	1
those	1
dreadful	1
hours	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
evil	1
dream.	1
	1
"Half	1
dazed,	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
morning	1
train.	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
one	1
to	1
Reading	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
an	1
hour.	1
The	1
same	1
porter	1
was	1
on	1
duty,	1
I	1
found,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
when	1
I	1
arrived.	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Lysander	1
Stark.	1
The	1
name	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
him.	1
Had	1
he	1
observed	1
a	1
carriage	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
waiting	1
for	1
me?	1
No,	1
he	1
had	1
not.	1
Was	1
there	1
a	1
police-station	1
anywhere	1
near?	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
about	1
three	1
miles	1
off.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go,	1
weak	1
and	1
ill	1
as	1
I	1
was.	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
wait	1
until	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
town	1
before	1
telling	1
my	1
story	1
to	1
the	1
police.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
past	1
six	1
when	1
I	1
arrived,	1
so	1
I	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
have	1
my	1
wound	1
dressed,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
doctor	1
was	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
along	1
here.	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
case	1
into	1
your	1
hands	1
and	1
shall	1
do	1
exactly	1
what	1
you	1
advise."	1
	1
We	1
both	1
sat	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
time	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
narrative.	1
Then	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
pulled	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ponderous	1
commonplace	1
books	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
cuttings.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
an	1
advertisement	1
which	1
will	1
interest	1
you,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
appeared	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
ago.	1
Listen	1
to	1
this:	1
'Lost,	1
on	1
the	1
9th	1
inst.,	1
Mr.	1
Jeremiah	1
Hayling,	1
aged	1
twenty-six,	1
a	1
hydraulic	1
engineer.	1
Left	1
his	1
lodgings	1
at	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
at	1
night,	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
heard	1
of	1
since.	1
Was	1
dressed	1
in,'	1
etc.,	1
etc.	1
Ha!	1
That	1
represents	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
needed	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
machine	1
overhauled,	1
I	1
fancy."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
my	1
patient.	1
"Then	1
that	1
explains	1
what	1
the	1
girl	1
said."	1
	1
"Undoubtedly.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
colonel	1
was	1
a	1
cool	1
and	1
desperate	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
absolutely	1
determined	1
that	1
nothing	1
should	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
game,	1
like	1
those	1
out-and-out	1
pirates	1
who	1
will	1
leave	1
no	1
survivor	1
from	1
a	1
captured	1
ship.	1
Well,	1
every	1
moment	1
now	1
is	1
precious,	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
feel	1
equal	1
to	1
it	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Scotland	1
Yard	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
a	1
preliminary	1
to	1
starting	1
for	1
Eyford."	1
	1
Some	1
three	1
hours	1
or	1
so	1
afterwards	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
together,	1
bound	1
from	1
Reading	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
Berkshire	1
village.	1
There	1
were	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
hydraulic	1
engineer,	1
Inspector	1
Bradstreet,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
a	1
plain-clothes	1
man,	1
and	1
myself.	1
Bradstreet	1
had	1
spread	1
an	1
ordnance	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
was	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
compasses	1
drawing	1
a	1
circle	1
with	1
Eyford	1
for	1
its	1
centre.	1
	1
"There	1
you	1
are,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"That	1
circle	1
is	1
drawn	1
at	1
a	1
radius	1
of	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
The	1
place	1
we	1
want	1
must	1
be	1
somewhere	1
near	1
that	1
line.	1
You	1
said	1
ten	1
miles,	1
I	1
think,	1
sir."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
an	1
hour's	1
good	1
drive."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
you	1
back	1
all	1
that	1
way	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
unconscious?"	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
so.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
confused	1
memory,	1
too,	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
lifted	1
and	1
conveyed	1
somewhere."	1
	1
"What	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"is	1
why	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
spared	1
you	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
you	1
lying	1
fainting	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
villain	1
was	1
softened	1
by	1
the	1
woman's	1
entreaties."	1
	1
"I	1
hardly	1
think	1
that	1
likely.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
inexorable	1
face	1
in	1
my	1
life."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
clear	1
up	1
all	1
that,"	1
said	1
Bradstreet.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
drawn	1
my	1
circle,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
I	1
knew	1
at	1
what	1
point	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
folk	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
could	1
lay	1
my	1
finger	1
on	1
it,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
quietly.	1
	1
"Really,	1
now!"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
"you	1
have	1
formed	1
your	1
opinion!	1
Come,	1
now,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
who	1
agrees	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
south,	1
for	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
more	1
deserted	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
say	1
east,"	1
said	1
my	1
patient.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
for	1
west,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
plain-clothes	1
man.	1
"There	1
are	1
several	1
quiet	1
little	1
villages	1
up	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
for	1
north,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"because	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
hills	1
there,	1
and	1
our	1
friend	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
carriage	1
go	1
up	1
any."	1
	1
"Come,"	1
cried	1
the	1
inspector,	1
laughing;	1
"it's	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
diversity	1
of	1
opinion.	1
We	1
have	1
boxed	1
the	1
compass	1
among	1
us.	1
Who	1
do	1
you	1
give	1
your	1
casting	1
vote	1
to?"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
all	1
wrong."	1
	1
"But	1
we	1
can't	1
all	1
be."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
you	1
can.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
point."	1
He	1
placed	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
circle.	1
"This	1
is	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
them."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
twelve-mile	1
drive?"	1
gasped	1
Hatherley.	1
	1
"Six	1
out	1
and	1
six	1
back.	1
Nothing	1
simpler.	1
You	1
say	1
yourself	1
that	1
the	1
horse	1
was	1
fresh	1
and	1
glossy	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
in.	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
twelve	1
miles	1
over	1
heavy	1
roads?"	1
	1
"Indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
likely	1
ruse	1
enough,"	1
observed	1
Bradstreet	1
thoughtfully.	1
"Of	1
course	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
this	1
gang."	1
	1
"None	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"They	1
are	1
coiners	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale,	1
and	1
have	1
used	1
the	1
machine	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
amalgam	1
which	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
silver."	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
known	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
that	1
a	1
clever	1
gang	1
was	1
at	1
work,"	1
said	1
the	1
inspector.	1
"They	1
have	1
been	1
turning	1
out	1
half-crowns	1
by	1
the	1
thousand.	1
We	1
even	1
traced	1
them	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Reading,	1
but	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
farther,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
covered	1
their	1
traces	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
old	1
hands.	1
But	1
now,	1
thanks	1
to	1
this	1
lucky	1
chance,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
right	1
enough."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
inspector	1
was	1
mistaken,	1
for	1
those	1
criminals	1
were	1
not	1
destined	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
justice.	1
As	1
we	1
rolled	1
into	1
Eyford	1
Station	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
gigantic	1
column	1
of	1
smoke	1
which	1
streamed	1
up	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
small	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
and	1
hung	1
like	1
an	1
immense	1
ostrich	1
feather	1
over	1
the	1
landscape.	1
	1
"A	1
house	1
on	1
fire?"	1
asked	1
Bradstreet	1
as	1
the	1
train	1
steamed	1
off	1
again	1
on	1
its	1
way.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir!"	1
said	1
the	1
station-master.	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
it	1
break	1
out?"	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
sir,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
got	1
worse,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
blaze."	1
	1
"Whose	1
house	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Dr.	1
Becher's."	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,"	1
broke	1
in	1
the	1
engineer,	1
"is	1
Dr.	1
Becher	1
a	1
German,	1
very	1
thin,	1
with	1
a	1
long,	1
sharp	1
nose?"	1
	1
The	1
station-master	1
laughed	1
heartily.	1
"No,	1
sir,	1
Dr.	1
Becher	1
is	1
an	1
Englishman,	1
and	1
there	1
isn't	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
parish	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
better-lined	1
waistcoat.	1
But	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
gentleman	1
staying	1
with	1
him,	1
a	1
patient,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
and	1
he	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
little	1
good	1
Berkshire	1
beef	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
harm."	1
	1
The	1
station-master	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
his	1
speech	1
before	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
hastening	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
The	1
road	1
topped	1
a	1
low	1
hill,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
widespread	1
whitewashed	1
building	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us,	1
spouting	1
fire	1
at	1
every	1
chink	1
and	1
window,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
in	1
front	1
three	1
fire-engines	1
were	1
vainly	1
striving	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
flames	1
under.	1
	1
"That's	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Hatherley,	1
in	1
intense	1
excitement.	1
"There	1
is	1
the	1
gravel-drive,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
rose-bushes	1
where	1
I	1
lay.	1
That	1
second	1
window	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
jumped	1
from."	1
	1
"Well,	1
at	1
least,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"you	1
have	1
had	1
your	1
revenge	1
upon	1
them.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
oil-lamp	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
crushed	1
in	1
the	1
press,	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
wooden	1
walls,	1
though	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
excited	1
in	1
the	1
chase	1
after	1
you	1
to	1
observe	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
Now	1
keep	1
your	1
eyes	1
open	1
in	1
this	1
crowd	1
for	1
your	1
friends	1
of	1
last	1
night,	1
though	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
fear	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
hundred	1
miles	1
off	1
by	1
now."	1
	1
And	1
Holmes'	1
fears	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
realised,	1
for	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
this	1
no	1
word	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
heard	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
woman,	1
the	1
sinister	1
German,	1
or	1
the	1
morose	1
Englishman.	1
Early	1
that	1
morning	1
a	1
peasant	1
had	1
met	1
a	1
cart	1
containing	1
several	1
people	1
and	1
some	1
very	1
bulky	1
boxes	1
driving	1
rapidly	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Reading,	1
but	1
there	1
all	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
fugitives	1
disappeared,	1
and	1
even	1
Holmes'	1
ingenuity	1
failed	1
ever	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
least	1
clue	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
whereabouts.	1
	1
The	1
firemen	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
perturbed	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
arrangements	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
within,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
by	1
discovering	1
a	1
newly	1
severed	1
human	1
thumb	1
upon	1
a	1
window-sill	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
floor.	1
About	1
sunset,	1
however,	1
their	1
efforts	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
successful,	1
and	1
they	1
subdued	1
the	1
flames,	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
roof	1
had	1
fallen	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
such	1
absolute	1
ruin	1
that,	1
save	1
some	1
twisted	1
cylinders	1
and	1
iron	1
piping,	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
remained	1
of	1
the	1
machinery	1
which	1
had	1
cost	1
our	1
unfortunate	1
acquaintance	1
so	1
dearly.	1
Large	1
masses	1
of	1
nickel	1
and	1
of	1
tin	1
were	1
discovered	1
stored	1
in	1
an	1
out-house,	1
but	1
no	1
coins	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
explained	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
those	1
bulky	1
boxes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
referred	1
to.	1
	1
How	1
our	1
hydraulic	1
engineer	1
had	1
been	1
conveyed	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
recovered	1
his	1
senses	1
might	1
have	1
remained	1
forever	1
a	1
mystery	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
soft	1
mould,	1
which	1
told	1
us	1
a	1
very	1
plain	1
tale.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
carried	1
down	1
by	1
two	1
persons,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
remarkably	1
small	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
unusually	1
large	1
ones.	1
On	1
the	1
whole,	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
silent	1
Englishman,	1
being	1
less	1
bold	1
or	1
less	1
murderous	1
than	1
his	1
companion,	1
had	1
assisted	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
unconscious	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
danger.	1
	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
our	1
engineer	1
ruefully	1
as	1
we	1
took	1
our	1
seats	1
to	1
return	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
London,	1
"it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
pretty	1
business	1
for	1
me!	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
thumb	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
a	1
fifty-guinea	1
fee,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
gained?"	1
	1
"Experience,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"Indirectly	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
value,	1
you	1
know;	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
words	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
excellent	1
company	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
your	1
existence."	1
	1
	1
	1
X.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
NOBLE	1
BACHELOR	1
	1
The	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
marriage,	1
and	1
its	1
curious	1
termination,	1
have	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
interest	1
in	1
those	1
exalted	1
circles	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
bridegroom	1
moves.	1
Fresh	1
scandals	1
have	1
eclipsed	1
it,	1
and	1
their	1
more	1
piquant	1
details	1
have	1
drawn	1
the	1
gossips	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
four-year-old	1
drama.	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
believe,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
facts	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
revealed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
public,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
friend	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
a	1
considerable	1
share	1
in	1
clearing	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
no	1
memoir	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
be	1
complete	1
without	1
some	1
little	1
sketch	1
of	1
this	1
remarkable	1
episode.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
before	1
my	1
own	1
marriage,	1
during	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
sharing	1
rooms	1
with	1
Holmes	1
in	1
Baker	1
Street,	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
home	1
from	1
an	1
afternoon	1
stroll	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
letter	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
I	1
had	1
remained	1
indoors	1
all	1
day,	1
for	1
the	1
weather	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
sudden	1
turn	1
to	1
rain,	1
with	1
high	1
autumnal	1
winds,	1
and	1
the	1
Jezail	1
bullet	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
brought	1
back	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
limbs	1
as	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
my	1
Afghan	1
campaign	1
throbbed	1
with	1
dull	1
persistence.	1
With	1
my	1
body	1
in	1
one	1
easy-chair	1
and	1
my	1
legs	1
upon	1
another,	1
I	1
had	1
surrounded	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
newspapers	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
saturated	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
I	1
tossed	1
them	1
all	1
aside	1
and	1
lay	1
listless,	1
watching	1
the	1
huge	1
crest	1
and	1
monogram	1
upon	1
the	1
envelope	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
wondering	1
lazily	1
who	1
my	1
friend's	1
noble	1
correspondent	1
could	1
be.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
fashionable	1
epistle,"	1
I	1
remarked	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
"Your	1
morning	1
letters,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
were	1
from	1
a	1
fish-monger	1
and	1
a	1
tide-waiter."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
correspondence	1
has	1
certainly	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
variety,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
smiling,	1
"and	1
the	1
humbler	1
are	1
usually	1
the	1
more	1
interesting.	1
This	1
looks	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
unwelcome	1
social	1
summonses	1
which	1
call	1
upon	1
a	1
man	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
bored	1
or	1
to	1
lie."	1
	1
He	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
and	1
glanced	1
over	1
the	1
contents.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
come,	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
of	1
interest,	1
after	1
all."	1
	1
"Not	1
social,	1
then?"	1
	1
"No,	1
distinctly	1
professional."	1
	1
"And	1
from	1
a	1
noble	1
client?"	1
	1
"One	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
in	1
England."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
assure	1
you,	1
Watson,	1
without	1
affectation,	1
that	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
my	1
client	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
less	1
moment	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
case.	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
possible,	1
however,	1
that	1
that	1
also	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
this	1
new	1
investigation.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
reading	1
the	1
papers	1
diligently	1
of	1
late,	1
have	1
you	1
not?"	1
	1
"It	1
looks	1
like	1
it,"	1
said	1
I	1
ruefully,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
huge	1
bundle	1
in	1
the	1
corner.	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
perhaps	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
post	1
me	1
up.	1
I	1
read	1
nothing	1
except	1
the	1
criminal	1
news	1
and	1
the	1
agony	1
column.	1
The	1
latter	1
is	1
always	1
instructive.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
followed	1
recent	1
events	1
so	1
closely	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
read	1
about	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
and	1
his	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
with	1
the	1
deepest	1
interest."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
The	1
letter	1
which	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
is	1
from	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
you	1
must	1
turn	1
over	1
these	1
papers	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
whatever	1
bears	1
upon	1
the	1
matter.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
says:	1
	1
"'MY	1
DEAR	1
MR.	1
SHERLOCK	1
HOLMES:--Lord	1
Backwater	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
place	1
implicit	1
reliance	1
upon	1
your	1
judgment	1
and	1
discretion.	1
I	1
have	1
determined,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
and	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
painful	1
event	1
which	1
has	1
occurred	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
my	1
wedding.	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
is	1
acting	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
he	1
assures	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
sees	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
your	1
co-operation,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
thinks	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
assistance.	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
at	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
and,	1
should	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
other	1
engagement	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
postpone	1
it,	1
as	1
this	1
matter	1
is	1
of	1
paramount	1
importance.	1
Yours	1
faithfully,	1
ST.	1
SIMON.'	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dated	1
from	1

the	1
noble	1
lord	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
smear	1
of	1
ink	1
upon	1
the	1
outer	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
little	1
finger,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
as	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
epistle.	1
	1
"He	1
says	1
four	1
o'clock.	1
It	1
is	1
three	1
now.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
an	1
hour."	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
time,	1
with	1
your	1
assistance,	1
to	1
get	1
clear	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
Turn	1
over	1
those	1
papers	1
and	1
arrange	1
the	1
extracts	1
in	1
their	1
order	1
of	1
time,	1
while	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
glance	1
as	1
to	1
who	1
our	1
client	1
is."	1
He	1
picked	1
a	1
red-covered	1
volume	1
from	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
reference	1
beside	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
"Here	1
he	1
is,"	1
said	1
he,	1
sitting	1
down	1
and	1
flattening	1
it	1
out	1
upon	1
his	1
knee.	1
"'Lord	1
Robert	1
Walsingham	1

Vere	1

second	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1

Hum!	1
'Arms:	1

three	1
caltrops	1

1846.'	1
He's	1
forty-one	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
which	1
is	1
mature	1
for	1
marriage.	1

Under-Secretary	1
for	1
the	1

in	1
a	1
late	1

The	1

Ha!	1
Well,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
very	1
instructive	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
Watson,	1
for	1
something	1
more	1
solid."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
what	1
I	1
want,"	1
said	1
I,	1
"for	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
quite	1
recent,	1
and	1
the	1
matter	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
remarkable.	1
I	1
feared	1
to	1
refer	1
them	1
to	1
you,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
an	1
inquiry	1
on	1
hand	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
disliked	1
the	1
intrusion	1
of	1
other	1

	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
mean	1
the	1
little	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
Grosvenor	1
Square	1

That	1
is	1
quite	1
cleared	1
up	1
now--though,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
Pray	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
your	1

	1
"Here	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
notice	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
find.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
column	1
of	1
the	1
Morning	1

dates,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
some	1
weeks	1
back:	1
'A	1

has	1
been	1
arranged,'	1
it	1
says,	1
'and	1
will,	1
if	1
rumour	1
is	1

place,	1
between	1

daughter	1
of	1
Aloysius	1
Doran.	1
Esq.,	1
of	1
San	1
Francisco,	1
Cal.,	1
U.S.A.'	1
That	1
is	1
all."	1
	1
"Terse	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
point,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes,	1
stretching	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
legs	1
towards	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
paragraph	1
amplifying	1
this	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
papers	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
week.	1
Ah,	1
here	1
it	1
is:	1
'There	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
call	1
for	1
protection	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
market,	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
free-trade	1
principle	1
appears	1
to	1
tell	1
heavily	1
against	1
our	1
home	1
product.	1
One	1
by	1
one	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
houses	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
passing	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
our	1
fair	1
cousins	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
Atlantic.	1
An	1
important	1
addition	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
prizes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
these	1
charming	1
invaders.	1
Lord	1
St.	1

who	1
has	1
shown	1
himself	1
for	1
over	1
twenty	1
years	1
proof	1
against	1
the	1
little	1
god's	1
arrows,	1
has	1
now	1
definitely	1
announced	1
his	1
approaching	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
Hatty	1
Doran,	1
the	1
fascinating	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
California	1
millionaire.	1
Miss	1
Doran,	1
whose	1
graceful	1
figure	1
and	1
striking	1
face	1
attracted	1
much	1
attention	1
at	1
the	1
Westbury	1
House	1
festivities,	1
is	1
an	1
only	1
child,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
currently	1
reported	1
that	1
her	1
dowry	1
will	1
run	1
to	1
considerably	1
over	1
the	1
six	1
figures,	1
with	1
expectancies	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
secret	1
that	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Balmoral	1
has	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
pictures	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and	1
as	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
no	1
property	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
save	1
the	1
small	1
estate	1
of	1
Birchmoor,	1
it	1
is	1
obvious	1
that	1
the	1
Californian	1
heiress	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
gainer	1
by	1
an	1
alliance	1
which	1
will	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
easy	1
and	1
common	1
transition	1
from	1
a	1
Republican	1
lady	1
to	1
a	1
British	1
peeress.'"	1
	1
"Anything	1
else?"	1
asked	1
Holmes,	1
yawning.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes;	1
plenty.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
note	1
in	1
the	1
Morning	1
Post	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
marriage	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
absolutely	1
quiet	1
one,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
St.	1
George's,	1
Hanover	1
Square,	1
that	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
intimate	1
friends	1
would	1
be	1
invited,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
party	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
furnished	1
house	1
at	1
Lancaster	1
Gate	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran.	1
Two	1
days	1
later--that	1
is,	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
last--there	1
is	1
a	1
curt	1
announcement	1
that	1
the	1
wedding	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
honeymoon	1
would	1
be	1
passed	1
at	1
Lord	1
Backwater's	1
place,	1
near	1
Petersfield.	1
Those	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
notices	1
which	1
appeared	1
before	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride."	1
	1
"Before	1
the	1
what?"	1
asked	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
start.	1
	1
"The	1
vanishing	1
of	1
the	1
lady."	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
she	1
vanish,	1
then?"	1
	1
"At	1
the	1
wedding	1
breakfast."	1
	1
"Indeed.	1
This	1
is	1
more	1
interesting	1
than	1
it	1
promised	1
to	1
be;	1
quite	1
dramatic,	1
in	1
fact."	1
	1
"Yes;	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common."	1
	1
"They	1
often	1
vanish	1
before	1
the	1
ceremony,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
during	1
the	1
honeymoon;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
anything	1
quite	1
so	1
prompt	1
as	1
this.	1
Pray	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
the	1
details."	1
	1
"I	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
incomplete."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
make	1
them	1
less	1
so."	1
	1
"Such	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
they	1
are	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
article	1
of	1
a	1
morning	1
paper	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
to	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
headed,	1
'Singular	1
Occurrence	1
at	1
a	1
Fashionable	1
Wedding':	1
	1
"'The	1
family	1
of	1
Lord	1
Robert	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
been	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
greatest	1
consternation	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
and	1
painful	1
episodes	1
which	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
wedding.	1
The	1
ceremony,	1
as	1
shortly	1
announced	1
in	1
the	1
papers	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
occurred	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
morning;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
possible	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
strange	1
rumours	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
persistently	1
floating	1
about.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
attempts	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
to	1
hush	1
the	1
matter	1
up,	1
so	1
much	1
public	1
attention	1
has	1
now	1
been	1
drawn	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
no	1
good	1
purpose	1
can	1
be	1
served	1
by	1
affecting	1
to	1
disregard	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
subject	1
for	1
conversation.	1
	1
"'The	1
ceremony,	1
which	1
was	1
performed	1
at	1
St.	1
George's,	1
Hanover	1
Square,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
quiet	1
one,	1
no	1
one	1
being	1
present	1
save	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
the	1
Duchess	1
of	1
Balmoral,	1
Lord	1
Backwater,	1
Lord	1
Eustace	1
and	1
Lady	1
Clara	1
St.	1
Simon	1
(the	1
younger	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom),	1
and	1
Lady	1
Alicia	1
Whittington.	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
proceeded	1
afterwards	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
at	1
Lancaster	1
Gate,	1
where	1
breakfast	1
had	1
been	1
prepared.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
some	1
little	1
trouble	1
was	1
caused	1
by	1
a	1
woman,	1
whose	1
name	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
ascertained,	1
who	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
after	1
the	1
bridal	1
party,	1
alleging	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
claim	1
upon	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
after	1
a	1
painful	1
and	1
prolonged	1
scene	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
ejected	1
by	1
the	1
butler	1
and	1
the	1
footman.	1
The	1
bride,	1
who	1
had	1
fortunately	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
this	1
unpleasant	1
interruption,	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
when	1
she	1
complained	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
indisposition	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
her	1
room.	1
Her	1
prolonged	1
absence	1
having	1
caused	1
some	1
comment,	1
her	1
father	1
followed	1
her,	1
but	1
learned	1
from	1
her	1
maid	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
chamber	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
caught	1
up	1
an	1
ulster	1
and	1
bonnet,	1
and	1
hurried	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
passage.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
lady	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
thus	1
apparelled,	1
but	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
credit	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
mistress,	1
believing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
On	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
his	1
daughter	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
Mr.	1
Aloysius	1
Doran,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
instantly	1
put	1
themselves	1
in	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
police,	1
and	1
very	1
energetic	1
inquiries	1
are	1
being	1
made,	1
which	1
will	1
probably	1
result	1
in	1
a	1
speedy	1
clearing	1
up	1
of	1
this	1
very	1
singular	1
business.	1
Up	1
to	1
a	1
late	1
hour	1
last	1
night,	1
however,	1
nothing	1
had	1
transpired	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
whereabouts	1
of	1
the	1
missing	1
lady.	1
There	1
are	1
rumours	1
of	1
foul	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
police	1
have	1
caused	1
the	1
arrest	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
original	1
disturbance,	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that,	1
from	1
jealousy	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
motive,	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
strange	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride.'"	1
	1
"And	1
is	1
that	1
all?"	1
	1
"Only	1
one	1
little	1
item	1
in	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
papers,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
suggestive	1
one."	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
is--"	1
	1
"That	1
Miss	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
caused	1
the	1
disturbance,	1
has	1
actually	1
been	1
arrested.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
formerly	1
a	1
danseuse	1
at	1
the	1
Allegro,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
known	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
for	1
some	1
years.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
further	1
particulars,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
case	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
now--so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
press."	1
	1
"And	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
interesting	1
case	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
missed	1
it	1
for	1
worlds.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
bell,	1
Watson,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
clock	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
four,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
noble	1
client.	1
Do	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
going,	1
Watson,	1
for	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
prefer	1
having	1
a	1
witness,	1
if	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
check	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
memory."	1
	1
"Lord	1
Robert	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
announced	1
our	1
page-boy,	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
door.	1
A	1
gentleman	1
entered,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant,	1
cultured	1
face,	1
high-nosed	1
and	1
pale,	1
with	1
something	1
perhaps	1
of	1
petulance	1
about	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
steady,	1
well-opened	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
pleasant	1
lot	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
obeyed.	1
His	1
manner	1
was	1
brisk,	1
and	1
yet	1
his	1
general	1
appearance	1
gave	1
an	1
undue	1
impression	1
of	1
age,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
slight	1
forward	1
stoop	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
knees	1
as	1
he	1
walked.	1
His	1
hair,	1
too,	1
as	1
he	1
swept	1
off	1
his	1
very	1
curly-brimmed	1
hat,	1
was	1
grizzled	1
round	1
the	1
edges	1
and	1
thin	1
upon	1
the	1
top.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
dress,	1
it	1
was	1
careful	1
to	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
foppishness,	1
with	1
high	1
collar,	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
white	1
waistcoat,	1
yellow	1
gloves,	1
patent-leather	1
shoes,	1
and	1
light-coloured	1
gaiters.	1
He	1
advanced	1
slowly	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
turning	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
left	1
to	1
right,	1
and	1
swinging	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
the	1
cord	1
which	1
held	1
his	1
golden	1
eyeglasses.	1
	1
"Good-day,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rising	1
and	1
bowing.	1
"Pray	1
take	1
the	1
basket-chair.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
colleague,	1
Dr.	1
Watson.	1
Draw	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
this	1
matter	1
over."	1
	1
"A	1
most	1
painful	1
matter	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
most	1
readily	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
managed	1
several	1
delicate	1
cases	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
sir,	1
though	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
hardly	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
of	1
society."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
descending."	1
	1
"I	1
beg	1
pardon."	1
	1
"My	1
last	1
client	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
was	1
a	1
king."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
really!	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea.	1
And	1
which	1
king?"	1
	1
"The	1
King	1
of	1
Scandinavia."	1
	1
"What!	1
Had	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
wife?"	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
suavely,	1
"that	1
I	1
extend	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
my	1
other	1
clients	1
the	1
same	1
secrecy	1
which	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
yours."	1
	1
"Of	1
course!	1
Very	1
right!	1
very	1
right!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
I	1
beg	1
pardon.	1
As	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
case,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
information	1
which	1
may	1
assist	1
you	1
in	1
forming	1
an	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
learned	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
prints,	1
nothing	1
more.	1
I	1
presume	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
correct--this	1
article,	1
for	1
example,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
the	1
bride."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
glanced	1
over	1
it.	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
correct,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
goes."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
needs	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
supplementing	1
before	1
anyone	1
could	1
offer	1
an	1
opinion.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
arrive	1
at	1
my	1
facts	1
most	1
directly	1
by	1
questioning	1
you."	1
	1
"Pray	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
you	1
first	1
meet	1
Miss	1
Hatty	1
Doran?"	1
	1
"In	1
San	1
Francisco,	1
a	1
year	1
ago."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
travelling	1
in	1
the	1
States?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Did	1
you	1
become	1
engaged	1
then?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
friendly	1
footing?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
amused	1
by	1
her	1
society,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
amused."	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich?"	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
richest	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
Pacific	1
slope."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
did	1
he	1
make	1
his	1
money?"	1
	1
"In	1
mining.	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago.	1
Then	1
he	1
struck	1
gold,	1
invested	1
it,	1
and	1
came	1
up	1
by	1
leaps	1
and	1
bounds."	1
	1
"Now,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
impression	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady's--your	1
wife's	1
character?"	1
	1
The	1
nobleman	1
swung	1
his	1
glasses	1
a	1
little	1
faster	1
and	1
stared	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
"You	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"my	1
wife	1
was	1
twenty	1
before	1
her	1
father	1
became	1
a	1
rich	1
man.	1
During	1
that	1
time	1
she	1
ran	1
free	1
in	1
a	1
mining	1
camp	1
and	1
wandered	1
through	1
woods	1
or	1
mountains,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
education	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Nature	1
rather	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
schoolmaster.	1
She	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
in	1
England	1
a	1
tomboy,	1
with	1
a	1
strong	1
nature,	1
wild	1
and	1
free,	1
unfettered	1
by	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
traditions.	1
She	1
is	1
impetuous--volcanic,	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say.	1
She	1
is	1
swift	1
in	1
making	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
and	1
fearless	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
her	1
resolutions.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
the	1
name	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
to	1
bear"--he	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
stately	1
cough--"had	1
not	1
I	1
thought	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
bottom	1
a	1
noble	1
woman.	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
heroic	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
that	1
anything	1
dishonourable	1
would	1
be	1
repugnant	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
her	1
photograph?"	1
	1
"I	1
brought	1
this	1
with	1
me."	1
He	1
opened	1
a	1
locket	1
and	1
showed	1
us	1
the	1
full	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
lovely	1
woman.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
photograph	1
but	1
an	1
ivory	1
miniature,	1
and	1
the	1
artist	1
had	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
full	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
lustrous	1
black	1
hair,	1
the	1
large	1
dark	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
exquisite	1
mouth.	1
Holmes	1
gazed	1
long	1
and	1
earnestly	1
at	1
it.	1
Then	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
locket	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon.	1
	1
"The	1
young	1
lady	1
came	1
to	1
London,	1
then,	1
and	1
you	1
renewed	1
your	1
acquaintance?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
her	1
father	1
brought	1
her	1
over	1
for	1
this	1
last	1
London	1
season.	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
several	1
times,	1
became	1
engaged	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
have	1
now	1
married	1
her."	1
	1
"She	1
brought,	1
I	1
understand,	1
a	1
considerable	1
dowry?"	1
	1
"A	1
fair	1
dowry.	1
Not	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
my	1
family."	1
	1
"And	1
this,	1
of	1
course,	1
remains	1
to	1
you,	1
since	1
the	1
marriage	1
is	1
a	1
fait	1
accompli?"	1
	1
"I	1
really	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
subject."	1
	1
"Very	1
naturally	1
not.	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
Miss	1
Doran	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Was	1
she	1
in	1
good	1
spirits?"	1
	1
"Never	1
better.	1
She	1
kept	1
talking	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
in	1
our	1
future	1
lives."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
That	1
is	1
very	1
interesting.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
wedding?"	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
possible--at	1
least	1
until	1
after	1
the	1
ceremony."	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
observe	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
then?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
saw	1
then	1
the	1
first	1
signs	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
that	1
her	1
temper	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
sharp.	1
The	1
incident	1
however,	1
was	1
too	1
trivial	1
to	1
relate	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
possible	1
bearing	1
upon	1
the	1
case."	1
	1
"Pray	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
it,	1
for	1
all	1
that."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
childish.	1
She	1
dropped	1
her	1
bouquet	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
vestry.	1
She	1
was	1
passing	1
the	1
front	1
pew	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
pew.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
moment's	1
delay,	1
but	1
the	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
pew	1
handed	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
fall.	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
she	1
answered	1
me	1
abruptly;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
home,	1
she	1
seemed	1
absurdly	1
agitated	1
over	1
this	1
trifling	1
cause."	1
	1
"Indeed!	1
You	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
the	1
pew.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
were	1
present,	1
then?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
exclude	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
church	1
is	1
open."	1
	1
"This	1
gentleman	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
wife's	1
friends?"	1
	1
"No,	1
no;	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
a	1
gentleman	1
by	1
courtesy,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
common-looking	1
person.	1
I	1
hardly	1
noticed	1
his	1
appearance.	1
But	1
really	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
wandering	1
rather	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
point."	1
	1
"Lady	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
then,	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
wedding	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
cheerful	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
it.	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
do	1
on	1
re-entering	1
her	1
father's	1
house?"	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
maid."	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
her	1
maid?"	1
	1
"Alice	1
is	1
her	1
name.	1
She	1
is	1
an	1
American	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
California	1
with	1
her."	1
	1
"A	1
confidential	1
servant?"	1
	1
"A	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
so.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
liberties.	1
Still,	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
America	1
they	1
look	1
upon	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
way."	1
	1
"How	1
long	1
did	1
she	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
Alice?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
a	1
few	1
minutes.	1
I	1
had	1
something	1
else	1
to	1
think	1
of."	1
	1
"You	1
did	1
not	1
overhear	1
what	1
they	1
said?"	1
	1
"Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
said	1
something	1
about	1
'jumping	1
a	1
claim.'	1
She	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
use	1
slang	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
what	1
she	1
meant."	1
	1
"American	1
slang	1
is	1
very	1
expressive	1
sometimes.	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
your	1
wife	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
maid?"	1
	1
"She	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-room."	1
	1
"On	1
your	1
arm?"	1
	1
"No,	1
alone.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
independent	1
in	1
little	1
matters	1
like	1
that.	1
Then,	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes	1
or	1
so,	1
she	1
rose	1
hurriedly,	1
muttered	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
apology,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
never	1
came	1
back."	1
	1
"But	1
this	1
maid,	1
Alice,	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
deposes	1
that	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
covered	1
her	1
bride's	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
ulster,	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
bonnet,	1
and	1
went	1
out."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
afterwards	1
seen	1
walking	1
into	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
custody,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
a	1
disturbance	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Doran's	1
house	1
that	1
morning."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
a	1
few	1
particulars	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
"We	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
a	1
friendly	1
footing	1
for	1
some	1
years--I	1
may	1
say	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
friendly	1
footing.	1
She	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Allegro.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
treated	1
her	1
ungenerously,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
just	1
cause	1
of	1
complaint	1
against	1
me,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
women	1
are,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Flora	1
was	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
thing,	1
but	1
exceedingly	1
hot-headed	1
and	1
devotedly	1
attached	1
to	1
me.	1
She	1
wrote	1
me	1
dreadful	1
letters	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
married,	1
and,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
marriage	1
celebrated	1
so	1
quietly	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
feared	1
lest	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
scandal	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
She	1
came	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Doran's	1
door	1
just	1
after	1
we	1
returned,	1
and	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
push	1
her	1
way	1
in,	1
uttering	1
very	1
abusive	1
expressions	1
towards	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
even	1
threatening	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
foreseen	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
two	1
police	1
fellows	1
there	1
in	1
private	1
clothes,	1
who	1
soon	1
pushed	1
her	1
out	1
again.	1
She	1
was	1
quiet	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
row."	1
	1
"Did	1
your	1
wife	1
hear	1
all	1
this?"	1
	1
"No,	1
thank	1
goodness,	1
she	1
did	1
not."	1
	1
"And	1
she	1
was	1
seen	1
walking	1
with	1
this	1
very	1
woman	1
afterwards?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade,	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard,	1
looks	1
upon	1
as	1
so	1
serious.	1
It	1
is	1
thought	1
that	1
Flora	1
decoyed	1
my	1
wife	1
out	1
and	1
laid	1
some	1
terrible	1
trap	1
for	1
her."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
possible	1
supposition."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so,	1
too?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
probable	1
one.	1
But	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
yourself	1
look	1
upon	1
this	1
as	1
likely?"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Flora	1
would	1
hurt	1
a	1
fly."	1
	1
"Still,	1
jealousy	1
is	1
a	1
strange	1
transformer	1
of	1
characters.	1
Pray	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
theory	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
took	1
place?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
seek	1
a	1
theory,	1
not	1
to	1
propound	1
one.	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
facts.	1
Since	1
you	1
ask	1
me,	1
however,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
this	1
affair,	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
so	1
immense	1
a	1
social	1
stride,	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
causing	1
some	1
little	1
nervous	1
disturbance	1
in	1
my	1
wife."	1
	1
"In	1
short,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
suddenly	1
deranged?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
when	1
I	1
consider	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
turned	1
her	1
back--I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
upon	1
me,	1
but	1
upon	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
many	1
have	1
aspired	1
to	1
without	1
success--I	1
can	1
hardly	1
explain	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
fashion."	1
	1
"Well,	1
certainly	1
that	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
conceivable	1
hypothesis,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling.	1
"And	1
now,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nearly	1
all	1
my	1
data.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
you	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
breakfast-table	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window?"	1
	1
"We	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
the	1
Park."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
Then	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
need	1
to	1
detain	1
you	1
longer.	1
I	1
shall	1
communicate	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"Should	1
you	1
be	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
solve	1
this	1
problem,"	1
said	1
our	1
client,	1
rising.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
solved	1
it."	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What	1
was	1
that?"	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
solved	1
it."	1
	1
"Where,	1
then,	1
is	1
my	1
wife?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
detail	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
speedily	1
supply."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
take	1
wiser	1
heads	1
than	1
yours	1
or	1
mine,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
and	1
bowing	1
in	1
a	1
stately,	1
old-fashioned	1
manner	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
to	1
honour	1
my	1
head	1
by	1
putting	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
his	1
own,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
whisky	1
and	1
soda	1
and	1
a	1
cigar	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
cross-questioning.	1
I	1
had	1
formed	1
my	1
conclusions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
our	1
client	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Holmes!"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
notes	1
of	1
several	1
similar	1
cases,	1
though	1
none,	1
as	1
I	1
remarked	1
before,	1
which	1
were	1
quite	1
as	1
prompt.	1
My	1
whole	1
examination	1
served	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
conjecture	1
into	1
a	1
certainty.	1
Circumstantial	1
evidence	1
is	1
occasionally	1
very	1
convincing,	1
as	1
when	1
you	1
find	1
a	1
trout	1
in	1
the	1
milk,	1
to	1
quote	1
Thoreau's	1
example."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
heard."	1
	1
"Without,	1
however,	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
pre-existing	1
cases	1
which	1
serves	1
me	1
so	1
well.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
parallel	1
instance	1
in	1
Aberdeen	1
some	1
years	1
back,	1
and	1
something	1
on	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
lines	1
at	1
Munich	1
the	1
year	1
after	1
the	1
Franco-Prussian	1
War.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
cases--but,	1
hullo,	1
here	1
is	1
Lestrade!	1
Good-afternoon,	1
Lestrade!	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
an	1
extra	1
tumbler	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
cigars	1
in	1
the	1
box."	1
	1
The	1
official	1
detective	1
was	1
attired	1
in	1
a	1
pea-jacket	1
and	1
cravat,	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
decidedly	1
nautical	1
appearance,	1
and	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
black	1
canvas	1
bag	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
With	1
a	1
short	1
greeting	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
and	1
lit	1
the	1
cigar	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
up,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes	1
with	1
a	1
twinkle	1
in	1
his	1
eye.	1
"You	1
look	1
dissatisfied."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
feel	1
dissatisfied.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
infernal	1
St.	1
Simon	1
marriage	1
case.	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
neither	1
head	1
nor	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
business."	1
	1
"Really!	1
You	1
surprise	1
me."	1
	1
"Who	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mixed	1
affair?	1
Every	1
clue	1
seems	1
to	1
slip	1
through	1
my	1
fingers.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
work	1
upon	1
it	1
all	1
day."	1
	1
"And	1
very	1
wet	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
you,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
pea-jacket.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
dragging	1
the	1
Serpentine."	1
	1
"In	1
heaven's	1
name,	1
what	1
for?"	1
	1
"In	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
laughed	1
heartily.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
dragged	1
the	1
basin	1
of	1
Trafalgar	1
Square	1
fountain?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Why?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
	1
"Because	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
finding	1
this	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
shot	1
an	1
angry	1
glance	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
"I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it,"	1
he	1
snarled.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
just	1
heard	1
the	1
facts,	1
but	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!	1
Then	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Serpentine	1
plays	1
no	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
matter?"	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
it	1
very	1
unlikely."	1
	1
"Then	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
kindly	1
explain	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
we	1
found	1
this	1
in	1
it?"	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
bag	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
and	1
tumbled	1
onto	1
the	1
floor	1
a	1
wedding-dress	1
of	1
watered	1
silk,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
white	1
satin	1
shoes	1
and	1
a	1
bride's	1
wreath	1
and	1
veil,	1
all	1
discoloured	1
and	1
soaked	1
in	1
water.	1
"There,"	1
said	1
he,	1
putting	1
a	1
new	1
wedding-ring	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
pile.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
nut	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
crack,	1
Master	1
Holmes."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
my	1
friend,	1
blowing	1
blue	1
rings	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
"You	1
dragged	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
Serpentine?"	1
	1
"No.	1
They	1
were	1
found	1
floating	1
near	1
the	1
margin	1
by	1
a	1
park-keeper.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
identified	1
as	1
her	1
clothes,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
clothes	1
were	1
there	1
the	1
body	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
far	1
off."	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
same	1
brilliant	1
reasoning,	1
every	1
man's	1
body	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
his	1
wardrobe.	1
And	1
pray	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
hope	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
through	1
this?"	1
	1
"At	1
some	1
evidence	1
implicating	1
Flora	1
Millar	1
in	1
the	1
disappearance."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
difficult."	1
	1
"Are	1
you,	1
indeed,	1
now?"	1
cried	1
Lestrade	1
with	1
some	1
bitterness.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
practical	1
with	1
your	1
deductions	1
and	1
your	1
inferences.	1
You	1
have	1
made	1
two	1
blunders	1
in	1
as	1
many	1
minutes.	1
This	1
dress	1
does	1
implicate	1
Miss	1
Flora	1
Millar."	1
	1
"And	1
how?"	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
dress	1
is	1
a	1
pocket.	1
In	1
the	1
pocket	1
is	1
a	1
card-case.	1
In	1
the	1
card-case	1
is	1
a	1
note.	1
And	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
note."	1
He	1
slapped	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
"Listen	1
to	1
this:	1
'You	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
when	1
all	1
is	1
ready.	1
Come	1
at	1
once.	1
F.H.M.'	1
Now	1
my	1
theory	1
all	1
along	1
has	1
been	1
that	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
was	1
decoyed	1
away	1
by	1
Flora	1
Millar,	1
and	1
that	1
she,	1
with	1
confederates,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
responsible	1
for	1
her	1
disappearance.	1
Here,	1
signed	1
with	1
her	1
initials,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
note	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
quietly	1
slipped	1
into	1
her	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
which	1
lured	1
her	1
within	1
their	1
reach."	1
	1
"Very	1
good,	1
Lestrade,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
laughing.	1
"You	1
really	1
are	1
very	1
fine	1
indeed.	1
Let	1
me	1
see	1
it."	1
He	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
a	1
listless	1
way,	1
but	1
his	1
attention	1
instantly	1
became	1
riveted,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
little	1
cry	1
of	1
satisfaction.	1
"This	1
is	1
indeed	1
important,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Ha!	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
so?"	1
	1
"Extremely	1
so.	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
warmly."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
triumph	1
and	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
look.	1
"Why,"	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
"you're	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
side!"	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
right	1
side."	1
	1
"The	1
right	1
side?	1
You're	1
mad!	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
note	1
written	1
in	1
pencil	1
over	1
here."	1
	1
"And	1
over	1
here	1
is	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
fragment	1
of	1
a	1
hotel	1
bill,	1
which	1
interests	1
me	1
deeply."	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
in	1
it.	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
before,"	1
said	1
Lestrade.	1
"'Oct.	1
4th,	1
rooms	1
8s.,	1
breakfast	1
2s.	1
6d.,	1
cocktail	1
1s.,	1
lunch	1
2s.	1
6d.,	1
glass	1
sherry,	1
8d.'	1
I	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
that."	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
not.	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
important,	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
note,	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
also,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
initials	1
are,	1
so	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you	1
again."	1
	1
"I've	1
wasted	1
time	1
enough,"	1
said	1
Lestrade,	1
rising.	1
"I	1
believe	1
in	1
hard	1
work	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
spinning	1
fine	1
theories.	1
Good-day,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
which	1
gets	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
first."	1
He	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
garments,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Just	1
one	1
hint	1
to	1
you,	1
Lestrade,"	1
drawled	1
Holmes	1
before	1
his	1
rival	1
vanished;	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
Lady	1
St.	1
Simon	1
is	1
a	1
myth.	1
There	1
is	1
not,	1
and	1
there	1
never	1
has	1
been,	1
any	1
such	1
person."	1
	1
Lestrade	1
looked	1
sadly	1
at	1
my	1
companion.	1
Then	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
me,	1
tapped	1
his	1
forehead	1
three	1
times,	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
solemnly,	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him	1
when	1
Holmes	1
rose	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
overcoat.	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
fellow	1
says	1
about	1
outdoor	1
work,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
"so	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
papers	1
for	1
a	1
little."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
after	1
five	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
left	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
lonely,	1
for	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
there	1
arrived	1
a	1
confectioner's	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
flat	1
box.	1
This	1
he	1
unpacked	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
a	1
youth	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
presently,	1
to	1
my	1
very	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
a	1
quite	1
epicurean	1
little	1
cold	1
supper	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
out	1
upon	1
our	1
humble	1
lodging-house	1
mahogany.	1
There	1
were	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
brace	1
of	1
cold	1
woodcock,	1
a	1
pheasant,	1
a	1
pâté	1
de	1
foie	1
gras	1
pie	1
with	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
ancient	1
and	1
cobwebby	1
bottles.	1
Having	1
laid	1
out	1
all	1
these	1
luxuries,	1
my	1
two	1
visitors	1
vanished	1
away,	1
like	1
the	1
genii	1
of	1
the	1
Arabian	1
Nights,	1
with	1
no	1
explanation	1
save	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
for	1
and	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
this	1
address.	1
	1
Just	1
before	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
stepped	1
briskly	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
His	1
features	1
were	1
gravely	1
set,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
light	1
in	1
his	1
eye	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disappointed	1
in	1
his	1
conclusions.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
supper,	1
then,"	1
he	1
said,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
expect	1
company.	1
They	1
have	1
laid	1
for	1
five."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
fancy	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
company	1
dropping	1
in,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
am	1
surprised	1
that	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
has	1
not	1
already	1
arrived.	1
Ha!	1
I	1
fancy	1
that	1
I	1
hear	1
his	1
step	1
now	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
indeed	1
our	1
visitor	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon	1
who	1
came	1
bustling	1
in,	1
dangling	1
his	1
glasses	1
more	1
vigorously	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
perturbed	1
expression	1
upon	1
his	1
aristocratic	1
features.	1
	1
"My	1
messenger	1
reached	1
you,	1
then?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
contents	1
startled	1
me	1
beyond	1
measure.	1
Have	1
you	1
good	1
authority	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
say?"	1
	1
"The	1
best	1
possible."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
sank	1
into	1
a	1
chair	1
and	1
passed	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"What	1
will	1
the	1
Duke	1
say,"	1
he	1
murmured,	1
"when	1
he	1
hears	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
has	1
been	1
subjected	1
to	1
such	1
humiliation?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
purest	1
accident.	1
I	1
cannot	1
allow	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
humiliation."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
look	1
on	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
another	1
standpoint."	1
	1
"I	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
anyone	1
is	1
to	1
blame.	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
lady	1
could	1
have	1
acted	1
otherwise,	1
though	1
her	1
abrupt	1
method	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
to	1
be	1
regretted.	1
Having	1
no	1
mother,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
advise	1
her	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
crisis."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
slight,	1
sir,	1
a	1
public	1
slight,"	1
said	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
tapping	1
his	1
fingers	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
make	1
allowance	1
for	1
this	1
poor	1
girl,	1
placed	1
in	1
so	1
unprecedented	1
a	1
position."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
allowance.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
angry	1
indeed,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
shamefully	1
used."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
ring,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
steps	1
on	1
the	1
landing.	1
If	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
lenient	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
an	1
advocate	1
here	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
successful."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
ushered	1
in	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
gentleman.	1
"Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,"	1
said	1
he	1
"allow	1
me	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Francis	1
Hay	1
Moulton.	1
The	1
lady,	1
I	1
think,	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
met."	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
these	1
newcomers	1
our	1
client	1
had	1
sprung	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
stood	1
very	1
erect,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
cast	1
down	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
thrust	1
into	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
his	1
frock-coat,	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
offended	1
dignity.	1
The	1
lady	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
quick	1
step	1
forward	1
and	1
had	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
still	1
refused	1
to	1
raise	1
his	1
eyes.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
his	1
resolution,	1
perhaps,	1
for	1
her	1
pleading	1
face	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
resist.	1
	1
"You're	1
angry,	1
Robert,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Well,	1
I	1
guess	1
you	1
have	1
every	1
cause	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
"Pray	1
make	1
no	1
apology	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
bitterly.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
treated	1
you	1
real	1
bad	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
went;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
rattled,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
Frank	1
here	1
again	1
I	1
just	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
or	1
saying.	1
I	1
only	1
wonder	1
I	1
didn't	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
do	1
a	1
faint	1
right	1
there	1
before	1
the	1
altar."	1
	1
"Perhaps,	1
Mrs.	1
Moulton,	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room	1
while	1
you	1
explain	1
this	1
matter?"	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
opinion,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
strange	1
gentleman,	1
"we've	1
had	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
secrecy	1
over	1
this	1
business	1
already.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
all	1
Europe	1
and	1
America	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
it."	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
wiry,	1
sunburnt	1
man,	1
clean-shaven,	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
face	1
and	1
alert	1
manner.	1
	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
tell	1
our	1
story	1
right	1
away,"	1
said	1
the	1
lady.	1
"Frank	1
here	1
and	1
I	1
met	1
in	1
'84,	1
in	1
McQuire's	1
camp,	1
near	1
the	1
Rockies,	1
where	1
pa	1
was	1
working	1
a	1
claim.	1
We	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
Frank	1
and	1
I;	1
but	1
then	1
one	1
day	1
father	1
struck	1
a	1
rich	1
pocket	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
pile,	1
while	1
poor	1
Frank	1
here	1
had	1
a	1
claim	1
that	1
petered	1
out	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
nothing.	1
The	1
richer	1
pa	1
grew	1
the	1
poorer	1
was	1
Frank;	1
so	1
at	1
last	1
pa	1
wouldn't	1
hear	1
of	1
our	1
engagement	1
lasting	1
any	1
longer,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
me	1
away	1
to	1
'Frisco.	1
Frank	1
wouldn't	1
throw	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
though;	1
so	1
he	1
followed	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
without	1
pa	1
knowing	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
mad	1
to	1
know,	1
so	1
we	1
just	1
fixed	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
for	1
ourselves.	1
Frank	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
pile,	1
too,	1
and	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
claim	1
me	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
pa.	1
So	1
then	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
pledged	1
myself	1
not	1
to	1
marry	1
anyone	1
else	1
while	1
he	1
lived.	1
'Why	1
shouldn't	1
we	1
be	1
married	1
right	1
away,	1
then,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
feel	1
sure	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
claim	1
to	1
be	1
your	1
husband	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
back?'	1
Well,	1
we	1
talked	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
so	1
nicely,	1
with	1
a	1
clergyman	1
all	1
ready	1
in	1
waiting,	1
that	1
we	1
just	1
did	1
it	1
right	1
there;	1
and	1
then	1
Frank	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
fortune,	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
pa.	1
	1
"The	1
next	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
Frank	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Montana,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
prospecting	1
in	1
Arizona,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
New	1
Mexico.	1
After	1
that	1
came	1
a	1
long	1
newspaper	1
story	1
about	1
how	1
a	1
miners'	1
camp	1
had	1
been	1
attacked	1
by	1
Apache	1
Indians,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
my	1
Frank's	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
killed.	1
I	1
fainted	1
dead	1
away,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
sick	1
for	1
months	1
after.	1
Pa	1
thought	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
decline	1
and	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
half	1
the	1
doctors	1
in	1
'Frisco.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
news	1
came	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
more,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
doubted	1
that	1
Frank	1
was	1
really	1
dead.	1
Then	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
came	1
to	1
'Frisco,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
London,	1
and	1
a	1
marriage	1
was	1
arranged,	1
and	1
pa	1
was	1
very	1
pleased,	1
but	1
I	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
on	1
this	1
earth	1
would	1
ever	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
Frank.	1
	1
"Still,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
married	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
of	1
course	1
I'd	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
duty	1
by	1
him.	1
We	1
can't	1
command	1
our	1
love,	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
our	1
actions.	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
wife	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
be.	1
But	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
when,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
rails,	1
I	1
glanced	1
back	1
and	1
saw	1
Frank	1
standing	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
pew.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
ghost	1
at	1
first;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
again	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
still,	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
question	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
were	1
glad	1
or	1
sorry	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
I	1
wonder	1
I	1
didn't	1
drop.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
turning	1
round,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
clergyman	1
were	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
buzz	1
of	1
a	1
bee	1
in	1
my	1
ear.	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
Should	1
I	1
stop	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
in	1
the	1
church?	1
I	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
thinking,	1
for	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
finger	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
still.	1
Then	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
scribble	1
on	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
writing	1
me	1
a	1
note.	1
As	1
I	1
passed	1
his	1
pew	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
I	1
dropped	1
my	1
bouquet	1
over	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
slipped	1
the	1
note	1
into	1
my	1
hand	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
me	1
the	1
flowers.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
line	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
never	1
doubted	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
my	1
first	1
duty	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
do	1
just	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
direct.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
maid,	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
in	1
California,	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
his	1
friend.	1
I	1
ordered	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
nothing,	1
but	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
few	1
things	1
packed	1
and	1
my	1
ulster	1
ready.	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
dreadful	1
hard	1
before	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
great	1
people.	1
I	1
just	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
explain	1
afterwards.	1
I	1
hadn't	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
ten	1
minutes	1
before	1
I	1
saw	1
Frank	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
He	1
beckoned	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
then	1
began	1
walking	1
into	1
the	1
Park.	1
I	1
slipped	1
out,	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
things,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
Some	1
woman	1
came	1
talking	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
to	1
me--seemed	1
to	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
I	1
heard	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
before	1
marriage	1
also--but	1
I	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
and	1
soon	1
overtook	1
Frank.	1
We	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
cab	1
together,	1
and	1
away	1
we	1
drove	1
to	1
some	1
lodgings	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
in	1
Gordon	1
Square,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
true	1
wedding	1
after	1
all	1
those	1
years	1
of	1
waiting.	1
Frank	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
among	1
the	1
Apaches,	1
had	1
escaped,	1
came	1
on	1
to	1
'Frisco,	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
dead	1
and	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
England,	1
followed	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
wedding."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
paper,"	1
explained	1
the	1
American.	1
"It	1
gave	1
the	1
name	1
and	1
the	1
church	1
but	1
not	1
where	1
the	1
lady	1
lived."	1
	1
"Then	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
talk	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
do,	1
and	1
Frank	1
was	1
all	1
for	1
openness,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
vanish	1
away	1
and	1
never	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
again--just	1
sending	1
a	1
line	1
to	1
pa,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
alive.	1
It	1
was	1
awful	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
lords	1
and	1
ladies	1
sitting	1
round	1
that	1
breakfast-table	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
back.	1
So	1
Frank	1
took	1
my	1
wedding-clothes	1
and	1
things	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
traced,	1
and	1
dropped	1
them	1
away	1
somewhere	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
find	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
likely	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
to	1
Paris	1
to-morrow,	1
only	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
gentleman,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
us	1
this	1
evening,	1
though	1
how	1
he	1
found	1
us	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
think,	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
us	1
very	1
clearly	1
and	1
kindly	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
Frank	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
putting	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
secret.	1
Then	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
alone,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
came	1
right	1
away	1
round	1
to	1
his	1
rooms	1
at	1
once.	1
Now,	1
Robert,	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
pain,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
very	1
meanly	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
had	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
relaxed	1
his	1
rigid	1
attitude,	1
but	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
brow	1
and	1
a	1
compressed	1
lip	1
to	1
this	1
long	1
narrative.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
custom	1
to	1
discuss	1
my	1
most	1
intimate	1
personal	1
affairs	1
in	1
this	1
public	1
manner."	1
	1
"Then	1
you	1
won't	1
forgive	1
me?	1
You	1
won't	1
shake	1
hands	1
before	1
I	1
go?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
certainly,	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
you	1
any	1
pleasure."	1
He	1
put	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
coldly	1
grasped	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
extended	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
hoped,"	1
suggested	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
joined	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
supper."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
there	1
you	1
ask	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much,"	1
responded	1
his	1
Lordship.	1
"I	1
may	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
these	1
recent	1
developments,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
over	1
them.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
with	1
your	1
permission	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
wish	1
you	1
all	1
a	1
very	1
good-night."	1
He	1
included	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
sweeping	1
bow	1
and	1
stalked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
you	1
at	1
least	1
will	1
honour	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
company,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes.	1
"It	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
joy	1
to	1
meet	1
an	1
American,	1
Mr.	1
Moulton,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
a	1
monarch	1
and	1
the	1
blundering	1
of	1
a	1
minister	1
in	1
far-gone	1
years	1
will	1
not	1
prevent	1
our	1
children	1
from	1
being	1
some	1
day	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
world-wide	1
country	1
under	1
a	1
flag	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
quartering	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
Jack	1
with	1
the	1
Stars	1
and	1
Stripes."	1
	1
"The	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
interesting	1
one,"	1
remarked	1
Holmes	1
when	1
our	1
visitors	1
had	1
left	1
us,	1
"because	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
show	1
very	1
clearly	1
how	1
simple	1
the	1
explanation	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
affair	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
inexplicable.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
events	1
as	1
narrated	1
by	1
this	1
lady,	1
and	1
nothing	1
stranger	1
than	1
the	1
result	1
when	1
viewed,	1
for	1
instance,	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Lestrade	1
of	1
Scotland	1
Yard."	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
not	1
yourself	1
at	1
fault	1
at	1
all,	1
then?"	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
first,	1
two	1
facts	1
were	1
very	1
obvious	1
to	1
me,	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
willing	1
to	1
undergo	1
the	1
wedding	1
ceremony,	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
repented	1
of	1
it	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
of	1
returning	1
home.	1
Obviously	1
something	1
had	1
occurred	1
during	1
the	1
morning,	1
then,	1
to	1
cause	1
her	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
mind.	1
What	1
could	1
that	1
something	1
be?	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
spoken	1
to	1
anyone	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
out,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
Had	1
she	1
seen	1
someone,	1
then?	1
If	1
she	1
had,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
someone	1
from	1
America	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
allowed	1
anyone	1
to	1
acquire	1
so	1
deep	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
mere	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
induce	1
her	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
plans	1
so	1
completely.	1
You	1
see	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
arrived,	1
by	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
exclusion,	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
American.	1
Then	1
who	1
could	1
this	1
American	1
be,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
possess	1
so	1
much	1
influence	1
over	1
her?	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
lover;	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
husband.	1
Her	1
young	1
womanhood	1
had,	1
I	1
knew,	1
been	1
spent	1
in	1
rough	1
scenes	1
and	1
under	1
strange	1
conditions.	1
So	1
far	1
I	1
had	1
got	1
before	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon's	1
narrative.	1
When	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
pew,	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
bride's	1
manner,	1
of	1
so	1
transparent	1
a	1
device	1
for	1
obtaining	1
a	1
note	1
as	1
the	1
dropping	1
of	1
a	1
bouquet,	1
of	1
her	1
resort	1
to	1
her	1
confidential	1
maid,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
very	1
significant	1
allusion	1
to	1
claim-jumping--which	1
in	1
miners'	1
parlance	1
means	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
another	1
person	1
has	1
a	1
prior	1
claim	1
to--the	1
whole	1
situation	1
became	1
absolutely	1
clear.	1
She	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
either	1
a	1
lover	1
or	1
was	1
a	1
previous	1
husband--the	1
chances	1
being	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
latter."	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
them?"	1
	1
"It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
difficult,	1
but	1
friend	1
Lestrade	1
held	1
information	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know.	1
The	1
initials	1
were,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
importance,	1
but	1
more	1
valuable	1
still	1
was	1
it	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
within	1
a	1
week	1
he	1
had	1
settled	1
his	1
bill	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
select	1
London	1
hotels."	1
	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
deduce	1
the	1
select?"	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
select	1
prices.	1
Eight	1
shillings	1
for	1
a	1
bed	1
and	1
eightpence	1
for	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
sherry	1
pointed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
expensive	1
hotels.	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
London	1
which	1
charge	1
at	1
that	1
rate.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
one	1
which	1
I	1
visited	1
in	1
Northumberland	1
Avenue,	1
I	1
learned	1
by	1
an	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
that	1
Francis	1
H.	1
Moulton,	1
an	1
American	1
gentleman,	1
had	1
left	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
and	1
on	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
entries	1
against	1
him,	1
I	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
very	1
items	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
duplicate	1
bill.	1
His	1
letters	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
forwarded	1
to	1
226	1
Gordon	1
Square;	1
so	1
thither	1
I	1
travelled,	1
and	1
being	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
loving	1
couple	1
at	1
home,	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
some	1
paternal	1
advice	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
their	1
position	1
a	1
little	1
clearer	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
and	1
to	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
in	1
particular.	1
I	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
here,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
see,	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
keep	1
the	1
appointment."	1
	1
"But	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
good	1
result,"	1
I	1
remarked.	1
"His	1
conduct	1
was	1
certainly	1
not	1
very	1
gracious."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling,	1
"perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
gracious	1
either,	1
if,	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
wooing	1
and	1
wedding,	1
you	1
found	1
yourself	1
deprived	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
of	1
fortune.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
judge	1
Lord	1
St.	1
Simon	1
very	1
mercifully	1
and	1
thank	1
our	1
stars	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
never	1
likely	1
to	1
find	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position.	1
Draw	1
your	1
chair	1
up	1
and	1
hand	1
me	1
my	1
violin,	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
problem	1
we	1
have	1
still	1
to	1
solve	1
is	1
how	1
to	1
while	1
away	1
these	1
bleak	1
autumnal	1
evenings."	1
	1
	1
	1
XI.	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
BERYL	1
CORONET	1
	1
"Holmes,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
I	1
stood	1
one	1
morning	1
in	1
our	1
bow-window	1
looking	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
"here	1
is	1
a	1
madman	1
coming	1
along.	1
It	1
seems	1
rather	1
sad	1
that	1
his	1
relatives	1
should	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
alone."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
rose	1
lazily	1
from	1
his	1
armchair	1
and	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
pockets	1
of	1
his	1
dressing-gown,	1
looking	1
over	1
my	1
shoulder.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bright,	1
crisp	1
February	1
morning,	1
and	1
the	1
snow	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
still	1
lay	1
deep	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
shimmering	1
brightly	1
in	1
the	1
wintry	1
sun.	1
Down	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
ploughed	1
into	1
a	1
brown	1
crumbly	1
band	1
by	1
the	1
traffic,	1
but	1
at	1
either	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
heaped-up	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
foot-paths	1
it	1
still	1
lay	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
when	1
it	1
fell.	1
The	1
grey	1
pavement	1
had	1
been	1
cleaned	1
and	1
scraped,	1
but	1
was	1
still	1
dangerously	1
slippery,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
fewer	1
passengers	1
than	1
usual.	1
Indeed,	1
from	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Metropolitan	1
Station	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
coming	1
save	1
the	1
single	1
gentleman	1
whose	1
eccentric	1
conduct	1
had	1
drawn	1
my	1
attention.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
fifty,	1
tall,	1
portly,	1
and	1
imposing,	1
with	1
a	1
massive,	1
strongly	1
marked	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
commanding	1
figure.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
sombre	1
yet	1
rich	1
style,	1
in	1
black	1
frock-coat,	1
shining	1
hat,	1
neat	1
brown	1
gaiters,	1
and	1
well-cut	1
pearl-grey	1
trousers.	1
Yet	1
his	1
actions	1
were	1
in	1
absurd	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
his	1
dress	1
and	1
features,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
running	1
hard,	1
with	1
occasional	1
little	1
springs,	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
weary	1
man	1
gives	1
who	1
is	1
little	1
accustomed	1
to	1
set	1
any	1
tax	1
upon	1
his	1
legs.	1
As	1
he	1
ran	1
he	1
jerked	1
his	1
hands	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
waggled	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
writhed	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
contortions.	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
"He	1
is	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
houses."	1
	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
here,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
"Here?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
I	1
rather	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
consult	1
me	1
professionally.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
recognise	1
the	1
symptoms.	1
Ha!	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you?"	1
As	1
he	1
spoke,	1
the	1
man,	1
puffing	1
and	1
blowing,	1
rushed	1
at	1
our	1
door	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
our	1
bell	1
until	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
resounded	1
with	1
the	1
clanging.	1
	1
A	1
few	1
moments	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
our	1
room,	1
still	1
puffing,	1
still	1
gesticulating,	1
but	1
with	1
so	1
fixed	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
despair	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
our	1
smiles	1
were	1
turned	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
horror	1
and	1
pity.	1
For	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
his	1
words	1
out,	1
but	1
swayed	1
his	1
body	1
and	1
plucked	1
at	1
his	1
hair	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
driven	1
to	1
the	1
extreme	1
limits	1
of	1
his	1
reason.	1
Then,	1
suddenly	1
springing	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
he	1
beat	1
his	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
we	1
both	1
rushed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
tore	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
pushed	1
him	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
easy-chair	1
and,	1
sitting	1
beside	1
him,	1
patted	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
chatted	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
easy,	1
soothing	1
tones	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
employ.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
story,	1
have	1
you	1
not?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
are	1
fatigued	1
with	1
your	1
haste.	1
Pray	1
wait	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
recovered	1
yourself,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
happy	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
any	1
little	1
problem	1
which	1
you	1
may	1
submit	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
man	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
more	1
with	1
a	1
heaving	1
chest,	1
fighting	1
against	1
his	1
emotion.	1
Then	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
over	1
his	1
brow,	1
set	1
his	1
lips	1
tight,	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
face	1
towards	1
us.	1
	1
"No	1
doubt	1
you	1
think	1
me	1
mad?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"I	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
great	1
trouble,"	1
responded	1
Holmes.	1
	1
"God	1
knows	1
I	1
have!--a	1
trouble	1
which	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
unseat	1
my	1
reason,	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
so	1
terrible	1
is	1
it.	1
Public	1
disgrace	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
faced,	1
although	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
character	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
borne	1
a	1
stain.	1
Private	1
affliction	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
every	1
man;	1
but	1
the	1
two	1
coming	1
together,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
frightful	1
a	1
form,	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
shake	1
my	1
very	1
soul.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
I	1
alone.	1
The	1
very	1
noblest	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
may	1
suffer	1
unless	1
some	1
way	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
horrible	1
affair."	1
	1
"Pray	1
compose	1
yourself,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"and	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
clear	1
account	1
of	1
who	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
has	1
befallen	1
you."	1
	1
"My	1
name,"	1
answered	1
our	1
visitor,	1
"is	1
probably	1
familiar	1
to	1
your	1
ears.	1
I	1
am	1
Alexander	1
Holder,	1
of	1
the	1
banking	1
firm	1
of	1
Holder	1
&	1
Stevenson,	1
of	1
Threadneedle	1
Street."	1
	1
The	1
name	1
was	1
indeed	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
senior	1
partner	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
largest	1
private	1
banking	1
concern	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
of	1
London.	1
What	1
could	1
have	1
happened,	1
then,	1
to	1
bring	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
citizens	1
of	1
London	1
to	1
this	1
most	1
pitiable	1
pass?	1
We	1
waited,	1
all	1
curiosity,	1
until	1
with	1
another	1
effort	1
he	1
braced	1
himself	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"I	1
feel	1
that	1
time	1
is	1
of	1
value,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
hastened	1
here	1
when	1
the	1
police	1
inspector	1
suggested	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
secure	1
your	1
co-operation.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Baker	1
Street	1
by	1
the	1
Underground	1
and	1
hurried	1
from	1
there	1
on	1
foot,	1
for	1
the	1
cabs	1
go	1
slowly	1
through	1
this	1
snow.	1
That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
breath,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
takes	1
very	1
little	1
exercise.	1
I	1
feel	1
better	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
the	1
facts	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
shortly	1
and	1
yet	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
	1
"It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
successful	1
banking	1
business	1
as	1
much	1
depends	1
upon	1
our	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
remunerative	1
investments	1
for	1
our	1
funds	1
as	1
upon	1
our	1
increasing	1
our	1
connection	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
our	1
depositors.	1
One	1
of	1
our	1
most	1
lucrative	1
means	1
of	1
laying	1
out	1
money	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
loans,	1
where	1
the	1
security	1
is	1
unimpeachable.	1
We	1
have	1
done	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
noble	1
families	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
advanced	1
large	1
sums	1
upon	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
their	1
pictures,	1
libraries,	1
or	1
plate.	1
	1
"Yesterday	1
morning	1
I	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
my	1
office	1
at	1
the	1
bank	1
when	1
a	1
card	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
clerks.	1
I	1
started	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
name,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
none	1
other	1
than--well,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
to	1
you	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
household	1
word	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
earth--one	1
of	1
the	1
highest,	1
noblest,	1
most	1
exalted	1
names	1
in	1
England.	1
I	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
attempted,	1
when	1
he	1
entered,	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
but	1
he	1
plunged	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
business	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
hurry	1
quickly	1
through	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
task.	1
	1
"'Mr.	1
Holder,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
have	1
been	1
informed	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
advancing	1
money.'	1
	1
"'The	1
firm	1
does	1
so	1
when	1
the	1
security	1
is	1
good.'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
to	1
me,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
50,000	1
pounds	1
at	1
once.	1
I	1
could,	1
of	1
course,	1
borrow	1
so	1
trifling	1
a	1
sum	1
ten	1
times	1
over	1
from	1
my	1
friends,	1
but	1
I	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
business	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
that	1
business	1
myself.	1
In	1
my	1
position	1
you	1
can	1
readily	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
unwise	1
to	1
place	1
one's	1
self	1
under	1
obligations.'	1
	1
"'For	1
how	1
long,	1
may	1
I	1
ask,	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
this	1
sum?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Next	1
Monday	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
due	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
then	1
most	1
certainly	1
repay	1
what	1
you	1
advance,	1
with	1
whatever	1
interest	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
charge.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
essential	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
should	1
be	1
paid	1
at	1
once.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
advance	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
parley	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
private	1
purse,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
strain	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
could	1
bear.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
firm,	1
then	1
in	1
justice	1
to	1
my	1
partner	1
I	1
must	1
insist	1
that,	1
even	1
in	1
your	1
case,	1
every	1
businesslike	1
precaution	1
should	1
be	1
taken.'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
much	1
prefer	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so,'	1
said	1
he,	1
raising	1
up	1
a	1
square,	1
black	1
morocco	1
case	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
beside	1
his	1
chair.	1
'You	1
have	1
doubtless	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
Beryl	1
Coronet?'	1
	1
"'One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
public	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
empire,'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Precisely.'	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
there,	1
imbedded	1
in	1
soft,	1
flesh-coloured	1
velvet,	1
lay	1
the	1
magnificent	1
piece	1
of	1
jewellery	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
named.	1
'There	1
are	1
thirty-nine	1
enormous	1
beryls,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
chasing	1
is	1
incalculable.	1
The	1
lowest	1
estimate	1
would	1
put	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
at	1
double	1
the	1
sum	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
asked.	1
I	1
am	1
prepared	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
security.'	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
the	1
precious	1
case	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
some	1
perplexity	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
illustrious	1
client.	1
	1
"'You	1
doubt	1
its	1
value?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Not	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
only	1
doubt--'	1
	1
"'The	1
propriety	1
of	1
my	1
leaving	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
set	1
your	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
about	1
that.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
in	1
four	1
days	1
to	1
reclaim	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pure	1
matter	1
of	1
form.	1
Is	1
the	1
security	1
sufficient?'	1
	1
"'Ample.'	1
	1
"'You	1
understand,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you	1
a	1
strong	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
you,	1
founded	1
upon	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
you.	1
I	1
rely	1
upon	1
you	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
discreet	1
and	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
all	1
gossip	1
upon	1
the	1
matter	1
but,	1
above	1
all,	1
to	1
preserve	1
this	1
coronet	1
with	1
every	1
possible	1
precaution	1
because	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
public	1
scandal	1
would	1
be	1
caused	1
if	1
any	1
harm	1
were	1
to	1
befall	1
it.	1
Any	1
injury	1
to	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
as	1
serious	1
as	1
its	1
complete	1
loss,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
beryls	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
match	1
these,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
replace	1
them.	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
with	1
you,	1
however,	1
with	1
every	1
confidence,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
person	1
on	1
Monday	1
morning.'	1
	1
"Seeing	1
that	1
my	1
client	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
leave,	1
I	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
but,	1
calling	1
for	1
my	1
cashier,	1
I	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
over	1
fifty	1
1000	1
pound	1
notes.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
alone	1
once	1
more,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
case	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
think	1
with	1
some	1
misgivings	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
responsibility	1
which	1
it	1
entailed	1
upon	1
me.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
national	1
possession,	1
a	1
horrible	1
scandal	1
would	1
ensue	1
if	1
any	1
misfortune	1
should	1
occur	1
to	1
it.	1
I	1
already	1
regretted	1
having	1
ever	1
consented	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
it.	1
However,	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
alter	1
the	1
matter	1
now,	1
so	1
I	1
locked	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
private	1
safe	1
and	1
turned	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
work.	1
	1
"When	1
evening	1
came	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
imprudence	1
to	1
leave	1
so	1
precious	1
a	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
behind	1
me.	1
Bankers'	1
safes	1
had	1
been	1
forced	1
before	1
now,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
not	1
mine	1
be?	1
If	1
so,	1
how	1
terrible	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
myself!	1
I	1
determined,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
few	1
days	1
I	1
would	1
always	1
carry	1
the	1
case	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
with	1
me,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
never	1
be	1
really	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
reach.	1
With	1
this	1
intention,	1
I	1
called	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
house	1
at	1
Streatham,	1
carrying	1
the	1
jewel	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
breathe	1
freely	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
upstairs	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
bureau	1
of	1
my	1
dressing-room.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
a	1
word	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
household,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
for	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
thoroughly	1
understand	1
the	1
situation.	1
My	1
groom	1
and	1
my	1
page	1
sleep	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
set	1
aside	1
altogether.	1
I	1
have	1
three	1
maid-servants	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
years	1
and	1
whose	1
absolute	1
reliability	1
is	1
quite	1
above	1
suspicion.	1
Another,	1
Lucy	1
Parr,	1
the	1
second	1
waiting-maid,	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
service	1
a	1
few	1
months.	1
She	1
came	1
with	1
an	1
excellent	1
character,	1
however,	1
and	1
has	1
always	1
given	1
me	1
satisfaction.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
girl	1
and	1
has	1
attracted	1
admirers	1
who	1
have	1
occasionally	1
hung	1
about	1
the	1
place.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
drawback	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
we	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
good	1
girl	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
servants.	1
My	1
family	1
itself	1
is	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
long	1
to	1
describe	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
widower	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
Arthur.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
disappointment	1
to	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes--a	1
grievous	1
disappointment.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
to	1
blame.	1
People	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoiled	1
him.	1
Very	1
likely	1
I	1
have.	1
When	1
my	1
dear	1
wife	1
died	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
love.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
smile	1
fade	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
denied	1
him	1
a	1
wish.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
sterner,	1
but	1
I	1
meant	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
naturally	1
my	1
intention	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
succeed	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
business,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
business	1
turn.	1
He	1
was	1
wild,	1
wayward,	1
and,	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
trust	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
handling	1
of	1
large	1
sums	1
of	1
money.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
young	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
an	1
aristocratic	1
club,	1
and	1
there,	1
having	1
charming	1
manners,	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
the	1
intimate	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
with	1
long	1
purses	1
and	1
expensive	1
habits.	1
He	1
learned	1
to	1
play	1
heavily	1
at	1
cards	1
and	1
to	1
squander	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
turf,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
implore	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
advance	1
upon	1
his	1
allowance,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
settle	1
his	1
debts	1
of	1
honour.	1
He	1
tried	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
to	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
dangerous	1
company	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
keeping,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
draw	1
him	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
"And,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wonder	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
should	1
gain	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
frequently	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
resist	1
the	1
fascination	1
of	1
his	1
manner.	1
He	1
is	1
older	1
than	1
Arthur,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
his	1
finger-tips,	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
everywhere,	1
seen	1
everything,	1
a	1
brilliant	1
talker,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
personal	1
beauty.	1
Yet	1
when	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
cold	1
blood,	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
his	1
presence,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
from	1
his	1
cynical	1
speech	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
deeply	1
distrusted.	1
So	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
so,	1
too,	1
thinks	1
my	1
little	1
Mary,	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
woman's	1
quick	1
insight	1
into	1
character.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
she	1
to	1
be	1
described.	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
niece;	1
but	1
when	1
my	1
brother	1
died	1
five	1
years	1
ago	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
adopted	1
her,	1
and	1
have	1
looked	1
upon	1
her	1
ever	1
since	1
as	1
my	1
daughter.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
sunbeam	1
in	1
my	1
house--sweet,	1
loving,	1
beautiful,	1
a	1
wonderful	1
manager	1
and	1
housekeeper,	1
yet	1
as	1
tender	1
and	1
quiet	1
and	1
gentle	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
could	1
be.	1
She	1
is	1
my	1
right	1
hand.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
without	1
her.	1
In	1
only	1
one	1
matter	1
has	1
she	1
ever	1
gone	1
against	1
my	1
wishes.	1
Twice	1
my	1
boy	1
has	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
loves	1
her	1
devotedly,	1
but	1
each	1
time	1
she	1
has	1
refused	1
him.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
drawn	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
right	1
path	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
she,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
marriage	1
might	1
have	1
changed	1
his	1
whole	1
life;	1
but	1
now,	1
alas!	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late--forever	1
too	1
late!	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
live	1
under	1
my	1
roof,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
continue	1
with	1
my	1
miserable	1
story.	1
	1
"When	1
we	1
were	1
taking	1
coffee	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
that	1
night	1
after	1
dinner,	1
I	1
told	1
Arthur	1
and	1
Mary	1
my	1
experience,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
treasure	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
under	1
our	1
roof,	1
suppressing	1
only	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
client.	1
Lucy	1
Parr,	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
coffee,	1
had,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
left	1
the	1
room;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
swear	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed.	1
Mary	1
and	1
Arthur	1
were	1
much	1
interested	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
famous	1
coronet,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
it.	1
	1
"'Where	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
it?'	1
asked	1
Arthur.	1
	1
"'In	1
my	1
own	1
bureau.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
goodness	1
the	1
house	1
won't	1
be	1
burgled	1
during	1
the	1
night.'	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
locked	1
up,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
any	1
old	1
key	1
will	1
fit	1
that	1
bureau.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
youngster	1
I	1
have	1
opened	1
it	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
the	1
box-room	1
cupboard.'	1
	1
"He	1
often	1
had	1
a	1
wild	1
way	1
of	1
talking,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
thought	1
little	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
He	1
followed	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
room,	1
however,	1
that	1
night	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
grave	1
face.	1
	1
"'Look	1
here,	1
dad,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
cast	1
down,	1
'can	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
200	1
pounds?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
cannot!'	1
I	1
answered	1
sharply.	1
'I	1
have	1
been	1
far	1
too	1
generous	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
money	1
matters.'	1
	1
"'You	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
kind,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'but	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
this	1
money,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
show	1
my	1
face	1
inside	1
the	1
club	1
again.'	1
	1
"'And	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
too!'	1
I	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
leave	1
it	1
a	1
dishonoured	1
man,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
disgrace.	1
I	1
must	1
raise	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it,	1
then	1
I	1
must	1
try	1
other	1
means.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
angry,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
demand	1
during	1
the	1
month.	1
'You	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
farthing	1
from	1
me,'	1
I	1
cried,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
another	1
word.	1
	1
"When	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
I	1
unlocked	1
my	1
bureau,	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
my	1
treasure	1
was	1
safe,	1
and	1
locked	1
it	1
again.	1
Then	1
I	1
started	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
secure--a	1
duty	1
which	1
I	1
usually	1
leave	1
to	1
Mary	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
perform	1
myself	1
that	1
night.	1
As	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
I	1
saw	1
Mary	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
which	1
she	1
closed	1
and	1
fastened	1
as	1
I	1
approached.	1
	1
"'Tell	1
me,	1
dad,'	1
said	1
she,	1
looking,	1
I	1
thought,	1
a	1
little	1
disturbed,	1
'did	1
you	1
give	1
Lucy,	1
the	1
maid,	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to-night?'	1
	1
"'Certainly	1
not.'	1
	1
"'She	1
came	1
in	1
just	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
gate	1
to	1
see	1
someone,	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
hardly	1
safe	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
stopped.'	1
	1
"'You	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
sure	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
fastened?'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
sure,	1
dad.'	1
	1
"'Then,	1
good-night.'	1
I	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
bedroom	1
again,	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
soon	1
asleep.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
everything,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
any	1
bearing	1
upon	1
the	1
case,	1
but	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
question	1
me	1
upon	1
any	1
point	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
clear."	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
statement	1
is	1
singularly	1
lucid."	1
	1
"I	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
now	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
so.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
the	1
anxiety	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
tended,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
even	1
less	1
so	1
than	1
usual.	1
About	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
then,	1
I	1
was	1
awakened	1
by	1
some	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
had	1
ceased	1
ere	1
I	1
was	1
wide	1
awake,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
left	1
an	1
impression	1
behind	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
window	1
had	1
gently	1
closed	1
somewhere.	1
I	1
lay	1
listening	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
ears.	1
Suddenly,	1
to	1
my	1
horror,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
distinct	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
moving	1
softly	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
I	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
all	1
palpitating	1
with	1
fear,	1
and	1
peeped	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
my	1
dressing-room	1
door.	1
	1
"'Arthur!'	1
I	1
screamed,	1
'you	1
villain!	1
you	1
thief!	1
How	1
dare	1
you	1
touch	1
that	1
coronet?'	1
	1
"The	1
gas	1
was	1
half	1
up,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
it,	1
and	1
my	1
unhappy	1
boy,	1
dressed	1
only	1
in	1
his	1
shirt	1
and	1
trousers,	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
light,	1
holding	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
wrenching	1
at	1
it,	1
or	1
bending	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
strength.	1
At	1
my	1
cry	1
he	1
dropped	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
grasp	1
and	1
turned	1
as	1
pale	1
as	1
death.	1
I	1
snatched	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
examined	1
it.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
corners,	1
with	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
beryls	1
in	1
it,	1
was	1
missing.	1
	1
"'You	1
blackguard!'	1
I	1
shouted,	1
beside	1
myself	1
with	1
rage.	1
'You	1
have	1
destroyed	1
it!	1
You	1
have	1
dishonoured	1
me	1
forever!	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
jewels	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
stolen?'	1
	1
"'Stolen!'	1
he	1
cried.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
thief!'	1
I	1
roared,	1
shaking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"'There	1
are	1
none	1
missing.	1
There	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
missing,'	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"'There	1
are	1
three	1
missing.	1
And	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are.	1
Must	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
a	1
liar	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
thief?	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
see	1
you	1
trying	1
to	1
tear	1
off	1
another	1
piece?'	1
	1
"'You	1
have	1
called	1
me	1
names	1
enough,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I	1
will	1
not	1
stand	1
it	1
any	1
longer.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
another	1
word	1
about	1
this	1
business,	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
chosen	1
to	1
insult	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
your	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
own	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
world.'	1
	1
"'You	1
shall	1
leave	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
police!'	1
I	1
cried	1
half-mad	1
with	1
grief	1
and	1
rage.	1
'I	1
shall	1
have	1
this	1
matter	1
probed	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.'	1
	1
"'You	1
shall	1
learn	1
nothing	1
from	1
me,'	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
passion	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
nature.	1
'If	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
police,	1
let	1
the	1
police	1
find	1
what	1
they	1
can.'	1
	1
"By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
was	1
astir,	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
raised	1
my	1
voice	1
in	1
my	1
anger.	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
rush	1
into	1
my	1
room,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
and	1
of	1
Arthur's	1
face,	1
she	1
read	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
scream,	1
fell	1
down	1
senseless	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
I	1
sent	1
the	1
house-maid	1
for	1
the	1
police	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
investigation	1
into	1
their	1
hands	1
at	1
once.	1
When	1
the	1
inspector	1
and	1
a	1
constable	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
Arthur,	1
who	1
had	1
stood	1
sullenly	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
folded,	1
asked	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
charge	1
him	1
with	1
theft.	1
I	1
answered	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
private	1
matter,	1
but	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
public	1
one,	1
since	1
the	1
ruined	1
coronet	1
was	1
national	1
property.	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
should	1
have	1
its	1
way	1
in	1
everything.	1
	1
"'At	1
least,'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
arrested	1
at	1
once.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
your	1
advantage	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
mine	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
five	1
minutes.'	1
	1
"'That	1
you	1
may	1
get	1
away,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
conceal	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
stolen,'	1
said	1
I.	1
And	1
then,	1
realising	1
the	1
dreadful	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
placed,	1
I	1
implored	1
him	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
my	1
honour	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
far	1
greater	1
than	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
stake;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
threatened	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
scandal	1
which	1
would	1
convulse	1
the	1
nation.	1
He	1
might	1
avert	1
it	1
all	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
missing	1
stones.	1
	1
"'You	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
face	1
the	1
matter,'	1
said	1
I;	1
'you	1
have	1
been	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
act,	1
and	1
no	1
confession	1
could	1
make	1
your	1
guilt	1
more	1
heinous.	1
If	1
you	1
but	1
make	1
such	1
reparation	1
as	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
power,	1
by	1
telling	1
us	1
where	1
the	1
beryls	1
are,	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
and	1
forgotten.'	1
	1
"'Keep	1
your	1
forgiveness	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
ask	1
for	1
it,'	1
he	1
answered,	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
sneer.	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
hardened	1
for	1
any	1
words	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
influence	1
him.	1
There	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
way	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
inspector	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
into	1
custody.	1
A	1
search	1
was	1
made	1
at	1
once	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
person	1
but	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
possibly	1
have	1
concealed	1
the	1
gems;	1
but	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
be	1
found,	1
nor	1
would	1
the	1
wretched	1
boy	1
open	1
his	1
mouth	1
for	1
all	1
our	1
persuasions	1
and	1
our	1
threats.	1
This	1
morning	1
he	1
was	1
removed	1
to	1
a	1
cell,	1
and	1
I,	1
after	1
going	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
police	1
formalities,	1
have	1
hurried	1
round	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
implore	1
you	1
to	1
use	1
your	1
skill	1
in	1
unravelling	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
police	1
have	1
openly	1
confessed	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
at	1
present	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
expense	1
which	1
you	1
think	1
necessary.	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
offered	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
1000	1
pounds.	1
My	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do!	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
my	1
honour,	1
my	1
gems,	1
and	1
my	1
son	1
in	1
one	1
night.	1
Oh,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do!"	1
	1
He	1
put	1
a	1
hand	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
rocked	1
himself	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
droning	1
to	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
whose	1
grief	1
has	1
got	1
beyond	1
words.	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sat	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
few	1
minutes,	1
with	1
his	1
brows	1
knitted	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
receive	1
much	1
company?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"None	1
save	1
my	1
partner	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
an	1
occasional	1
friend	1
of	1
Arthur's.	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
has	1
been	1
several	1
times	1
lately.	1
No	1
one	1
else,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
go	1
out	1
much	1
in	1
society?"	1
	1
"Arthur	1
does.	1
Mary	1
and	1
I	1
stay	1
at	1
home.	1
We	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
care	1
for	1
it."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
unusual	1
in	1
a	1
young	1
girl."	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
quiet	1
nature.	1
Besides,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
young.	1
She	1
is	1
four-and-twenty."	1
	1
"This	1
matter,	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
her	1
also."	1
	1
"Terrible!	1
She	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
affected	1
than	1
I."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
neither	1
of	1
you	1
any	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
son's	1
guilt?"	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
we	1
have	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands."	1
	1
"I	1
hardly	1
consider	1
that	1
a	1
conclusive	1
proof.	1
Was	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
at	1
all	1
injured?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
was	1
twisted."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
think,	1
then,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
straighten	1
it?"	1
	1
"God	1
bless	1
you!	1
You	1
are	1
doing	1
what	1
you	1
can	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
me.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
heavy	1
a	1
task.	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
doing	1
there	1
at	1
all?	1
If	1
his	1
purpose	1
were	1
innocent,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
say	1
so?"	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
guilty,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
invent	1
a	1
lie?	1
His	1
silence	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
cut	1
both	1
ways.	1
There	1
are	1
several	1
singular	1
points	1
about	1
the	1
case.	1
What	1
did	1
the	1
police	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
noise	1
which	1
awoke	1
you	1
from	1
your	1
sleep?"	1
	1
"They	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
caused	1
by	1
Arthur's	1
closing	1
his	1
bedroom	1
door."	1
	1
"A	1
likely	1
story!	1
As	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
bent	1
on	1
felony	1
would	1
slam	1
his	1
door	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
wake	1
a	1
household.	1
What	1
did	1
they	1
say,	1
then,	1
of	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
these	1
gems?"	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
still	1
sounding	1
the	1
planking	1
and	1
probing	1
the	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
finding	1
them."	1
	1
"Have	1
they	1
thought	1
of	1
looking	1
outside	1
the	1
house?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
have	1
shown	1
extraordinary	1
energy.	1
The	1
whole	1
garden	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
minutely	1
examined."	1
	1
"Now,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"is	1
it	1
not	1
obvious	1
to	1
you	1
now	1
that	1
this	1
matter	1
really	1
strikes	1
very	1
much	1
deeper	1
than	1
either	1
you	1
or	1
the	1
police	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
inclined	1
to	1
think?	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
simple	1
case;	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
seems	1
exceedingly	1
complex.	1
Consider	1
what	1
is	1
involved	1
by	1
your	1
theory.	1
You	1
suppose	1
that	1
your	1
son	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
bed,	1
went,	1
at	1
great	1
risk,	1
to	1
your	1
dressing-room,	1
opened	1
your	1
bureau,	1
took	1
out	1
your	1
coronet,	1
broke	1
off	1
by	1
main	1
force	1
a	1
small	1
portion	1
of	1
it,	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
place,	1
concealed	1
three	1
gems	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thirty-nine,	1
with	1
such	1
skill	1
that	1
nobody	1
can	1
find	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
thirty-six	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
exposed	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
discovered.	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
now,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
theory	1
tenable?"	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
other	1
is	1
there?"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair.	1
"If	1
his	1
motives	1
were	1
innocent,	1
why	1
does	1
he	1
not	1
explain	1
them?"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
our	1
task	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
out,"	1
replied	1
Holmes;	1
"so	1
now,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
we	1
will	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Streatham	1
together,	1
and	1
devote	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
glancing	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
closely	1
into	1
details."	1
	1
My	1
friend	1
insisted	1
upon	1
my	1
accompanying	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
expedition,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
eager	1
enough	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
my	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy	1
were	1
deeply	1
stirred	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
had	1
listened.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
the	1
banker's	1
son	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
obvious	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
to	1
his	1
unhappy	1
father,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
had	1
such	1
faith	1
in	1
Holmes'	1
judgment	1
that	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
grounds	1
for	1
hope	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
accepted	1
explanation.	1
He	1
hardly	1
spoke	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
whole	1
way	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
southern	1
suburb,	1
but	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
chin	1
upon	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
his	1
hat	1
drawn	1
over	1
his	1
eyes,	1
sunk	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
thought.	1
Our	1
client	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
fresh	1
heart	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
glimpse	1
of	1
hope	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
even	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
desultory	1
chat	1
with	1
me	1
over	1
his	1
business	1
affairs.	1
A	1
short	1
railway	1
journey	1
and	1
a	1
shorter	1
walk	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
Fairbank,	1
the	1
modest	1
residence	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
financier.	1
	1
Fairbank	1
was	1
a	1
good-sized	1
square	1
house	1
of	1
white	1
stone,	1
standing	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
road.	1
A	1
double	1
carriage-sweep,	1
with	1
a	1
snow-clad	1
lawn,	1
stretched	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
two	1
large	1
iron	1
gates	1
which	1
closed	1
the	1
entrance.	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
wooden	1
thicket,	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
narrow	1
path	1
between	1
two	1
neat	1
hedges	1
stretching	1
from	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
and	1
forming	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
entrance.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
ran	1
a	1
lane	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
stables,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
itself	1
within	1
the	1
grounds	1
at	1
all,	1
being	1
a	1
public,	1
though	1
little	1
used,	1
thoroughfare.	1
Holmes	1
left	1
us	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
walked	1
slowly	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
house,	1
across	1
the	1
front,	1
down	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
path,	1
and	1
so	1
round	1
by	1
the	1
garden	1
behind	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
So	1
long	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Holder	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room	1
and	1
waited	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
until	1
he	1
should	1
return.	1
We	1
were	1
sitting	1
there	1
in	1
silence	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
was	1
rather	1
above	1
the	1
middle	1
height,	1
slim,	1
with	1
dark	1
hair	1
and	1
eyes,	1
which	1
seemed	1
the	1
darker	1
against	1
the	1
absolute	1
pallor	1
of	1
her	1
skin.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
such	1
deadly	1
paleness	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
face.	1
Her	1
lips,	1
too,	1
were	1
bloodless,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
flushed	1
with	1
crying.	1
As	1
she	1
swept	1
silently	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
impressed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
greater	1
sense	1
of	1
grief	1
than	1
the	1
banker	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
striking	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
evidently	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
strong	1
character,	1
with	1
immense	1
capacity	1
for	1
self-restraint.	1
Disregarding	1
my	1
presence,	1
she	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
passed	1
her	1
hand	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
sweet	1
womanly	1
caress.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
that	1
Arthur	1
should	1
be	1
liberated,	1
have	1
you	1
not,	1
dad?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
my	1
girl,	1
the	1
matter	1
must	1
be	1
probed	1
to	1
the	1
bottom."	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent.	1
You	1
know	1
what	1
woman's	1
instincts	1
are.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
having	1
acted	1
so	1
harshly."	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
he	1
silent,	1
then,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
innocent?"	1
	1
"Who	1
knows?	1
Perhaps	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
angry	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
suspect	1
him."	1
	1
"How	1
could	1
I	1
help	1
suspecting	1
him,	1
when	1
I	1
actually	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hand?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
do,	1
do	1
take	1
my	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
innocent.	1
Let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop	1
and	1
say	1
no	1
more.	1
It	1
is	1
so	1
dreadful	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Arthur	1
in	1
prison!"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
never	1
let	1
it	1
drop	1
until	1
the	1
gems	1
are	1
found--never,	1
Mary!	1
Your	1
affection	1
for	1
Arthur	1
blinds	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
awful	1
consequences	1
to	1
me.	1
Far	1
from	1
hushing	1
the	1
thing	1
up,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
gentleman	1
down	1
from	1
London	1
to	1
inquire	1
more	1
deeply	1
into	1
it."	1
	1
"This	1
gentleman?"	1
she	1
asked,	1
facing	1
round	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
"No,	1
his	1
friend.	1
He	1
wished	1
us	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone.	1
He	1
is	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
lane	1
now."	1
	1
"The	1
stable	1
lane?"	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
dark	1
eyebrows.	1
"What	1
can	1
he	1
hope	1
to	1
find	1
there?	1
Ah!	1
this,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
is	1
he.	1
I	1
trust,	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
succeed	1
in	1
proving,	1
what	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
my	1
cousin	1
Arthur	1
is	1
innocent	1
of	1
this	1
crime."	1
	1
"I	1
fully	1
share	1
your	1
opinion,	1
and	1
I	1
trust,	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
prove	1
it,"	1
returned	1
Holmes,	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
mat	1
to	1
knock	1
the	1
snow	1
from	1
his	1
shoes.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
addressing	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Holder.	1
Might	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
a	1
question	1
or	1
two?"	1
	1
"Pray	1
do,	1
sir,	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
help	1
to	1
clear	1
this	1
horrible	1
affair	1
up."	1
	1
"You	1
heard	1
nothing	1
yourself	1
last	1
night?"	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
until	1
my	1
uncle	1
here	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
loudly.	1
I	1
heard	1
that,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
down."	1
	1
"You	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
windows	1
and	1
doors	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
Did	1
you	1
fasten	1
all	1
the	1
windows?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Were	1
they	1
all	1
fastened	1
this	1
morning?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
sweetheart?	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
remarked	1
to	1
your	1
uncle	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
him?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
girl	1
who	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
heard	1
uncle's	1
remarks	1
about	1
the	1
coronet."	1
	1
"I	1
see.	1
You	1
infer	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
sweetheart,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
may	1
have	1
planned	1
the	1
robbery."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
vague	1
theories,"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
impatiently,	1
"when	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
Arthur	1
with	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands?"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
little,	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
We	1
must	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
that.	1
About	1
this	1
girl,	1
Miss	1
Holder.	1
You	1
saw	1
her	1
return	1
by	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
I	1
presume?"	1
	1
"Yes;	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
fastened	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
I	1
met	1
her	1
slipping	1
in.	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
man,	1
too,	1
in	1
the	1
gloom."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
him?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
green-grocer	1
who	1
brings	1
our	1
vegetables	1
round.	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
Francis	1
Prosper."	1
	1
"He	1
stood,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"to	1
the	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
door--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
farther	1
up	1
the	1
path	1
than	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
door?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
did."	1
	1
"And	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
wooden	1
leg?"	1
	1
Something	1
like	1
fear	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
expressive	1
black	1
eyes.	1
"Why,	1
you	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
magician,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that?"	1
She	1
smiled,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
answering	1
smile	1
in	1
Holmes'	1
thin,	1
eager	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
now	1
to	1
go	1
upstairs,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
shall	1
probably	1
wish	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
again.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
lower	1
windows	1
before	1
I	1
go	1
up."	1
	1
He	1
walked	1
swiftly	1
round	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
pausing	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
large	1
one	1
which	1
looked	1
from	1
the	1
hall	1
onto	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
This	1
he	1
opened	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
careful	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
sill	1
with	1
his	1
powerful	1
magnifying	1
lens.	1
"Now	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
upstairs,"	1
said	1
he	1
at	1
last.	1
	1
The	1
banker's	1
dressing-room	1
was	1
a	1
plainly	1
furnished	1
little	1
chamber,	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
carpet,	1
a	1
large	1
bureau,	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
mirror.	1
Holmes	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bureau	1
first	1
and	1
looked	1
hard	1
at	1
the	1
lock.	1
	1
"Which	1
key	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
open	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"That	1
which	1
my	1
son	1
himself	1
indicated--that	1
of	1
the	1
cupboard	1
of	1
the	1
lumber-room."	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
it	1
here?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
dressing-table."	1
	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
bureau.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
noiseless	1
lock,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
wake	1
you.	1
This	1
case,	1
I	1
presume,	1
contains	1
the	1
coronet.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it."	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
diadem	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
magnificent	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
jeweller's	1
art,	1
and	1
the	1
thirty-six	1
stones	1
were	1
the	1
finest	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen.	1
At	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coronet	1
was	1
a	1
cracked	1
edge,	1
where	1
a	1
corner	1
holding	1
three	1
gems	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
away.	1
	1
"Now,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"here	1
is	1
the	1
corner	1
which	1
corresponds	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
unfortunately	1
lost.	1
Might	1
I	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
break	1
it	1
off."	1
	1
The	1
banker	1
recoiled	1
in	1
horror.	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
trying,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
will."	1
Holmes	1
suddenly	1
bent	1
his	1
strength	1
upon	1
it,	1
but	1
without	1
result.	1
"I	1
feel	1
it	1
give	1
a	1
little,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"but,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
exceptionally	1
strong	1
in	1
the	1
fingers,	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
me	1
all	1
my	1
time	1
to	1
break	1
it.	1
An	1
ordinary	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
it.	1
Now,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
would	1
happen	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
break	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Holder?	1
There	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
noise	1
like	1
a	1
pistol	1
shot.	1
Do	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
happened	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
your	1
bed	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
it?"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
dark	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
grow	1
lighter	1
as	1
we	1
go.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Holder?"	1
	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
still	1
share	1
my	1
uncle's	1
perplexity."	1
	1
"Your	1
son	1
had	1
no	1
shoes	1
or	1
slippers	1
on	1
when	1
you	1
saw	1
him?"	1
	1
"He	1
had	1
nothing	1
on	1
save	1
only	1
his	1
trousers	1
and	1
shirt."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you.	1
We	1
have	1
certainly	1
been	1
favoured	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
luck	1
during	1
this	1
inquiry,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
entirely	1
our	1
own	1
fault	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
clearing	1
the	1
matter	1
up.	1
With	1
your	1
permission,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
continue	1
my	1
investigations	1
outside."	1
	1
He	1
went	1
alone,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
request,	1
for	1
he	1
explained	1
that	1
any	1
unnecessary	1
footmarks	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
task	1
more	1
difficult.	1
For	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
work,	1
returning	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
heavy	1
with	1
snow	1
and	1
his	1
features	1
as	1
inscrutable	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
now	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
see,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
he;	1
"I	1
can	1
serve	1
you	1
best	1
by	1
returning	1
to	1
my	1
rooms."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
gems,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
Where	1
are	1
they?"	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
tell."	1
	1
The	1
banker	1
wrung	1
his	1
hands.	1
"I	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
them	1
again!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"And	1
my	1
son?	1
You	1
give	1
me	1
hopes?"	1
	1
"My	1
opinion	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
altered."	1
	1
"Then,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
what	1
was	1
this	1
dark	1
business	1
which	1
was	1
acted	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
last	1
night?"	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
can	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
at	1
my	1
Baker	1
Street	1
rooms	1
to-morrow	1
morning	1
between	1
nine	1
and	1
ten	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
clearer.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
carte	1
blanche	1
to	1
act	1
for	1
you,	1
provided	1
only	1
that	1
I	1
get	1
back	1
the	1
gems,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
place	1
no	1
limit	1
on	1
the	1
sum	1
I	1
may	1
draw."	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
give	1
my	1
fortune	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
back."	1
	1
"Very	1
good.	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
then.	1
Good-bye;	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
here	1
again	1
before	1
evening."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
obvious	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
companion's	1
mind	1
was	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
about	1
the	1
case,	1
although	1
what	1
his	1
conclusions	1
were	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
even	1
dimly	1
imagine.	1
Several	1
times	1
during	1
our	1
homeward	1
journey	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
sound	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
point,	1
but	1
he	1
always	1
glided	1
away	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
topic,	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
I	1
gave	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
despair.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
three	1
when	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
our	1
rooms	1
once	1
more.	1
He	1
hurried	1
to	1
his	1
chamber	1
and	1
was	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
common	1
loafer.	1
With	1
his	1
collar	1
turned	1
up,	1
his	1
shiny,	1
seedy	1
coat,	1
his	1
red	1
cravat,	1
and	1
his	1
worn	1
boots,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
perfect	1
sample	1
of	1
the	1
class.	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
do,"	1
said	1
he,	1
glancing	1
into	1
the	1
glass	1
above	1
the	1
fireplace.	1
"I	1
only	1
wish	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
Watson,	1
but	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
it	1
won't	1
do.	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
trail	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
or	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
following	1
a	1
will-o'-the-wisp,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
know	1
which	1
it	1
is.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours."	1
He	1
cut	1
a	1
slice	1
of	1
beef	1
from	1
the	1
joint	1
upon	1
the	1
sideboard,	1
sandwiched	1
it	1
between	1
two	1
rounds	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
this	1
rude	1
meal	1
into	1
his	1
pocket	1
he	1
started	1
off	1
upon	1
his	1
expedition.	1
	1
I	1
had	1
just	1
finished	1
my	1
tea	1
when	1
he	1
returned,	1
evidently	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits,	1
swinging	1
an	1
old	1
elastic-sided	1
boot	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
He	1
chucked	1
it	1
down	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
and	1
helped	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
	1
"I	1
only	1
looked	1
in	1
as	1
I	1
passed,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
right	1
on."	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
End.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
I	1
get	1
back.	1
Don't	1
wait	1
up	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
case	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
late."	1
	1
"How	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
so	1
so.	1
Nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
to	1
Streatham	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
last,	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
little	1
problem,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
missed	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal.	1
However,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
sit	1
gossiping	1
here,	1
but	1
must	1
get	1
these	1
disreputable	1
clothes	1
off	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
highly	1
respectable	1
self."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
stronger	1
reasons	1
for	1
satisfaction	1
than	1
his	1
words	1
alone	1
would	1
imply.	1
His	1
eyes	1
twinkled,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
even	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
colour	1
upon	1
his	1
sallow	1
cheeks.	1
He	1
hastened	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
slam	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
off	1
once	1
more	1
upon	1
his	1
congenial	1
hunt.	1
	1
I	1
waited	1
until	1
midnight,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
his	1
return,	1
so	1
I	1
retired	1
to	1
my	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
uncommon	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
for	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
on	1
end	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
hot	1
upon	1
a	1
scent,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
lateness	1
caused	1
me	1
no	1
surprise.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
at	1
what	1
hour	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
trim	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
beginning	1
without	1
you,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
our	1
client	1
has	1
rather	1
an	1
early	1
appointment	1
this	1
morning."	1
	1
"Why,	1
it	1
is	1
after	1
nine	1
now,"	1
I	1
answered.	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
he.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
ring."	1
	1
It	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
our	1
friend	1
the	1
financier.	1
I	1
was	1
shocked	1
by	1
the	1
change	1
which	1
had	1
come	1
over	1
him,	1
for	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
was	1
naturally	1
of	1
a	1
broad	1
and	1
massive	1
mould,	1
was	1
now	1
pinched	1
and	1
fallen	1
in,	1
while	1
his	1
hair	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
shade	1
whiter.	1
He	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
weariness	1
and	1
lethargy	1
which	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
his	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
before,	1
and	1
he	1
dropped	1
heavily	1
into	1
the	1
armchair	1
which	1
I	1
pushed	1
forward	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
severely	1
tried,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Only	1
two	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
prosperous	1
man,	1
without	1
a	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
to	1
a	1
lonely	1
and	1
dishonoured	1
age.	1
One	1
sorrow	1
comes	1
close	1
upon	1
the	1
heels	1
of	1
another.	1
My	1
niece,	1
Mary,	1
has	1
deserted	1
me."	1
	1
"Deserted	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes.	1
Her	1
bed	1
this	1
morning	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
slept	1
in,	1
her	1
room	1
was	1
empty,	1
and	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
me	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
hall	1
table.	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
last	1
night,	1
in	1
sorrow	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
anger,	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
married	1
my	1
boy	1
all	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
with	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
thoughtless	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
so.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
that	1
remark	1
that	1
she	1
refers	1
in	1
this	1
note:	1
	1
"'MY	1
DEAREST	1
UNCLE:--I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
trouble	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
acted	1
differently	1
this	1
terrible	1
misfortune	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
occurred.	1
I	1
cannot,	1
with	1
this	1
thought	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
ever	1
again	1
be	1
happy	1
under	1
your	1
roof,	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you	1
forever.	1
Do	1
not	1
worry	1
about	1
my	1
future,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
provided	1
for;	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
do	1
not	1
search	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
fruitless	1
labour	1
and	1
an	1
ill-service	1
to	1
me.	1
In	1
life	1
or	1
in	1
death,	1
I	1
am	1
ever	1
your	1
loving,--MARY.'	1
	1
"What	1
could	1
she	1
mean	1
by	1
that	1
note,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
points	1
to	1
suicide?"	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
solution.	1
I	1
trust,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
nearing	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
troubles."	1
	1
"Ha!	1
You	1
say	1
so!	1
You	1
have	1
heard	1
something,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes;	1
you	1
have	1
learned	1
something!	1
Where	1
are	1
the	1
gems?"	1
	1
"You	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
1000	1
pounds	1
apiece	1
an	1
excessive	1
sum	1
for	1
them?"	1
	1
"I	1
would	1
pay	1
ten."	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary.	1
Three	1
thousand	1
will	1
cover	1
the	1
matter.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
reward,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Have	1
you	1
your	1
check-book?	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
pen.	1
Better	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
4000	1
pounds."	1
	1
With	1
a	1
dazed	1
face	1
the	1
banker	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
required	1
check.	1
Holmes	1
walked	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
desk,	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
triangular	1
piece	1
of	1
gold	1
with	1
three	1
gems	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
With	1
a	1
shriek	1
of	1
joy	1
our	1
client	1
clutched	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
it!"	1
he	1
gasped.	1
"I	1
am	1
saved!	1
I	1
am	1
saved!"	1
	1
The	1
reaction	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
as	1
passionate	1
as	1
his	1
grief	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
he	1
hugged	1
his	1
recovered	1
gems	1
to	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
other	1
thing	1
you	1
owe,	1
Mr.	1
Holder,"	1
said	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
rather	1
sternly.	1
	1
"Owe!"	1
He	1
caught	1
up	1
a	1
pen.	1
"Name	1
the	1
sum,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
it."	1
	1
"No,	1
the	1
debt	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
me.	1
You	1
owe	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
apology	1
to	1
that	1
noble	1
lad,	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
has	1
carried	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
proud	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
own	1
son	1
do,	1
should	1
I	1
ever	1
chance	1
to	1
have	1
one."	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
Arthur	1
who	1
took	1
them?"	1
	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
I	1
repeat	1
to-day,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
sure	1
of	1
it!	1
Then	1
let	1
us	1
hurry	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
known."	1
	1
"He	1
knows	1
it	1
already.	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
cleared	1
it	1
all	1
up	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
story,	1
I	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
to	1
add	1
the	1
very	1
few	1
details	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
yet	1
quite	1
clear	1
to	1
me.	1
Your	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
morning,	1
however,	1
may	1
open	1
his	1
lips."	1
	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake,	1
tell	1
me,	1
then,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
mystery!"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
reached	1
it.	1
And	1
let	1
me	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
first,	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
hardest	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
hear:	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
understanding	1
between	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
and	1
your	1
niece	1
Mary.	1
They	1
have	1
now	1
fled	1
together."	1
	1
"My	1
Mary?	1
Impossible!"	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
unfortunately	1
more	1
than	1
possible;	1
it	1
is	1
certain.	1
Neither	1
you	1
nor	1
your	1
son	1
knew	1
the	1
true	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
when	1
you	1
admitted	1
him	1
into	1
your	1
family	1
circle.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
dangerous	1
men	1
in	1
England--a	1
ruined	1
gambler,	1
an	1
absolutely	1
desperate	1
villain,	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
heart	1
or	1
conscience.	1
Your	1
niece	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
such	1
men.	1
When	1
he	1
breathed	1
his	1
vows	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
a	1
hundred	1
before	1
her,	1
she	1
flattered	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
alone	1
had	1
touched	1
his	1
heart.	1
The	1
devil	1
knows	1
best	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
she	1
became	1
his	1
tool	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
nearly	1
every	1
evening."	1
	1
"I	1
cannot,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not,	1
believe	1
it!"	1
cried	1
the	1
banker	1
with	1
an	1
ashen	1
face.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
then,	1
what	1
occurred	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
last	1
night.	1
Your	1
niece,	1
when	1
you	1
had,	1
as	1
she	1
thought,	1
gone	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
slipped	1
down	1
and	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
lover	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
which	1
leads	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane.	1
His	1
footmarks	1
had	1
pressed	1
right	1
through	1
the	1
snow,	1
so	1
long	1
had	1
he	1
stood	1
there.	1
She	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
coronet.	1
His	1
wicked	1
lust	1
for	1
gold	1
kindled	1
at	1
the	1
news,	1
and	1
he	1
bent	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
loved	1
you,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
women	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
a	1
lover	1
extinguishes	1
all	1
other	1
loves,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
one.	1
She	1
had	1
hardly	1
listened	1
to	1
his	1
instructions	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
you	1
coming	1
downstairs,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
closed	1
the	1
window	1
rapidly	1
and	1
told	1
you	1
about	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants'	1
escapade	1
with	1
her	1
wooden-legged	1
lover,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
	1
"Your	1
boy,	1
Arthur,	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
after	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
you	1
but	1
he	1
slept	1
badly	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
his	1
club	1
debts.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
soft	1
tread	1
pass	1
his	1
door,	1
so	1
he	1
rose	1
and,	1
looking	1
out,	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
cousin	1
walking	1
very	1
stealthily	1
along	1
the	1
passage	1
until	1
she	1
disappeared	1
into	1
your	1
dressing-room.	1
Petrified	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
the	1
lad	1
slipped	1
on	1
some	1
clothes	1
and	1
waited	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
affair.	1
Presently	1
she	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
again,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
passage-lamp	1
your	1
son	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
carried	1
the	1
precious	1
coronet	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
She	1
passed	1
down	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
he,	1
thrilling	1
with	1
horror,	1
ran	1
along	1
and	1
slipped	1
behind	1
the	1
curtain	1
near	1
your	1
door,	1
whence	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
beneath.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
stealthily	1
open	1
the	1
window,	1
hand	1
out	1
the	1
coronet	1
to	1
someone	1
in	1
the	1
gloom,	1
and	1
then	1
closing	1
it	1
once	1
more	1
hurry	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
passing	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
hid	1
behind	1
the	1
curtain.	1
	1
"As	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
action	1
without	1
a	1
horrible	1
exposure	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
loved.	1
But	1
the	1
instant	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
he	1
realised	1
how	1
crushing	1
a	1
misfortune	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
how	1
all-important	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
right.	1
He	1
rushed	1
down,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
in	1
his	1
bare	1
feet,	1
opened	1
the	1
window,	1
sprang	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
snow,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
lane,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
dark	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
moonlight.	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
but	1
Arthur	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
struggle	1
between	1
them,	1
your	1
lad	1
tugging	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
coronet,	1
and	1
his	1
opponent	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
scuffle,	1
your	1
son	1
struck	1
Sir	1
George	1
and	1
cut	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
eye.	1
Then	1
something	1
suddenly	1
snapped,	1
and	1
your	1
son,	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
coronet	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
rushed	1
back,	1
closed	1
the	1
window,	1
ascended	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
had	1
just	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
coronet	1
had	1
been	1
twisted	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
and	1
was	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
straighten	1
it	1
when	1
you	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1
scene."	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
gasped	1
the	1
banker.	1
	1
"You	1
then	1
roused	1
his	1
anger	1
by	1
calling	1
him	1
names	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
deserved	1
your	1
warmest	1
thanks.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
explain	1
the	1
true	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
without	1
betraying	1
one	1
who	1
certainly	1
deserved	1
little	1
enough	1
consideration	1
at	1
his	1
hands.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
more	1
chivalrous	1
view,	1
however,	1
and	1
preserved	1
her	1
secret."	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
she	1
shrieked	1
and	1
fainted	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
coronet,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
what	1
a	1
blind	1
fool	1
I	1
have	1
been!	1
And	1
his	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
for	1
five	1
minutes!	1
The	1
dear	1
fellow	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
missing	1
piece	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
struggle.	1
How	1
cruelly	1
I	1
have	1
misjudged	1
him!"	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
house,"	1
continued	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
at	1
once	1
went	1
very	1
carefully	1
round	1
it	1
to	1
observe	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
which	1
might	1
help	1
me.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
none	1
had	1
fallen	1
since	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
strong	1
frost	1
to	1
preserve	1
impressions.	1
I	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
tradesmen's	1
path,	1
but	1
found	1
it	1
all	1
trampled	1
down	1
and	1
indistinguishable.	1
Just	1
beyond	1
it,	1
however,	1
at	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door,	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
a	1
man,	1
whose	1
round	1
impressions	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wooden	1
leg.	1
I	1
could	1
even	1
tell	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
disturbed,	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
run	1
back	1
swiftly	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
as	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
the	1
deep	1
toe	1
and	1
light	1
heel	1
marks,	1
while	1
Wooden-leg	1
had	1
waited	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
then	1
had	1
gone	1
away.	1
I	1
thought	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
maid	1
and	1
her	1
sweetheart,	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
had	1
already	1
spoken	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
inquiry	1
showed	1
it	1
was	1
so.	1
I	1
passed	1
round	1
the	1
garden	1
without	1
seeing	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
random	1
tracks,	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
police;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
lane	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
complex	1
story	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
line	1
of	1
tracks	1
of	1
a	1
booted	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
double	1
line	1
which	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
delight	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
naked	1
feet.	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
convinced	1
from	1
what	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
your	1
son.	1
The	1
first	1
had	1
walked	1
both	1
ways,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
run	1
swiftly,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
tread	1
was	1
marked	1
in	1
places	1
over	1
the	1
depression	1
of	1
the	1
boot,	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
followed	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
found	1
they	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
window,	1
where	1
Boots	1
had	1
worn	1
all	1
the	1
snow	1
away	1
while	1
waiting.	1
Then	1
I	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
or	1
more	1
down	1
the	1
lane.	1
I	1
saw	1
where	1
Boots	1
had	1
faced	1
round,	1
where	1
the	1
snow	1
was	1
cut	1
up	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
struggle,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
drops	1
of	1
blood	1
had	1
fallen,	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
Boots	1
had	1
then	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
lane,	1
and	1
another	1
little	1
smudge	1
of	1
blood	1
showed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
hurt.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
highroad	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end,	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
pavement	1
had	1
been	1
cleared,	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
that	1
clue.	1
	1
"On	1
entering	1
the	1
house,	1
however,	1
I	1
examined,	1
as	1
you	1
remember,	1
the	1
sill	1
and	1
framework	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
window	1
with	1
my	1
lens,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
at	1
once	1
see	1
that	1
someone	1
had	1
passed	1
out.	1
I	1
could	1
distinguish	1
the	1
outline	1
of	1
an	1
instep	1
where	1
the	1
wet	1
foot	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
coming	1
in.	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
had	1
occurred.	1
A	1
man	1
had	1
waited	1
outside	1
the	1
window;	1
someone	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
gems;	1
the	1
deed	1
had	1
been	1
overseen	1
by	1
your	1
son;	1
he	1
had	1
pursued	1
the	1
thief;	1
had	1
struggled	1
with	1
him;	1
they	1
had	1
each	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
coronet,	1
their	1
united	1
strength	1
causing	1
injuries	1
which	1
neither	1
alone	1
could	1
have	1
effected.	1
He	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
prize,	1
but	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
fragment	1
in	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
his	1
opponent.	1
So	1
far	1
I	1
was	1
clear.	1
The	1
question	1
now	1
was,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
it	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
coronet?	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
maxim	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
excluded	1
the	1
impossible,	1
whatever	1
remains,	1
however	1
improbable,	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
truth.	1
Now,	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
you	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
down,	1
so	1
there	1
only	1
remained	1
your	1
niece	1
and	1
the	1
maids.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
maids,	1
why	1
should	1
your	1
son	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
in	1
their	1
place?	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possible	1
reason.	1
As	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
cousin,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
explanation	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
retain	1
her	1
secret--the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
secret	1
was	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
one.	1
When	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
at	1
that	1
window,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
fainted	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
coronet	1
again,	1
my	1
conjecture	1
became	1
a	1
certainty.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
who	1
was	1
her	1
confederate?	1
A	1
lover	1
evidently,	1
for	1
who	1
else	1
could	1
outweigh	1
the	1
love	1
and	1
gratitude	1
which	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
to	1
you?	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
you	1
went	1
out	1
little,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
circle	1
of	1
friends	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
limited	1
one.	1
But	1
among	1
them	1
was	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell.	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
before	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
evil	1
reputation	1
among	1
women.	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
who	1
wore	1
those	1
boots	1
and	1
retained	1
the	1
missing	1
gems.	1
Even	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Arthur	1
had	1
discovered	1
him,	1
he	1
might	1
still	1
flatter	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
safe,	1
for	1
the	1
lad	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
without	1
compromising	1
his	1
own	1
family.	1
	1
"Well,	1
your	1
own	1
good	1
sense	1
will	1
suggest	1
what	1
measures	1
I	1
took	1
next.	1
I	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
loafer	1
to	1
Sir	1
George's	1
house,	1
managed	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
his	1
valet,	1
learned	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
cut	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
and,	1
finally,	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
six	1
shillings,	1
made	1
all	1
sure	1
by	1
buying	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
his	1
cast-off	1
shoes.	1
With	1
these	1
I	1
journeyed	1
down	1
to	1
Streatham	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
they	1
exactly	1
fitted	1
the	1
tracks."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
an	1
ill-dressed	1
vagabond	1
in	1
the	1
lane	1
yesterday	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Holder.	1
	1
"Precisely.	1
It	1
was	1
I.	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
man,	1
so	1
I	1
came	1
home	1
and	1
changed	1
my	1
clothes.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
delicate	1
part	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
play	1
then,	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
a	1
prosecution	1
must	1
be	1
avoided	1
to	1
avert	1
scandal,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
so	1
astute	1
a	1
villain	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
our	1
hands	1
were	1
tied	1
in	1
the	1
matter.	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
saw	1
him.	1
At	1
first,	1
of	1
course,	1
he	1
denied	1
everything.	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
every	1
particular	1
that	1
had	1
occurred,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
bluster	1
and	1
took	1
down	1
a	1
life-preserver	1
from	1
the	1
wall.	1
I	1
knew	1
my	1
man,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
clapped	1
a	1
pistol	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
strike.	1
Then	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
reasonable.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
price	1
for	1
the	1
stones	1
he	1
held--1000	1
pounds	1
apiece.	1
That	1
brought	1
out	1
the	1
first	1
signs	1
of	1
grief	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shown.	1
'Why,	1
dash	1
it	1
all!'	1
said	1
he,	1
'I've	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
at	1
six	1
hundred	1
for	1
the	1
three!'	1
I	1
soon	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
receiver	1
who	1
had	1
them,	1
on	1
promising	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
prosecution.	1
Off	1
I	1
set	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
after	1
much	1
chaffering	1
I	1
got	1
our	1
stones	1
at	1
1000	1
pounds	1
apiece.	1
Then	1
I	1
looked	1
in	1
upon	1
your	1
son,	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
right,	1
and	1
eventually	1
got	1
to	1
my	1
bed	1
about	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
after	1
what	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
a	1
really	1
hard	1
day's	1
work."	1
	1
"A	1
day	1
which	1
has	1
saved	1
England	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
public	1
scandal,"	1
said	1
the	1
banker,	1
rising.	1
"Sir,	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
thank	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
ungrateful	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done.	1
Your	1
skill	1
has	1
indeed	1
exceeded	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
must	1
fly	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
boy	1
to	1
apologise	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
him.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
poor	1
Mary,	1
it	1
goes	1
to	1
my	1
very	1
heart.	1
Not	1
even	1
your	1
skill	1
can	1
inform	1
me	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
now."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
safely	1
say,"	1
returned	1
Holmes,	1
"that	1
she	1
is	1
wherever	1
Sir	1
George	1
Burnwell	1
is.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
certain,	1
too,	1
that	1
whatever	1
her	1
sins	1
are,	1
they	1
will	1
soon	1
receive	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
sufficient	1
punishment."	1
	1

THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
COPPER	1
BEECHES	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
art	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake,"	1
remarked	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes,	1
tossing	1
aside	1
the	1
advertisement	1
sheet	1
of	1
the	1
Daily	1
Telegraph,	1
"it	1
is	1
frequently	1
in	1
its	1
least	1
important	1
and	1
lowliest	1
manifestations	1
that	1
the	1
keenest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
derived.	1
It	1
is	1
pleasant	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
observe,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
far	1
grasped	1
this	1
truth	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
little	1
records	1
of	1
our	1
cases	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
draw	1
up,	1
and,	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
say,	1
occasionally	1
to	1
embellish,	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
prominence	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
many	1
causes	1
célèbres	1
and	1
sensational	1
trials	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
figured	1
but	1
rather	1
to	1
those	1
incidents	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
trivial	1
in	1
themselves,	1
but	1
which	1
have	1
given	1
room	1
for	1
those	1
faculties	1
of	1
deduction	1
and	1
of	1
logical	1
synthesis	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
special	1
province."	1
	1
"And	1
yet,"	1
said	1
I,	1
smiling,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
quite	1
hold	1
myself	1
absolved	1
from	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
sensationalism	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
urged	1
against	1
my	1
records."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
erred,	1
perhaps,"	1
he	1
observed,	1
taking	1
up	1
a	1
glowing	1
cinder	1
with	1
the	1
tongs	1
and	1
lighting	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
long	1
cherry-wood	1
pipe	1
which	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
replace	1
his	1
clay	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
disputatious	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
meditative	1
mood--"you	1
have	1
erred	1
perhaps	1
in	1
attempting	1
to	1
put	1
colour	1
and	1
life	1
into	1
each	1
of	1
your	1
statements	1
instead	1
of	1
confining	1
yourself	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
placing	1
upon	1
record	1
that	1
severe	1
reasoning	1
from	1
cause	1
to	1
effect	1
which	1
is	1
really	1
the	1
only	1
notable	1
feature	1
about	1
the	1
thing."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
you	1
full	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
matter,"	1
I	1
remarked	1
with	1
some	1
coldness,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
repelled	1
by	1
the	1
egotism	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
strong	1
factor	1
in	1
my	1
friend's	1
singular	1
character.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
selfishness	1
or	1
conceit,"	1
said	1
he,	1
answering,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
my	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
my	1
words.	1
"If	1
I	1
claim	1
full	1
justice	1
for	1
my	1
art,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
impersonal	1
thing--a	1
thing	1
beyond	1
myself.	1
Crime	1
is	1
common.	1
Logic	1
is	1
rare.	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
logic	1
rather	1
than	1
upon	1
the	1
crime	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
dwell.	1
You	1
have	1
degraded	1
what	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
lectures	1
into	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
tales."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cold	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
spring,	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
after	1
breakfast	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
cheery	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
room	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
A	1
thick	1
fog	1
rolled	1
down	1
between	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
dun-coloured	1
houses,	1
and	1
the	1
opposing	1
windows	1
loomed	1
like	1
dark,	1
shapeless	1
blurs	1
through	1
the	1
heavy	1
yellow	1
wreaths.	1
Our	1
gas	1
was	1
lit	1
and	1
shone	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
cloth	1
and	1
glimmer	1
of	1
china	1
and	1
metal,	1
for	1
the	1
table	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
cleared	1
yet.	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
all	1
the	1
morning,	1
dipping	1
continuously	1
into	1
the	1
advertisement	1
columns	1
of	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
papers	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
having	1
apparently	1
given	1
up	1
his	1
search,	1
he	1
had	1
emerged	1
in	1
no	1
very	1
sweet	1
temper	1
to	1
lecture	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
literary	1
shortcomings.	1
	1
"At	1
the	1
same	1
time,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sat	1
puffing	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
pipe	1
and	1
gazing	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
"you	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
sensationalism,	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
cases	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
interest	1
yourself	1
in,	1
a	1
fair	1
proportion	1
do	1
not	1
treat	1
of	1
crime,	1
in	1
its	1
legal	1
sense,	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
small	1
matter	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
the	1
singular	1
experience	1
of	1
Miss	1
Mary	1
Sutherland,	1
the	1
problem	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
twisted	1
lip,	1
and	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
noble	1
bachelor,	1
were	1
all	1
matters	1
which	1
are	1
outside	1
the	1
pale	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
But	1
in	1
avoiding	1
the	1
sensational,	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
bordered	1
on	1
the	1
trivial."	1
	1
"The	1
end	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
so,"	1
I	1
answered,	1
"but	1
the	1
methods	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
novel	1
and	1
of	1
interest."	1
	1
"Pshaw,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
do	1
the	1
public,	1
the	1
great	1
unobservant	1
public,	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
tell	1
a	1
weaver	1
by	1
his	1
tooth	1
or	1
a	1
compositor	1
by	1
his	1
left	1
thumb,	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
finer	1
shades	1
of	1
analysis	1
and	1
deduction!	1
But,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
trivial,	1
I	1
cannot	1
blame	1
you,	1
for	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
cases	1
are	1
past.	1
Man,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
criminal	1
man,	1
has	1
lost	1
all	1
enterprise	1
and	1
originality.	1
As	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
practice,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
degenerating	1
into	1
an	1
agency	1
for	1
recovering	1
lost	1
lead	1
pencils	1
and	1
giving	1
advice	1
to	1
young	1
ladies	1
from	1
boarding-schools.	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
touched	1
bottom	1
at	1
last,	1
however.	1
This	1
note	1
I	1
had	1
this	1
morning	1
marks	1
my	1
zero-point,	1
I	1
fancy.	1
Read	1
it!"	1
He	1
tossed	1
a	1
crumpled	1
letter	1
across	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
dated	1
from	1
Montague	1
Place	1
upon	1
the	1
preceding	1
evening,	1
and	1
ran	1
thus:	1
	1
"DEAR	1
MR.	1
HOLMES:--I	1
am	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
I	1
should	1
or	1
should	1
not	1
accept	1
a	1
situation	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
governess.	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
at	1
half-past	1
ten	1
to-morrow	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
inconvenience	1
you.	1
Yours	1
faithfully,	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1

	1
	1
	1

	1
	1
	1
	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1

	1
	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
"VIOLET	1
HUNTER."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
young	1
lady?"	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"Not	1
I."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
half-past	1
ten	1
now."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
is	1
her	1
ring."	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
you	1
think.	1
You	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
carbuncle,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mere	1
whim	1
at	1
first,	1
developed	1
into	1
a	1
serious	1
investigation.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
also."	1
	1
"Well,	1
let	1
us	1
hope	1
so.	1
But	1
our	1
doubts	1
will	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
solved,	1
for	1
here,	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
is	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
question."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
the	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
was	1
plainly	1
but	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
with	1
a	1
bright,	1
quick	1
face,	1
freckled	1
like	1
a	1
plover's	1
egg,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
brisk	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
her	1
own	1
way	1
to	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
troubling	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
my	1
companion	1
rose	1
to	1
greet	1
her,	1
"but	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
experience,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
parents	1
or	1
relations	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
could	1
ask	1
advice,	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
kind	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do."	1
	1
"Pray	1
take	1
a	1
seat,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
serve	1
you."	1
	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
Holmes	1
was	1
favourably	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
speech	1
of	1
his	1
new	1
client.	1
He	1
looked	1
her	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
searching	1
fashion,	1
and	1
then	1
composed	1
himself,	1
with	1
his	1
lids	1
drooping	1
and	1
his	1
finger-tips	1
together,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
story.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
governess	1
for	1
five	1
years,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Spence	1
Munro,	1
but	1
two	1
months	1
ago	1
the	1
colonel	1
received	1
an	1
appointment	1
at	1
Halifax,	1
in	1
Nova	1
Scotia,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
children	1
over	1
to	1
America	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
without	1
a	1
situation.	1
I	1
advertised,	1
and	1
I	1
answered	1
advertisements,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
little	1
money	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
saved	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
short,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
well-known	1
agency	1
for	1
governesses	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
End	1
called	1
Westaway's,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
about	1
once	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
anything	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
which	1
might	1
suit	1
me.	1
Westaway	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
managed	1
by	1
Miss	1
Stoper.	1
She	1
sits	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
little	1
office,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
seeking	1
employment	1
wait	1
in	1
an	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
are	1
then	1
shown	1
in	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
when	1
she	1
consults	1
her	1
ledgers	1
and	1
sees	1
whether	1
she	1
has	1
anything	1
which	1
would	1
suit	1
them.	1
	1
"Well,	1
when	1
I	1
called	1
last	1
week	1
I	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
office	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
Miss	1
Stoper	1
was	1
not	1
alone.	1
A	1
prodigiously	1
stout	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
smiling	1
face	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
heavy	1
chin	1
which	1
rolled	1
down	1
in	1
fold	1
upon	1
fold	1
over	1
his	1
throat	1
sat	1
at	1
her	1
elbow	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
glasses	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
looking	1
very	1
earnestly	1
at	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
entered.	1
As	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
gave	1
quite	1
a	1
jump	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
turned	1
quickly	1
to	1
Miss	1
Stoper.	1
	1
"'That	1
will	1
do,'	1
said	1
he;	1
'I	1
could	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
anything	1
better.	1
Capital!	1
capital!'	1
He	1
seemed	1
quite	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
rubbed	1
his	1
hands	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
genial	1
fashion.	1
He	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
comfortable-looking	1
man	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"'You	1
are	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
situation,	1
miss?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
sir.'	1
	1
"'As	1
governess?'	1
	1
"'Yes,	1
sir.'	1
	1
"'And	1
what	1
salary	1
do	1
you	1
ask?'	1
	1
"'I	1
had	1
4	1
pounds	1
a	1
month	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
place	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Spence	1
Munro.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
tut,	1
tut!	1
sweating--rank	1
sweating!'	1
he	1
cried,	1
throwing	1
his	1
fat	1
hands	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
boiling	1
passion.	1
'How	1
could	1
anyone	1
offer	1
so	1
pitiful	1
a	1
sum	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
with	1
such	1
attractions	1
and	1
accomplishments?'	1
	1
"'My	1
accomplishments,	1
sir,	1
may	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
imagine,'	1
said	1
I.	1
'A	1
little	1
French,	1
a	1
little	1
German,	1
music,	1
and	1
drawing--'	1
	1
"'Tut,	1
tut!'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'This	1
is	1
all	1
quite	1
beside	1
the	1
question.	1
The	1
point	1
is,	1
have	1
you	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
not	1
the	1
bearing	1
and	1
deportment	1
of	1
a	1
lady?	1
There	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
nutshell.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
not,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
fitted	1
for	1
the	1
rearing	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
may	1
some	1
day	1
play	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
why,	1
then,	1
how	1
could	1
any	1
gentleman	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
condescend	1
to	1
accept	1
anything	1
under	1
the	1
three	1
figures?	1
Your	1
salary	1
with	1
me,	1
madam,	1
would	1
commence	1
at	1
100	1
pounds	1
a	1
year.'	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
destitute	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
such	1
an	1
offer	1
seemed	1
almost	1
too	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
true.	1
The	1
gentleman,	1
however,	1
seeing	1
perhaps	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
incredulity	1
upon	1
my	1
face,	1
opened	1
a	1
pocket-book	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
note.	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
also	1
my	1
custom,'	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
pleasant	1
fashion	1
until	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
just	1
two	1
little	1
shining	1
slits	1
amid	1
the	1
white	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
'to	1
advance	1
to	1
my	1
young	1
ladies	1
half	1
their	1
salary	1
beforehand,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
meet	1
any	1
little	1
expenses	1
of	1
their	1
journey	1
and	1
their	1
wardrobe.'	1
	1
"It	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
so	1
fascinating	1
and	1
so	1
thoughtful	1
a	1
man.	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
debt	1
to	1
my	1
tradesmen,	1
the	1
advance	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
convenience,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unnatural	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
transaction	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
before	1
I	1
quite	1
committed	1
myself.	1
	1
"'May	1
I	1
ask	1
where	1
you	1
live,	1
sir?'	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"'Hampshire.	1
Charming	1
rural	1
place.	1
The	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
five	1
miles	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
Winchester.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
lovely	1
country,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
the	1
dearest	1
old	1
country-house.'	1
	1
"'And	1
my	1
duties,	1
sir?	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
be.'	1
	1
"'One	1
child--one	1
dear	1
little	1
romper	1
just	1
six	1
years	1
old.	1
Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
killing	1
cockroaches	1
with	1
a	1
slipper!	1
Smack!	1
smack!	1
smack!	1
Three	1
gone	1
before	1
you	1
could	1
wink!'	1
He	1
leaned	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
laughed	1
his	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
again.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
at	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
child's	1
amusement,	1
but	1
the	1
father's	1
laughter	1
made	1
me	1
think	1
that	1
perhaps	1
he	1
was	1
joking.	1
	1
"'My	1
sole	1
duties,	1
then,'	1
I	1
asked,	1
'are	1
to	1
take	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
child?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
sole,	1
not	1
the	1
sole,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady,'	1
he	1
cried.	1
'Your	1
duty	1
would	1
be,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
your	1
good	1
sense	1
would	1
suggest,	1
to	1
obey	1
any	1
little	1
commands	1
my	1
wife	1
might	1
give,	1
provided	1
always	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
such	1
commands	1
as	1
a	1
lady	1
might	1
with	1
propriety	1
obey.	1
You	1
see	1
no	1
difficulty,	1
heh?'	1
	1
"'I	1
should	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
make	1
myself	1
useful.'	1
	1
"'Quite	1
so.	1
In	1
dress	1
now,	1
for	1
example.	1
We	1
are	1
faddy	1
people,	1
you	1
know--faddy	1
but	1
kind-hearted.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
asked	1
to	1
wear	1
any	1
dress	1
which	1
we	1
might	1
give	1
you,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
our	1
little	1
whim.	1
Heh?'	1
	1
"'No,'	1
said	1
I,	1
considerably	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"'Or	1
to	1
sit	1
here,	1
or	1
sit	1
there,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
offensive	1
to	1
you?'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
no.'	1
	1
"'Or	1
to	1
cut	1
your	1
hair	1
quite	1
short	1
before	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
us?'	1
	1
"I	1
could	1
hardly	1
believe	1
my	1
ears.	1
As	1
you	1
may	1
observe,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
my	1
hair	1
is	1
somewhat	1
luxuriant,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
peculiar	1
tint	1
of	1
chestnut.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
considered	1
artistic.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
dream	1
of	1
sacrificing	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
offhand	1
fashion.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible,'	1
said	1
I.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
me	1
eagerly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
small	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
a	1
shadow	1
pass	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
I	1
spoke.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
essential,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'It	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
fancy	1
of	1
my	1
wife's,	1
and	1
ladies'	1
fancies,	1
you	1
know,	1
madam,	1
ladies'	1
fancies	1
must	1
be	1
consulted.	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
won't	1
cut	1
your	1
hair?'	1
	1
"'No,	1
sir,	1
I	1
really	1
could	1
not,'	1
I	1
answered	1
firmly.	1
	1
"'Ah,	1
very	1
well;	1
then	1
that	1
quite	1
settles	1
the	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity,	1
because	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
you	1
would	1
really	1
have	1
done	1
very	1
nicely.	1
In	1
that	1
case,	1
Miss	1
Stoper,	1
I	1
had	1
best	1
inspect	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
ladies.'	1
	1
"The	1
manageress	1
had	1
sat	1
all	1
this	1
while	1
busy	1
with	1
her	1
papers	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
us,	1
but	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
me	1
now	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
annoyance	1
upon	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
suspecting	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
handsome	1
commission	1
through	1
my	1
refusal.	1
	1
"'Do	1
you	1
desire	1
your	1
name	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
upon	1
the	1
books?'	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
"'If	1
you	1
please,	1
Miss	1
Stoper.'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
really,	1
it	1
seems	1
rather	1
useless,	1
since	1
you	1
refuse	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
offers	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,'	1
said	1
she	1
sharply.	1
'You	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
us	1
to	1
exert	1
ourselves	1
to	1
find	1
another	1
such	1
opening	1
for	1
you.	1
Good-day	1
to	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.'	1
She	1
struck	1
a	1
gong	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
shown	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
page.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
when	1
I	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
lodgings	1
and	1
found	1
little	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
cupboard,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
bills	1
upon	1
the	1
table,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
myself	1
whether	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
a	1
very	1
foolish	1
thing.	1
After	1
all,	1
if	1
these	1
people	1
had	1
strange	1
fads	1
and	1
expected	1
obedience	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
matters,	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
ready	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
their	1
eccentricity.	1
Very	1
few	1
governesses	1
in	1
England	1
are	1
getting	1
100	1
pounds	1
a	1
year.	1
Besides,	1
what	1
use	1
was	1
my	1
hair	1
to	1
me?	1
Many	1
people	1
are	1
improved	1
by	1
wearing	1
it	1
short	1
and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
number.	1
Next	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
mistake,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
had	1
almost	1
overcome	1
my	1
pride	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
agency	1
and	1
inquire	1
whether	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
still	1
open	1
when	1
I	1
received	1
this	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you:	1

Winchester.	1
"'DEAR	1
MISS	1
HUNTER:--Miss	1
Stoper	1
has	1
very	1
kindly	1
given	1
me	1
your	1
address,	1
and	1
I	1
write	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
reconsidered	1
your	1
decision.	1
My	1
wife	1
is	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
come,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
much	1
attracted	1
by	1
my	1
description	1
of	1
you.	1
We	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
30	1
pounds	1
a	1
quarter,	1
or	1
120	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
any	1
little	1
inconvenience	1
which	1
our	1
fads	1
may	1
cause	1
you.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
exacting,	1
after	1
all.	1
My	1
wife	1
is	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
shade	1
of	1
electric	1
blue	1
and	1
would	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
wear	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
indoors	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
You	1
need	1
not,	1
however,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
purchasing	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
belonging	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
daughter	1
Alice	1
(now	1
in	1
Philadelphia),	1
which	1
would,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
fit	1
you	1
very	1
well.	1
Then,	1
as	1
to	1
sitting	1
here	1
or	1
there,	1
or	1
amusing	1
yourself	1
in	1
any	1
manner	1
indicated,	1
that	1
need	1
cause	1
you	1
no	1
inconvenience.	1
As	1
regards	1
your	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
pity,	1
especially	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
remarking	1
its	1
beauty	1
during	1
our	1
short	1
interview,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
remain	1
firm	1
upon	1
this	1
point,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
increased	1
salary	1
may	1
recompense	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
loss.	1
Your	1
duties,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
concerned,	1
are	1
very	1
light.	1
Now	1
do	1
try	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
dog-cart	1
at	1
Winchester.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
your	1
train.	1

just	1
received,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
accept	1
it.	1
I	1
thought,	1
however,	1
that	1
before	1
taking	1
the	1
final	1
step	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
submit	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
to	1
your	1
consideration."	1
	1
"Well,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
if	1
your	1
mind	1
is	1
made	1
up,	1
that	1
settles	1
the	1
question,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
advise	1
me	1
to	1
refuse?"	1
	1
"I	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
situation	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
mine	1
apply	1
for."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
data.	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
yourself	1
formed	1
some	1
opinion?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
only	1
one	1
possible	1
solution.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
kind,	1
good-natured	1
man.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
lunatic,	1
that	1
he	1
desires	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
matter	1
quiet	1
for	1
fear	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
an	1
asylum,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
humours	1
her	1
fancies	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
outbreak?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
possible	1
solution--in	1
fact,	1
as	1
matters	1
stand,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
probable	1
one.	1
But	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
household	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
lady."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
money,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
the	1
money!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
pay	1
is	1
good--too	1
good.	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
me	1
uneasy.	1
Why	1
should	1
they	1
give	1
you	1
120	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
their	1
pick	1
for	1
40	1
pounds?	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
strong	1
reason	1
behind."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
circumstances	1
you	1
would	1
understand	1
afterwards	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
your	1
help.	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
so	1
much	1
stronger	1
if	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
may	1
carry	1
that	1
feeling	1
away	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
little	1
problem	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
for	1
some	1
months.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
distinctly	1
novel	1
about	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
features.	1
If	1
you	1
should	1
find	1
yourself	1
in	1
doubt	1
or	1
in	1
danger--"	1
	1
"Danger!	1
What	1
danger	1
do	1
you	1
foresee?"	1
	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
gravely.	1
"It	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
danger	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
define	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"But	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
day	1
or	1
night,	1
a	1
telegram	1
would	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
your	1
help."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
enough."	1
She	1
rose	1
briskly	1
from	1
her	1
chair	1
with	1
the	1
anxiety	1
all	1
swept	1
from	1
her	1
face.	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Hampshire	1
quite	1
easy	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
now.	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
at	1
once,	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
poor	1
hair	1
to-night,	1
and	1
start	1
for	1
Winchester	1
to-morrow."	1
With	1
a	1
few	1
grateful	1
words	1
to	1
Holmes	1
she	1
bade	1
us	1
both	1
good-night	1
and	1
bustled	1
off	1
upon	1
her	1
way.	1
	1
"At	1
least,"	1
said	1
I	1
as	1
we	1
heard	1
her	1
quick,	1
firm	1
steps	1
descending	1
the	1
stairs,	1
"she	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
herself."	1
	1
"And	1
she	1
would	1
need	1
to	1
be,"	1
said	1
Holmes	1
gravely.	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
hear	1
from	1
her	1
before	1
many	1
days	1
are	1
past."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
long	1
before	1
my	1
friend's	1
prediction	1
was	1
fulfilled.	1
A	1
fortnight	1
went	1
by,	1
during	1
which	1
I	1
frequently	1
found	1
my	1
thoughts	1
turning	1
in	1
her	1
direction	1
and	1
wondering	1
what	1
strange	1
side-alley	1
of	1
human	1
experience	1
this	1
lonely	1
woman	1
had	1
strayed	1
into.	1
The	1
unusual	1
salary,	1
the	1
curious	1
conditions,	1
the	1
light	1
duties,	1
all	1
pointed	1
to	1
something	1
abnormal,	1
though	1
whether	1
a	1
fad	1
or	1
a	1
plot,	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
a	1
philanthropist	1
or	1
a	1
villain,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
beyond	1
my	1
powers	1
to	1
determine.	1
As	1
to	1
Holmes,	1
I	1
observed	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
frequently	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
on	1
end,	1
with	1
knitted	1
brows	1
and	1
an	1
abstracted	1
air,	1
but	1
he	1
swept	1
the	1
matter	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
his	1
hand	1
when	1
I	1
mentioned	1
it.	1
"Data!	1
data!	1
data!"	1
he	1
cried	1
impatiently.	1
"I	1
can't	1
make	1
bricks	1
without	1
clay."	1
And	1
yet	1
he	1
would	1
always	1
wind	1
up	1
by	1
muttering	1
that	1
no	1
sister	1
of	1
his	1
should	1
ever	1
have	1
accepted	1
such	1
a	1
situation.	1
	1
The	1
telegram	1
which	1
we	1
eventually	1
received	1
came	1
late	1
one	1
night	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
turning	1
in	1
and	1
Holmes	1
was	1
settling	1
down	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
all-night	1
chemical	1
researches	1
which	1
he	1
frequently	1
indulged	1
in,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
leave	1
him	1
stooping	1
over	1
a	1
retort	1
and	1
a	1
test-tube	1
at	1
night	1
and	1
find	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
breakfast	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
yellow	1
envelope,	1
and	1
then,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
message,	1
threw	1
it	1
across	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
up	1
the	1
trains	1
in	1
Bradshaw,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
chemical	1
studies.	1
	1
The	1
summons	1
was	1
a	1
brief	1
and	1
urgent	1
one.	1
	1
"Please	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Black	1
Swan	1
Hotel	1
at	1
Winchester	1
at	1
midday	1
to-morrow,"	1
it	1
said.	1
"Do	1
come!	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
my	1
wit's	1
end.	1
	1
HUNTER."	1
	1
"Will	1
you	1
come	1
with	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Holmes,	1
glancing	1
up.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
wish	1
to."	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
it	1
up,	1
then."	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
train	1
at	1
half-past	1
nine,"	1
said	1
I,	1
glancing	1
over	1
my	1
Bradshaw.	1
"It	1
is	1
due	1
at	1
Winchester	1
at	1
11:30."	1
	1
"That	1
will	1
do	1
very	1
nicely.	1
Then	1
perhaps	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
postpone	1
my	1
analysis	1
of	1
the	1
acetones,	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
our	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
morning."	1
	1
By	1
eleven	1
o'clock	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
well	1
upon	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
English	1
capital.	1
Holmes	1
had	1
been	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
papers	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
down,	1
but	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Hampshire	1
border	1
he	1
threw	1
them	1
down	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
scenery.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
ideal	1
spring	1
day,	1
a	1
light	1
blue	1
sky,	1
flecked	1
with	1
little	1
fleecy	1
white	1
clouds	1
drifting	1
across	1
from	1
west	1
to	1
east.	1
The	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
very	1
brightly,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
exhilarating	1
nip	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
which	1
set	1
an	1
edge	1
to	1
a	1
man's	1
energy.	1
All	1
over	1
the	1
countryside,	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
rolling	1
hills	1
around	1
Aldershot,	1
the	1
little	1
red	1
and	1
grey	1
roofs	1
of	1
the	1
farm-steadings	1
peeped	1
out	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
light	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
foliage.	1
	1
"Are	1
they	1
not	1
fresh	1
and	1
beautiful?"	1
I	1
cried	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
fresh	1
from	1
the	1
fogs	1
of	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
	1
But	1
Holmes	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
gravely.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
Watson,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
curses	1
of	1
a	1
mind	1
with	1
a	1
turn	1
like	1
mine	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
at	1
everything	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
special	1
subject.	1
You	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
scattered	1
houses,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
impressed	1
by	1
their	1
beauty.	1
I	1
look	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
thought	1
which	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
their	1
isolation	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
impunity	1
with	1
which	1
crime	1
may	1
be	1
committed	1
there."	1
	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
I	1
cried.	1
"Who	1
would	1
associate	1
crime	1
with	1
these	1
dear	1
old	1
homesteads?"	1
	1
"They	1
always	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
horror.	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
belief,	1
Watson,	1
founded	1
upon	1
my	1
experience,	1
that	1
the	1
lowest	1
and	1
vilest	1
alleys	1
in	1
London	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
a	1
more	1
dreadful	1
record	1
of	1
sin	1
than	1
does	1
the	1
smiling	1
and	1
beautiful	1
countryside."	1
	1
"You	1
horrify	1
me!"	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
reason	1
is	1
very	1
obvious.	1
The	1
pressure	1
of	1
public	1
opinion	1
can	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
cannot	1
accomplish.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
lane	1
so	1
vile	1
that	1
the	1
scream	1
of	1
a	1
tortured	1
child,	1
or	1
the	1
thud	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard's	1
blow,	1
does	1
not	1
beget	1
sympathy	1
and	1
indignation	1
among	1
the	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
whole	1
machinery	1
of	1
justice	1
is	1
ever	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
complaint	1
can	1
set	1
it	1
going,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
step	1
between	1
the	1
crime	1
and	1
the	1
dock.	1
But	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
lonely	1
houses,	1
each	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
fields,	1
filled	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
with	1
poor	1
ignorant	1
folk	1
who	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
Think	1
of	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
hellish	1
cruelty,	1
the	1
hidden	1
wickedness	1
which	1
may	1
go	1
on,	1
year	1
in,	1
year	1
out,	1
in	1
such	1
places,	1
and	1
none	1
the	1
wiser.	1
Had	1
this	1
lady	1
who	1
appeals	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
help	1
gone	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
Winchester,	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
fear	1
for	1
her.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
five	1
miles	1
of	1
country	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
danger.	1
Still,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
personally	1
threatened."	1
	1
"No.	1
If	1
she	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
Winchester	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
she	1
can	1
get	1
away."	1
	1
"Quite	1
so.	1
She	1
has	1
her	1
freedom."	1
	1
"What	1
CAN	1
be	1
the	1
matter,	1
then?	1
Can	1
you	1
suggest	1
no	1
explanation?"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
devised	1
seven	1
separate	1
explanations,	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
cover	1
the	1
facts	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
them.	1
But	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
correct	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
fresh	1
information	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
no	1
doubt	1
find	1
waiting	1
for	1
us.	1
Well,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
learn	1
all	1
that	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
has	1
to	1
tell."	1
	1
The	1
Black	1
Swan	1
is	1
an	1
inn	1
of	1
repute	1
in	1
the	1
High	1
Street,	1
at	1
no	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
station,	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
found	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
waiting	1
for	1
us.	1
She	1
had	1
engaged	1
a	1
sitting-room,	1
and	1
our	1
lunch	1
awaited	1
us	1
upon	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
delighted	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
come,"	1
she	1
said	1
earnestly.	1
"It	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
kind	1
of	1
you	1
both;	1
but	1
indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do.	1
Your	1
advice	1
will	1
be	1
altogether	1
invaluable	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Pray	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
quick,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
to	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
three.	1
I	1
got	1
his	1
leave	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
town	1
this	1
morning,	1
though	1
he	1
little	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
purpose."	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
have	1
everything	1
in	1
its	1
due	1
order."	1
Holmes	1
thrust	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
legs	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
composed	1
himself	1
to	1
listen.	1
	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
met,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
with	1
no	1
actual	1
ill-treatment	1
from	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
fair	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
that.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
easy	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
about	1
them."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
you	1
not	1
understand?"	1
	1
"Their	1
reasons	1
for	1
their	1
conduct.	1
But	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
occurred.	1
When	1
I	1
came	1
down,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
met	1
me	1
here	1
and	1
drove	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
dog-cart	1
to	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches.	1
It	1
is,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
beautifully	1
situated,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
beautiful	1
in	1
itself,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
large	1
square	1
block	1
of	1
a	1
house,	1
whitewashed,	1
but	1
all	1
stained	1
and	1
streaked	1
with	1
damp	1
and	1
bad	1
weather.	1
There	1
are	1
grounds	1
round	1
it,	1
woods	1
on	1
three	1
sides,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fourth	1
a	1
field	1
which	1
slopes	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
Southampton	1
highroad,	1
which	1
curves	1
past	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
yards	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
This	1
ground	1
in	1
front	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
the	1
woods	1
all	1
round	1
are	1
part	1
of	1
Lord	1
Southerton's	1
preserves.	1
A	1
clump	1
of	1
copper	1
beeches	1
immediately	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
door	1
has	1
given	1
its	1
name	1
to	1
the	1
place.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
driven	1
over	1
by	1
my	1
employer,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
amiable	1
as	1
ever,	1
and	1
was	1
introduced	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
child.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
truth,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
in	1
the	1
conjecture	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
probable	1
in	1
your	1
rooms	1
at	1
Baker	1
Street.	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
is	1
not	1
mad.	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
silent,	1
pale-faced	1
woman,	1
much	1
younger	1
than	1
her	1
husband,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
thirty,	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
while	1
he	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
forty-five.	1
From	1
their	1
conversation	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
married	1
about	1
seven	1
years,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
widower,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
only	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
wife	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
who	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
Philadelphia.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
private	1
that	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
unreasoning	1
aversion	1
to	1
her	1
stepmother.	1
As	1
the	1
daughter	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
than	1
twenty,	1
I	1
can	1
quite	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
position	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
uncomfortable	1
with	1
her	1
father's	1
young	1
wife.	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
colourless	1
in	1
mind	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
feature.	1
She	1
impressed	1
me	1
neither	1
favourably	1
nor	1
the	1
reverse.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
nonentity.	1
It	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
passionately	1
devoted	1
both	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
son.	1
Her	1
light	1
grey	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
continually	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
noting	1
every	1
little	1
want	1
and	1
forestalling	1
it	1
if	1
possible.	1
He	1
was	1
kind	1
to	1
her	1
also	1
in	1
his	1
bluff,	1
boisterous	1
fashion,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
happy	1
couple.	1
And	1
yet	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
secret	1
sorrow,	1
this	1
woman.	1
She	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
deep	1
thought,	1
with	1
the	1
saddest	1
look	1
upon	1
her	1
face.	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
I	1
have	1
surprised	1
her	1
in	1
tears.	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
sometimes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
her	1
child	1
which	1
weighed	1
upon	1
her	1
mind,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
met	1
so	1
utterly	1
spoiled	1
and	1
so	1
ill-natured	1
a	1
little	1
creature.	1
He	1
is	1
small	1
for	1
his	1
age,	1
with	1
a	1
head	1
which	1
is	1
quite	1
disproportionately	1
large.	1
His	1
whole	1
life	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
an	1
alternation	1
between	1
savage	1
fits	1
of	1
passion	1
and	1
gloomy	1
intervals	1
of	1
sulking.	1
Giving	1
pain	1
to	1
any	1
creature	1
weaker	1
than	1
himself	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
one	1
idea	1
of	1
amusement,	1
and	1
he	1
shows	1
quite	1
remarkable	1
talent	1
in	1
planning	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
mice,	1
little	1
birds,	1
and	1
insects.	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
not	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
creature,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
he	1
has	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
my	1
story."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
all	1
details,"	1
remarked	1
my	1
friend,	1
"whether	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
relevant	1
or	1
not."	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
anything	1
of	1
importance.	1
The	1
one	1
unpleasant	1
thing	1
about	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
struck	1
me	1
at	1
once,	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
servants.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
two,	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
wife.	1
Toller,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
name,	1
is	1
a	1
rough,	1
uncouth	1
man,	1
with	1
grizzled	1
hair	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
smell	1
of	1
drink.	1
Twice	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
quite	1
drunk,	1
and	1
yet	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
it.	1
His	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
tall	1
and	1
strong	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sour	1
face,	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
and	1
much	1
less	1
amiable.	1
They	1
are	1
a	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
couple,	1
but	1
fortunately	1
I	1
spend	1
most	1
of	1
my	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
nursery	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
room,	1
which	1
are	1
next	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
building.	1
	1
"For	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches	1
my	1
life	1
was	1
very	1
quiet;	1
on	1
the	1
third,	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
came	1
down	1
just	1
after	1
breakfast	1
and	1
whispered	1
something	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
yes,'	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
me,	1
'we	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
our	1
whims	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
cut	1
your	1
hair.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
detracted	1
in	1
the	1
tiniest	1
iota	1
from	1
your	1
appearance.	1
We	1
shall	1
now	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
electric-blue	1
dress	1
will	1
become	1
you.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
laid	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
your	1
room,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
we	1
should	1
both	1
be	1
extremely	1
obliged.'	1
	1
"The	1
dress	1
which	1
I	1
found	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
shade	1
of	1
blue.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
excellent	1
material,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
beige,	1
but	1
it	1
bore	1
unmistakable	1
signs	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
worn	1
before.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
better	1
fit	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
measured	1
for	1
it.	1
Both	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
expressed	1
a	1
delight	1
at	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
seemed	1
quite	1
exaggerated	1
in	1
its	1
vehemence.	1
They	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
room,	1
stretching	1
along	1
the	1
entire	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
three	1
long	1
windows	1
reaching	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
floor.	1
A	1
chair	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
central	1
window,	1
with	1
its	1
back	1
turned	1
towards	1
it.	1
In	1
this	1
I	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
sit,	1
and	1
then	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
the	1
funniest	1
stories	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
listened	1
to.	1
You	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
comical	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
laughed	1
until	1
I	1
was	1
quite	1
weary.	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle,	1
however,	1
who	1
has	1
evidently	1
no	1
sense	1
of	1
humour,	1
never	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
smiled,	1
but	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
in	1
her	1
lap,	1
and	1
a	1
sad,	1
anxious	1
look	1
upon	1
her	1
face.	1
After	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
so,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
suddenly	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
commence	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
change	1
my	1
dress	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
little	1
Edward	1
in	1
the	1
nursery.	1
	1
"Two	1
days	1
later	1
this	1
same	1
performance	1
was	1
gone	1
through	1
under	1
exactly	1
similar	1
circumstances.	1
Again	1
I	1
changed	1
my	1
dress,	1
again	1
I	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
laughed	1
very	1
heartily	1
at	1
the	1
funny	1
stories	1
of	1
which	1
my	1
employer	1
had	1
an	1
immense	1
répertoire,	1
and	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
inimitably.	1
Then	1
he	1
handed	1
me	1
a	1
yellow-backed	1
novel,	1
and	1
moving	1
my	1
chair	1
a	1
little	1
sideways,	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
shadow	1
might	1
not	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
page,	1
he	1
begged	1
me	1
to	1
read	1
aloud	1
to	1
him.	1
I	1
read	1
for	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
beginning	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
chapter,	1
and	1
then	1
suddenly,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
sentence,	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
cease	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
my	1
dress.	1
	1
"You	1
can	1
easily	1
imagine,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
how	1
curious	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
performance	1
could	1
possibly	1
be.	1
They	1
were	1
always	1
very	1
careful,	1
I	1
observed,	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
face	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
became	1
consumed	1
with	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
behind	1
my	1
back.	1
At	1
first	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
impossible,	1
but	1
I	1
soon	1
devised	1
a	1
means.	1
My	1
hand-mirror	1
had	1
been	1
broken,	1
so	1
a	1
happy	1
thought	1
seized	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
concealed	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
in	1
my	1
handkerchief.	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
occasion,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
laughter,	1
I	1
put	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
management	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
behind	1
me.	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
disappointed.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing.	1
At	1
least	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
impression.	1
At	1
the	1
second	1
glance,	1
however,	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
Southampton	1
Road,	1
a	1
small	1
bearded	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
suit,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
in	1
my	1
direction.	1
The	1
road	1
is	1
an	1
important	1
highway,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
usually	1
people	1
there.	1
This	1
man,	1
however,	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
railings	1
which	1
bordered	1
our	1
field	1
and	1
was	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
up.	1
I	1
lowered	1
my	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
searching	1
gaze.	1
She	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
divined	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
mirror	1
in	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
what	1
was	1
behind	1
me.	1
She	1
rose	1
at	1
once.	1
	1
"'Jephro,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'there	1
is	1
an	1
impertinent	1
fellow	1
upon	1
the	1
road	1
there	1
who	1
stares	1
up	1
at	1
Miss	1
Hunter.'	1
	1
"'No	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
Miss	1
Hunter?'	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"'No,	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
these	1
parts.'	1
	1
"'Dear	1
me!	1
How	1
very	1
impertinent!	1
Kindly	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
motion	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
away.'	1
	1
"'Surely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
notice.'	1
	1
"'No,	1
no,	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
him	1
loitering	1
here	1
always.	1
Kindly	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
wave	1
him	1
away	1
like	1
that.'	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
told,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
drew	1
down	1
the	1
blind.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
week	1
ago,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
sat	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
window,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
worn	1
the	1
blue	1
dress,	1
nor	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
road."	1
	1
"Pray	1
continue,"	1
said	1
Holmes.	1
"Your	1
narrative	1
promises	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
one."	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
rather	1
disconnected,	1
I	1
fear,	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
little	1
relation	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
incidents	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
speak.	1
On	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
took	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
outhouse	1
which	1
stands	1
near	1
the	1
kitchen	1
door.	1
As	1
we	1
approached	1
it	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
sharp	1
rattling	1
of	1
a	1
chain,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
animal	1
moving	1
about.	1
	1
"'Look	1
in	1
here!'	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
showing	1
me	1
a	1
slit	1
between	1
two	1
planks.	1
'Is	1
he	1
not	1
a	1
beauty?'	1
	1
"I	1
looked	1
through	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
two	1
glowing	1
eyes,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
vague	1
figure	1
huddled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
	1
"'Don't	1
be	1
frightened,'	1
said	1
my	1
employer,	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
start	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
given.	1
'It's	1
only	1
Carlo,	1
my	1
mastiff.	1
I	1
call	1
him	1
mine,	1
but	1
really	1
old	1
Toller,	1
my	1
groom,	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
with	1
him.	1
We	1
feed	1
him	1
once	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
then,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
as	1
keen	1
as	1
mustard.	1
Toller	1
lets	1
him	1
loose	1
every	1
night,	1
and	1
God	1
help	1
the	1
trespasser	1
whom	1
he	1
lays	1
his	1
fangs	1
upon.	1
For	1
goodness'	1
sake	1
don't	1
you	1
ever	1
on	1
any	1
pretext	1
set	1
your	1
foot	1
over	1
the	1
threshold	1
at	1
night,	1
for	1
it's	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
your	1
life	1
is	1
worth.'	1
	1
"The	1
warning	1
was	1
no	1
idle	1
one,	1
for	1
two	1
nights	1
later	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
bedroom	1
window	1
about	1
two	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
beautiful	1
moonlight	1
night,	1
and	1
the	1
lawn	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
silvered	1
over	1
and	1
almost	1
as	1
bright	1
as	1
day.	1
I	1
was	1
standing,	1
rapt	1
in	1
the	1
peaceful	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
scene,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
moving	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
copper	1
beeches.	1
As	1
it	1
emerged	1
into	1
the	1
moonshine	1
I	1
saw	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
giant	1
dog,	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
calf,	1
tawny	1
tinted,	1
with	1
hanging	1
jowl,	1
black	1
muzzle,	1
and	1
huge	1
projecting	1
bones.	1
It	1
walked	1
slowly	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
and	1
vanished	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
That	1
dreadful	1
sentinel	1
sent	1
a	1
chill	1
to	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
burglar	1
could	1
have	1
done.	1
	1
"And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
experience	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
had,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
cut	1
off	1
my	1
hair	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
coil	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
my	1
trunk.	1
One	1
evening,	1
after	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
in	1
bed,	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
amuse	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
the	1
furniture	1
of	1
my	1
room	1
and	1
by	1
rearranging	1
my	1
own	1
little	1
things.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
chest	1
of	1
drawers	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
the	1
two	1
upper	1
ones	1
empty	1
and	1
open,	1
the	1
lower	1
one	1
locked.	1
I	1
had	1
filled	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
with	1
my	1
linen,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
still	1
much	1
to	1
pack	1
away	1
I	1
was	1
naturally	1
annoyed	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
drawer.	1
It	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
fastened	1
by	1
a	1
mere	1
oversight,	1
so	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
my	1
bunch	1
of	1
keys	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
key	1
fitted	1
to	1
perfection,	1
and	1
I	1
drew	1
the	1
drawer	1
open.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
guess	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
coil	1
of	1
hair.	1
	1
"I	1
took	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
examined	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
peculiar	1
tint,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thickness.	1
But	1
then	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
obtruded	1
itself	1
upon	1
me.	1
How	1
could	1
my	1
hair	1
have	1
been	1
locked	1
in	1
the	1
drawer?	1
With	1
trembling	1
hands	1
I	1
undid	1
my	1
trunk,	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
contents,	1
and	1
drew	1
from	1
the	1
bottom	1
my	1
own	1
hair.	1
I	1
laid	1
the	1
two	1
tresses	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
identical.	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
extraordinary?	1
Puzzle	1
as	1
I	1
would,	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
I	1
returned	1
the	1
strange	1
hair	1
to	1
the	1
drawer,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
as	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
put	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
by	1
opening	1
a	1
drawer	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
locked.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
naturally	1
observant,	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
remarked,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
soon	1
had	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
my	1
head.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
wing,	1
however,	1
which	1
appeared	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
inhabited	1
at	1
all.	1
A	1
door	1
which	1
faced	1
that	1
which	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
Tollers	1
opened	1
into	1
this	1
suite,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
invariably	1
locked.	1
One	1
day,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
ascended	1
the	1
stair,	1
I	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
coming	1
out	1
through	1
this	1
door,	1
his	1
keys	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
round,	1
jovial	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
was	1
accustomed.	1
His	1
cheeks	1
were	1
red,	1
his	1
brow	1
was	1
all	1
crinkled	1
with	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
stood	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
temples	1
with	1
passion.	1
He	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
hurried	1
past	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
a	1
look.	1
	1
"This	1
aroused	1
my	1
curiosity,	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
grounds	1
with	1
my	1
charge,	1
I	1
strolled	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
There	1
were	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
row,	1
three	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
simply	1
dirty,	1
while	1
the	1
fourth	1
was	1
shuttered	1
up.	1
They	1
were	1
evidently	1
all	1
deserted.	1
As	1
I	1
strolled	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
occasionally,	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
me,	1
looking	1
as	1
merry	1
and	1
jovial	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"'Ah!'	1
said	1
he,	1
'you	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
rude	1
if	1
I	1
passed	1
you	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady.	1
I	1
was	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
business	1
matters.'	1
	1
"I	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
offended.	1
'By	1
the	1
way,'	1
said	1
I,	1
'you	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
quite	1
a	1
suite	1
of	1
spare	1
rooms	1
up	1
there,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
has	1
the	1
shutters	1
up.'	1
	1
"He	1
looked	1
surprised	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
a	1
little	1
startled	1
at	1
my	1
remark.	1
	1
"'Photography	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
hobbies,'	1
said	1
he.	1
'I	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
dark	1
room	1
up	1
there.	1
But,	1
dear	1
me!	1
what	1
an	1
observant	1
young	1
lady	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
upon.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
believed	1
it?	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
ever	1
believed	1
it?'	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
jesting	1
tone,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
jest	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me.	1
I	1
read	1
suspicion	1
there	1
and	1
annoyance,	1
but	1
no	1
jest.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
that	1
I	1
understood	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
about	1
that	1
suite	1
of	1
rooms	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
know,	1
I	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
fire	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
mere	1
curiosity,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
that.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
duty--a	1
feeling	1
that	1
some	1
good	1
might	1
come	1
from	1
my	1
penetrating	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
They	1
talk	1
of	1
woman's	1
instinct;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
woman's	1
instinct	1
which	1
gave	1
me	1
that	1
feeling.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
it	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
keenly	1
on	1
the	1
lookout	1
for	1
any	1
chance	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
forbidden	1
door.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
only	1
yesterday	1
that	1
the	1
chance	1
came.	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
besides	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
both	1
Toller	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
these	1
deserted	1
rooms,	1
and	1
I	1
once	1
saw	1
him	1
carrying	1
a	1
large	1
black	1
linen	1
bag	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
Recently	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
drinking	1
hard,	1
and	1
yesterday	1
evening	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
drunk;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
upstairs	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
the	1
door.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it	1
there.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
were	1
both	1
downstairs,	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
with	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
admirable	1
opportunity.	1
I	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
gently	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
slipped	1
through.	1
	1
"There	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
passage	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me,	1
unpapered	1
and	1
uncarpeted,	1
which	1
turned	1
at	1
a	1
right	1
angle	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end.	1
Round	1
this	1
corner	1
were	1
three	1
doors	1
in	1
a	1
line,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
third	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
open.	1
They	1
each	1
led	1
into	1
an	1
empty	1
room,	1
dusty	1
and	1
cheerless,	1
with	1
two	1
windows	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
so	1
thick	1
with	1
dirt	1
that	1
the	1
evening	1
light	1
glimmered	1
dimly	1
through	1
them.	1
The	1
centre	1
door	1
was	1
closed,	1
and	1
across	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
fastened	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
bars	1
of	1
an	1
iron	1
bed,	1
padlocked	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
to	1
a	1
ring	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
fastened	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
stout	1
cord.	1
The	1
door	1
itself	1
was	1
locked	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
key	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
This	1
barricaded	1
door	1
corresponded	1
clearly	1
with	1
the	1
shuttered	1
window	1
outside,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
the	1
glimmer	1
from	1
beneath	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
darkness.	1
Evidently	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
skylight	1
which	1
let	1
in	1
light	1
from	1
above.	1
As	1
I	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
sinister	1
door	1
and	1
wondering	1
what	1
secret	1
it	1
might	1
veil,	1
I	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
steps	1
within	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
shadow	1
pass	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
against	1
the	1
little	1
slit	1
of	1
dim	1
light	1
which	1
shone	1
out	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
door.	1
A	1
mad,	1
unreasoning	1
terror	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
sight,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
My	1
overstrung	1
nerves	1
failed	1
me	1
suddenly,	1
and	1
I	1
turned	1
and	1
ran--ran	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
dreadful	1
hand	1
were	1
behind	1
me	1
clutching	1
at	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
my	1
dress.	1
I	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
passage,	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
outside.	1
	1
"'So,'	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling,	1
'it	1
was	1
you,	1
then.	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
door	1
open.'	1
	1
"'Oh,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
frightened!'	1
I	1
panted.	1
	1
"'My	1
dear	1
young	1
lady!	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady!'--you	1
cannot	1
think	1
how	1
caressing	1
and	1
soothing	1
his	1
manner	1
was--'and	1
what	1
has	1
frightened	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady?'	1
	1
"But	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
just	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
coaxing.	1
He	1
overdid	1
it.	1
I	1
was	1
keenly	1
on	1
my	1
guard	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
"'I	1
was	1
foolish	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
empty	1
wing,'	1
I	1
answered.	1
'But	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
lonely	1
and	1
eerie	1
in	1
this	1
dim	1
light	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
again.	1
Oh,	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
still	1
in	1
there!'	1
	1
"'Only	1
that?'	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
me	1
keenly.	1
	1
"'Why,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
think?'	1
I	1
asked.	1
	1
"'Why	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
lock	1
this	1
door?'	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know.'	1
	1
"'It	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
people	1
out	1
who	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
there.	1
Do	1
you	1
see?'	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
smiling	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
manner.	1
	1
"'I	1
am	1
sure	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known--'	1
	1
"'Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
know	1
now.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
put	1
your	1
foot	1
over	1
that	1
threshold	1
again'--here	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
smile	1
hardened	1
into	1
a	1
grin	1
of	1
rage,	1
and	1
he	1
glared	1
down	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
demon--'I'll	1
throw	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
mastiff.'	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
so	1
terrified	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
did.	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
rushed	1
past	1
him	1
into	1
my	1
room.	1
I	1
remember	1
nothing	1
until	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
lying	1
on	1
my	1
bed	1
trembling	1
all	1
over.	1
Then	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
there	1
longer	1
without	1
some	1
advice.	1
I	1
was	1
frightened	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
child.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
horrible	1
to	1
me.	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
bring	1
you	1
down	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
Of	1
course	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
my	1
curiosity	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
my	1
fears.	1
My	1
mind	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
up.	1
I	1
would	1
send	1
you	1
a	1
wire.	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
hat	1
and	1
cloak,	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
office,	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
then	1
returned,	1
feeling	1
very	1
much	1
easier.	1
A	1
horrible	1
doubt	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mind	1
as	1
I	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
lest	1
the	1
dog	1
might	1
be	1
loose,	1
but	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
Toller	1
had	1
drunk	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
insensibility	1
that	1
evening,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
household	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
influence	1
with	1
the	1
savage	1
creature,	1
or	1
who	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
free.	1
I	1
slipped	1
in	1
in	1
safety	1
and	1
lay	1
awake	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
my	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
seeing	1
you.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
getting	1
leave	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
Winchester	1
this	1
morning,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
back	1
before	1
three	1
o'clock,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
are	1
going	1
on	1
a	1
visit,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
away	1
all	1
the	1
evening,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
look	1
after	1
the	1
child.	1
Now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
adventures,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
all	1
means,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do."	1
	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
listened	1
spellbound	1
to	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
story.	1
My	1
friend	1
rose	1
now	1
and	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
pockets,	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
profound	1
gravity	1
upon	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Is	1
Toller	1
still	1
drunk?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Yes.	1
I	1
heard	1
his	1
wife	1
tell	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
with	1
him."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
well.	1
And	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
go	1
out	1
to-night?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Is	1
there	1
a	1
cellar	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
strong	1
lock?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
wine-cellar."	1
	1
"You	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
acted	1
all	1
through	1
this	1
matter	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
brave	1
and	1
sensible	1
girl,	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
perform	1
one	1
more	1
feat?	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
ask	1
it	1
of	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
a	1
quite	1
exceptional	1
woman."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
try.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches	1
by	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
my	1
friend	1
and	1
I.	1
The	1
Rucastles	1
will	1
be	1
gone	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
and	1
Toller	1
will,	1
we	1
hope,	1
be	1
incapable.	1
There	1
only	1
remains	1
Mrs.	1
Toller,	1
who	1
might	1
give	1
the	1
alarm.	1
If	1
you	1
could	1
send	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
cellar	1
on	1
some	1
errand,	1
and	1
then	1
turn	1
the	1
key	1
upon	1
her,	1
you	1
would	1
facilitate	1
matters	1
immensely."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
"Excellent!	1
We	1
shall	1
then	1
look	1
thoroughly	1
into	1
the	1
affair.	1
Of	1
course	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
feasible	1
explanation.	1
You	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
there	1
to	1
personate	1
someone,	1
and	1
the	1
real	1
person	1
is	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
this	1
chamber.	1
That	1
is	1
obvious.	1
As	1
to	1
who	1
this	1
prisoner	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
daughter,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
Rucastle,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
right,	1
who	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
America.	1
You	1
were	1
chosen,	1
doubtless,	1
as	1
resembling	1
her	1
in	1
height,	1
figure,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
your	1
hair.	1
Hers	1
had	1
been	1
cut	1
off,	1
very	1
possibly	1
in	1
some	1
illness	1
through	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
passed,	1
and	1
so,	1
of	1
course,	1
yours	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
also.	1
By	1
a	1
curious	1
chance	1
you	1
came	1
upon	1
her	1
tresses.	1
The	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
some	1
friend	1
of	1
hers--possibly	1
her	1
fiancé--and	1
no	1
doubt,	1
as	1
you	1
wore	1
the	1
girl's	1
dress	1
and	1
were	1
so	1
like	1
her,	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
from	1
your	1
laughter,	1
whenever	1
he	1
saw	1
you,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
from	1
your	1
gesture,	1
that	1
Miss	1
Rucastle	1
was	1
perfectly	1
happy,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
no	1
longer	1
desired	1
his	1
attentions.	1
The	1
dog	1
is	1
let	1
loose	1
at	1
night	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
communicate	1
with	1
her.	1
So	1
much	1
is	1
fairly	1
clear.	1
The	1
most	1
serious	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
child."	1
	1
"What	1
on	1
earth	1
has	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?"	1
I	1
ejaculated.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Watson,	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
medical	1
man	1
are	1
continually	1
gaining	1
light	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
tendencies	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
by	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
parents.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
converse	1
is	1
equally	1
valid.	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
gained	1
my	1
first	1
real	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
parents	1
by	1
studying	1
their	1
children.	1
This	1
child's	1
disposition	1
is	1
abnormally	1
cruel,	1
merely	1
for	1
cruelty's	1
sake,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
derives	1
this	1
from	1
his	1
smiling	1
father,	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
suspect,	1
or	1
from	1
his	1
mother,	1
it	1
bodes	1
evil	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
girl	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
power."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
right,	1
Mr.	1
Holmes,"	1
cried	1
our	1
client.	1
"A	1
thousand	1
things	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
make	1
me	1
certain	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
hit	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
let	1
us	1
lose	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
in	1
bringing	1
help	1
to	1
this	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
be	1
circumspect,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
dealing	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
cunning	1
man.	1
We	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
until	1
seven	1
o'clock.	1
At	1
that	1
hour	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
before	1
we	1
solve	1
the	1
mystery."	1
	1
We	1
were	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
our	1
word,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
seven	1
when	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
Copper	1
Beeches,	1
having	1
put	1
up	1
our	1
trap	1
at	1
a	1
wayside	1
public-house.	1
The	1
group	1
of	1
trees,	1
with	1
their	1
dark	1
leaves	1
shining	1
like	1
burnished	1
metal	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
setting	1
sun,	1
were	1
sufficient	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
house	1
even	1
had	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
not	1
been	1
standing	1
smiling	1
on	1
the	1
door-step.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
managed	1
it?"	1
asked	1
Holmes.	1
	1
A	1
loud	1
thudding	1
noise	1
came	1
from	1
somewhere	1
downstairs.	1
"That	1
is	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
in	1
the	1
cellar,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Her	1
husband	1
lies	1
snoring	1
on	1
the	1
kitchen	1
rug.	1
Here	1
are	1
his	1
keys,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
duplicates	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle's."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
done	1
well	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
Holmes	1
with	1
enthusiasm.	1
"Now	1
lead	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
black	1
business."	1
	1
We	1
passed	1
up	1
the	1
stair,	1
unlocked	1
the	1
door,	1
followed	1
on	1
down	1
a	1
passage,	1
and	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
barricade	1
which	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
had	1
described.	1
Holmes	1
cut	1
the	1
cord	1
and	1
removed	1
the	1
transverse	1
bar.	1
Then	1
he	1
tried	1
the	1
various	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
but	1
without	1
success.	1
No	1
sound	1
came	1
from	1
within,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
silence	1
Holmes'	1
face	1
clouded	1
over.	1
	1
"I	1
trust	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
too	1
late,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"I	1
think,	1
Miss	1
Hunter,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
in	1
without	1
you.	1
Now,	1
Watson,	1
put	1
your	1
shoulder	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
we	1
cannot	1
make	1
our	1
way	1
in."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
rickety	1
door	1
and	1
gave	1
at	1
once	1
before	1
our	1
united	1
strength.	1
Together	1
we	1
rushed	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
empty.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
furniture	1
save	1
a	1
little	1
pallet	1
bed,	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
and	1
a	1
basketful	1
of	1
linen.	1
The	1
skylight	1
above	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoner	1
gone.	1
	1
"There	1
has	1
been	1
some	1
villainy	1
here,"	1
said	1
Holmes;	1
"this	1
beauty	1
has	1
guessed	1
Miss	1
Hunter's	1
intentions	1
and	1
has	1
carried	1
his	1
victim	1
off."	1
	1
"But	1
how?"	1
	1
"Through	1
the	1
skylight.	1
We	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
managed	1
it."	1
He	1
swung	1
himself	1
up	1
onto	1
the	1
roof.	1
"Ah,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"here's	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
light	1
ladder	1
against	1
the	1
eaves.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
he	1
did	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Hunter;	1
"the	1
ladder	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
when	1
the	1
Rucastles	1
went	1
away."	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
done	1
it.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
clever	1
and	1
dangerous	1
man.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
he	1
whose	1
step	1
I	1
hear	1
now	1
upon	1
the	1
stair.	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
pistol	1
ready."	1
	1
The	1
words	1
were	1
hardly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
before	1
a	1
man	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
a	1
very	1
fat	1
and	1
burly	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
stick	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
screamed	1
and	1
shrunk	1
against	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
Sherlock	1
Holmes	1
sprang	1
forward	1
and	1
confronted	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
villain!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"where's	1
your	1
daughter?"	1
	1
The	1
fat	1
man	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
round,	1
and	1
then	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
skylight.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
that,"	1
he	1
shrieked,	1
"you	1
thieves!	1
Spies	1
and	1
thieves!	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
you,	1
have	1
I?	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
my	1
power.	1
I'll	1
serve	1
you!"	1
He	1
turned	1
and	1
clattered	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
	1
"He's	1
gone	1
for	1
the	1
dog!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
my	1
revolver,"	1
said	1
I.	1
	1
"Better	1
close	1
the	1
front	1
door,"	1
cried	1
Holmes,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
rushed	1
down	1
the	1
stairs	1
together.	1
We	1
had	1
hardly	1
reached	1
the	1
hall	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
the	1
baying	1
of	1
a	1
hound,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
scream	1
of	1
agony,	1
with	1
a	1
horrible	1
worrying	1
sound	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
dreadful	1
to	1
listen	1
to.	1
An	1
elderly	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face	1
and	1
shaking	1
limbs	1
came	1
staggering	1
out	1
at	1
a	1
side	1
door.	1
	1
"My	1
God!"	1
he	1
cried.	1
"Someone	1
has	1
loosed	1
the	1
dog.	1
It's	1
not	1
been	1
fed	1
for	1
two	1
days.	1
Quick,	1
quick,	1
or	1
it'll	1
be	1
too	1
late!"	1
	1
Holmes	1
and	1
I	1
rushed	1
out	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
Toller	1
hurrying	1
behind	1
us.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
huge	1
famished	1
brute,	1
its	1
black	1
muzzle	1
buried	1
in	1
Rucastle's	1
throat,	1
while	1
he	1
writhed	1
and	1
screamed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
Running	1
up,	1
I	1
blew	1
its	1
brains	1
out,	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
over	1
with	1
its	1
keen	1
white	1
teeth	1
still	1
meeting	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
creases	1
of	1
his	1
neck.	1
With	1
much	1
labour	1
we	1
separated	1
them	1
and	1
carried	1
him,	1
living	1
but	1
horribly	1
mangled,	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
We	1
laid	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
sofa,	1
and	1
having	1
dispatched	1
the	1
sobered	1
Toller	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
news	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
to	1
relieve	1
his	1
pain.	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
assembled	1
round	1
him	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
tall,	1
gaunt	1
woman	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Mrs.	1
Toller!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Hunter.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
miss.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
let	1
me	1
out	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
you.	1
Ah,	1
miss,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
didn't	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
planning,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
pains	1
were	1
wasted."	1
	1
"Ha!"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
looking	1
keenly	1
at	1
her.	1
"It	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
knows	1
more	1
about	1
this	1
matter	1
than	1
anyone	1
else."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
I	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
know."	1
	1
"Then,	1
pray,	1
sit	1
down,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
it	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dark."	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
soon	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"and	1
I'd	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
before	1
now	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
ha'	1
got	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
cellar.	1
If	1
there's	1
police-court	1
business	1
over	1
this,	1
you'll	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
stood	1
your	1
friend,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
Miss	1
Alice's	1
friend	1
too.	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
never	1
happy	1
at	1
home,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
wasn't,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
married	1
again.	1
She	1
was	1
slighted	1
like	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
say	1
in	1
anything,	1
but	1
it	1
never	1
really	1
became	1
bad	1
for	1
her	1
until	1
after	1
she	1
met	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
at	1
a	1
friend's	1
house.	1
As	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
learn,	1
Miss	1
Alice	1
had	1
rights	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
by	1
will,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
quiet	1
and	1
patient,	1
she	1
was,	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
them	1
but	1
just	1
left	1
everything	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle's	1
hands.	1
He	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
safe	1
with	1
her;	1
but	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
a	1
husband	1
coming	1
forward,	1
who	1
would	1
ask	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
would	1
give	1
him,	1
then	1
her	1
father	1
thought	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
on	1
it.	1
He	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
sign	1
a	1
paper,	1
so	1
that	1
whether	1
she	1
married	1
or	1
not,	1
he	1
could	1
use	1
her	1
money.	1
When	1
she	1
wouldn't	1
do	1
it,	1
he	1
kept	1
on	1
worrying	1
her	1
until	1
she	1
got	1
brain-fever,	1
and	1
for	1
six	1
weeks	1
was	1
at	1
death's	1
door.	1
Then	1
she	1
got	1
better	1
at	1
last,	1
all	1
worn	1
to	1
a	1
shadow,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
hair	1
cut	1
off;	1
but	1
that	1
didn't	1
make	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
man	1
could	1
be."	1
	1
"Ah,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"I	1
think	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
makes	1
the	1
matter	1
fairly	1
clear,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
deduce	1
all	1
that	1
remains.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
then,	1
I	1
presume,	1
took	1
to	1
this	1
system	1
of	1
imprisonment?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"And	1
brought	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
down	1
from	1
London	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
disagreeable	1
persistence	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Fowler."	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
it,	1
sir."	1
	1
"But	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
being	1
a	1
persevering	1
man,	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
seaman	1
should	1
be,	1
blockaded	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
having	1
met	1
you	1
succeeded	1
by	1
certain	1
arguments,	1
metallic	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
in	1
convincing	1
you	1
that	1
your	1
interests	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
his."	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Fowler	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
kind-spoken,	1
free-handed	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Toller	1
serenely.	1
	1
"And	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
managed	1
that	1
your	1
good	1
man	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
drink,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
ladder	1
should	1
be	1
ready	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
your	1
master	1
had	1
gone	1
out."	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
it,	1
sir,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
owe	1
you	1
an	1
apology,	1
Mrs.	1
Toller,"	1
said	1
Holmes,	1
"for	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
cleared	1
up	1
everything	1
which	1
puzzled	1
us.	1
And	1
here	1
comes	1
the	1
country	1
surgeon	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Rucastle,	1
so	1
I	1
think,	1
Watson,	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
escort	1
Miss	1
Hunter	1
back	1
to	1
Winchester,	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
our	1
locus	1
standi	1
now	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
questionable	1
one."	1
	1
And	1
thus	1
was	1
solved	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
sinister	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
copper	1
beeches	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door.	1
Mr.	1
Rucastle	1
survived,	1
but	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
broken	1
man,	1
kept	1
alive	1
solely	1
through	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
devoted	1
wife.	1
They	1
still	1
live	1
with	1
their	1
old	1
servants,	1
who	1
probably	1
know	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
Rucastle's	1
past	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
finds	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Fowler	1
and	1
Miss	1
Rucastle	1
were	1
married,	1
by	1
special	1
license,	1
in	1
Southampton	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
their	1
flight,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Mauritius.	1
As	1
to	1
Miss	1
Violet	1
Hunter,	1
my	1
friend	1
Holmes,	1
rather	1
to	1
my	1
disappointment,	1
manifested	1
no	1
further	1
interest	1
in	1
her	1
when	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
problems,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
school	1
at	1
Walsall,	1
where	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
met	1
with	1
considerable	1
success.	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince,	1
so	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
are	1
now	1
just	1
family	1
estates	1
of	1
the	1
Buonapartes.	1
But	1
I	1
warn	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
means	1
war,	1
if	1
you	1
still	1
try	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
infamies	1
and	1
horrors	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
that	1
Antichrist--I	1
really	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
Antichrist--I	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
friend,	1
no	1
longer	1
my	1
'faithful	1
slave,'	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
yourself!	1
But	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
do?	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
have	1
frightened	1
you--sit	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
news."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
July,	1
1805,	1
and	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
the	1
well-known	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer,	1
maid	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
greeted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
high	1
rank	1
and	1
importance,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive	1
at	1
her	1
reception.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
some	1
days.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
suffering	1
from	1
la	1
grippe;	1
grippe	1
being	1
then	1
a	1
new	1
word	1
in	1
St.	1
Petersburg,	1
used	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
elite.	1
	1
All	1
her	1
invitations	1
without	1
exception,	1
written	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
a	1
scarlet-liveried	1
footman	1
that	1
morning,	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do,	1
Count	1
(or	1
Prince),	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
spending	1
an	1
evening	1
with	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
terrible,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
charmed	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
tonight	1
between	1
7	1
and	1
10--Annette	1
Scherer."	1
	1
"Heavens!	1
what	1
a	1
virulent	1
attack!"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
disconcerted	1
by	1
this	1
reception.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
entered,	1
wearing	1
an	1
embroidered	1
court	1
uniform,	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
and	1
had	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
serene	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
flat	1
face.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
that	1
refined	1
French	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
grandfathers	1
not	1
only	1
spoke	1
but	1
thought,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
gentle,	1
patronizing	1
intonation	1
natural	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
society	1
and	1
at	1
court.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
kissed	1
her	1
hand,	1
presenting	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
bald,	1
scented,	1
and	1
shining	1
head,	1
and	1
complacently	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
are.	1
Set	1
your	1
friend's	1
mind	1
at	1
rest,"	1
said	1
he	1
without	1
altering	1
his	1
tone,	1
beneath	1
the	1
politeness	1
and	1
affected	1
sympathy	1
of	1
which	1
indifference	1
and	1
even	1
irony	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
"Can	1
one	1
be	1
well	1
while	1
suffering	1
morally?	1
Can	1
one	1
be	1
calm	1
in	1
times	1
like	1
these	1
if	1
one	1
has	1
any	1
feeling?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"You	1
are	1
staying	1
the	1
whole	1
evening,	1
I	1
hope?"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
English	1
ambassador's?	1
Today	1
is	1
Wednesday.	1
I	1
must	1
put	1
in	1
an	1
appearance	1
there,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"My	1
daughter	1
is	1
coming	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
there."	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
today's	1
fete	1
had	1
been	1
canceled.	1
I	1
confess	1
all	1
these	1
festivities	1
and	1
fireworks	1
are	1
becoming	1
wearisome."	1
	1
"If	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
you	1
wished	1
it,	1
the	1
entertainment	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
off,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
who,	1
like	1
a	1
wound-up	1
clock,	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
said	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
believed.	1
	1
"Don't	1
tease!	1
Well,	1
and	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
decided	1
about	1
Novosiltsev's	1
dispatch?	1
You	1
know	1
everything."	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
one	1
say	1
about	1
it?"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
listless	1
tone.	1
"What	1
has	1
been	1
decided?	1
They	1
have	1
decided	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
burnt	1
his	1
boats,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
burn	1
ours."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
always	1
spoke	1
languidly,	1
like	1
an	1
actor	1
repeating	1
a	1
stale	1
part.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
despite	1
her	1
forty	1
years,	1
overflowed	1
with	1
animation	1
and	1
impulsiveness.	1
To	1
be	1
an	1
enthusiast	1
had	1
become	1
her	1
social	1
vocation	1
and,	1
sometimes	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
it,	1
she	1
became	1
enthusiastic	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
disappoint	1
the	1
expectations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her.	1
The	1
subdued	1
smile	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her	1
faded	1
features,	1
always	1
played	1
round	1
her	1
lips	1
expressed,	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
spoiled	1
child,	1
a	1
continual	1
consciousness	1
of	1
her	1
charming	1
defect,	1
which	1
she	1
neither	1
wished,	1
nor	1
could,	1
nor	1
considered	1
it	1
necessary,	1
to	1
correct.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
on	1
political	1
matters	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
burst	1
out:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
Austria.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
things,	1
but	1
Austria	1
never	1
has	1
wished,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
wish,	1
for	1
war.	1
She	1
is	1
betraying	1
us!	1
Russia	1
alone	1
must	1
save	1
Europe.	1
Our	1
gracious	1
sovereign	1
recognizes	1
his	1
high	1
vocation	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
true	1
to	1
it.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
in!	1
Our	1
good	1
and	1
wonderful	1
sovereign	1
has	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
noblest	1
role	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
virtuous	1
and	1
noble	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
not	1
forsake	1
him.	1
He	1
will	1
fulfill	1
his	1
vocation	1
and	1
crush	1
the	1
hydra	1
of	1
revolution,	1
which	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
terrible	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
murderer	1
and	1
villain!	1
We	1
alone	1
must	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
one....	1
Whom,	1
I	1
ask	1
you,	1
can	1
we	1
rely	1
on?...	1
England	1
with	1
her	1
commercial	1
spirit	1
will	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
loftiness	1
of	1
soul.	1
She	1
has	1
refused	1
to	1
evacuate	1
Malta.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
find,	1
and	1
still	1
seeks,	1
some	1
secret	1
motive	1
in	1
our	1
actions.	1
What	1
answer	1
did	1
Novosiltsev	1
get?	1
None.	1
The	1
English	1
have	1
not	1
understood	1
and	1
cannot	1
understand	1
the	1
self-abnegation	1
of	1
our	1
Emperor	1
who	1
wants	1
nothing	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
only	1
desires	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
mankind.	1
And	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
promised?	1
Nothing!	1
And	1
what	1
little	1
they	1
have	1
promised	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
perform!	1
Prussia	1
has	1
always	1
declared	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
invincible,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Europe	1
is	1
powerless	1
before	1
him....	1
And	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
Hardenburg	1
says,	1
or	1
Haugwitz	1
either.	1
This	1
famous	1
Prussian	1
neutrality	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
trap.	1
I	1
have	1
faith	1
only	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
lofty	1
destiny	1
of	1
our	1
adored	1
monarch.	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
Europe!"	1
	1
She	1
suddenly	1
paused,	1
smiling	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
impetuosity.	1
	1
"I	1
think,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
instead	1
of	1
our	1
dear	1
Wintzingerode	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
captured	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia's	1
consent	1
by	1
assault.	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
eloquent.	1
Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea?"	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
moment.	1
A	1
propos,"	1
she	1
added,	1
becoming	1
calm	1
again,	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
two	1
very	1
interesting	1
men	1
tonight,	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
de	1
Mortemart,	1
who	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Montmorencys	1
through	1
the	1
Rohans,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
French	1
families.	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
genuine	1
emigres,	1
the	1
good	1
ones.	1
And	1
also	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
profound	1
thinker?	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Had	1
you	1
heard?"	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
delighted	1
to	1
meet	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
studied	1
carelessness	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
visit,	1
"is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
wants	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
first	1
secretary	1
at	1
Vienna?	1
The	1
baron	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
is	1
a	1
poor	1
creature."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
wished	1
to	1
obtain	1
this	1
post	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
but	1
others	1
were	1
trying	1
through	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna	1
to	1
secure	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
baron.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
almost	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
anyone	1
else	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
criticize	1
what	1
the	1
Empress	1
desired	1
or	1
was	1
pleased	1
with.	1
	1
"Baron	1
Funke	1
has	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Dowager	1
Empress	1
by	1
her	1
sister,"	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
dry	1
and	1
mournful	1
tone.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
named	1
the	1
Empress,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
face	1
suddenly	1
assumed	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
and	1
sincere	1
devotion	1
and	1
respect	1
mingled	1
with	1
sadness,	1
and	1
this	1
occurred	1
every	1
time	1
she	1
mentioned	1
her	1
illustrious	1
patroness.	1
She	1
added	1
that	1
Her	1
Majesty	1
had	1
deigned	1
to	1
show	1
Baron	1
Funke	1
beaucoup	1
d'estime,	1
and	1
again	1
her	1
face	1
clouded	1
over	1
with	1
sadness.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
looked	1
indifferent.	1
But,	1
with	1
the	1
womanly	1
and	1
courtierlike	1
quickness	1
and	1
tact	1
habitual	1
to	1
her,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
wished	1
both	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him	1
(for	1
daring	1
to	1
speak	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
Empress)	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
console	1
him,	1
so	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Now	1
about	1
your	1
family.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
your	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
everyone	1
has	1
been	1
enraptured	1
by	1
her?	1
They	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
amazingly	1
beautiful."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
to	1
signify	1
his	1
respect	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,"	1
she	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
and	1
smiling	1
amiably	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
political	1
and	1
social	1
topics	1
were	1
ended	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
intimate	1
conversation--"I	1
often	1
think	1
how	1
unfairly	1
sometimes	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
distributed.	1
Why	1
has	1
fate	1
given	1
you	1
two	1
such	1
splendid	1
children?	1
I	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
Anatole,	1
your	1
youngest.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
him,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
admitting	1
of	1
no	1
rejoinder	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
eyebrows.	1
"Two	1
such	1
charming	1
children.	1
And	1
really	1
you	1
appreciate	1
them	1
less	1
than	1
anyone,	1
and	1
so	1
you	1
don't	1
deserve	1
to	1
have	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
she	1
smiled	1
her	1
ecstatic	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
help	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Lavater	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
lack	1
the	1
bump	1
of	1
paternity."	1
	1
"Don't	1
joke;	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
serious	1
talk	1
with	1
you.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
your	1
younger	1
son?	1
Between	1
ourselves"	1
(and	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
its	1
melancholy	1
expression),	1
"he	1
was	1
mentioned	1
at	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
and	1
you	1
were	1
pitied...."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
answered	1
nothing,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
significantly,	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply.	1
He	1
frowned.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
me	1
do?"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
did	1
all	1
a	1
father	1
could	1
for	1
their	1
education,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
both	1
turned	1
out	1
fools.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quiet	1
fool,	1
but	1
Anatole	1
is	1
an	1
active	1
one.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
difference	1
between	1
them."	1
He	1
said	1
this	1
smiling	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
animated	1
than	1
usual,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
round	1
his	1
mouth	1
very	1
clearly	1
revealed	1
something	1
unexpectedly	1
coarse	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
children	1
born	1
to	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
you?	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
father	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
I	1
could	1
reproach	1
you	1
with,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
looking	1
up	1
pensively.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
your	1
faithful	1
slave	1
and	1
to	1
you	1
alone	1
I	1
can	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
cross	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
bear.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
explain	1
it	1
to	1
myself.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
expressed	1
his	1
resignation	1
to	1
cruel	1
fate	1
by	1
a	1
gesture.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
meditated.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
marrying	1
your	1
prodigal	1
son	1
Anatole?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"They	1
say	1
old	1
maids	1
have	1
a	1
mania	1
for	1
matchmaking,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
don't	1
feel	1
that	1
weakness	1
in	1
myself	1
as	1
yet,	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
person	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
Bolkonskaya."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
though,	1
with	1
the	1
quickness	1
of	1
memory	1
and	1
perception	1
befitting	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
indicated	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
considering	1
this	1
information.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,"	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
sad	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
"that	1
Anatole	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
a	1
year?	1
And,"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"what	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
five	1
years,	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this?"	1
Presently	1
he	1
added:	1
"That's	1
what	1
we	1
fathers	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with....	1
Is	1
this	1
princess	1
of	1
yours	1
rich?"	1
	1
"Her	1
father	1
is	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
stingy.	1
He	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
retire	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
under	1
the	1
late	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
'the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia.'	1
He	1
is	1
very	1
clever	1
but	1
eccentric,	1
and	1
a	1
bore.	1
The	1
poor	1
girl	1
is	1
very	1
unhappy.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
brother;	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
married	1
Lise	1
Meinen	1
lately.	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
tonight."	1
	1
"Listen,	1
dear	1
Annette,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince,	1
suddenly	1
taking	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
drawing	1
it	1
downwards.	1
"Arrange	1
that	1
affair	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
your	1
most	1
devoted	1
slave-slafe	1
with	1
an	1
f,	1
as	1
a	1
village	1
elder	1
of	1
mine	1
writes	1
in	1
his	1
reports.	1
She	1
is	1
rich	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
that's	1
all	1
I	1
want."	1
	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
and	1
easy	1
grace	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
swung	1
it	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
armchair,	1
looking	1
in	1
another	1
direction.	1
	1
"Attendez,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
reflecting,	1
"I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise,	1
young	1
Bolkonski's	1
wife,	1
this	1
very	1
evening,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thing	1
can	1
be	1
arranged.	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
family's	1
behalf	1
that	1
I'll	1
start	1
my	1
apprenticeship	1
as	1
old	1
maid."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room	1
was	1
gradually	1
filling.	1
The	1
highest	1
Petersburg	1
society	1
was	1
assembled	1
there:	1
people	1
differing	1
widely	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
character	1
but	1
alike	1
in	1
the	1
social	1
circle	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belonged.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene,	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
entertainment;	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
ball	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
badge	1
as	1
maid	1
of	1
honor.	1
The	1
youthful	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
known	1
as	1
la	1
femme	1
la	1
plus	1
seduisante	1
de	1
Petersbourg,	1
*	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
during	1
the	1
previous	1
winter,	1
and	1
being	1
pregnant	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
large	1
gatherings,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
small	1
receptions.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
Hippolyte,	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
Mortemart,	1
whom	1
he	1
introduced.	1
The	1
Abbe	1
Morio	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
had	1
also	1
come.	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
most	1
fascinating	1
woman	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
To	1
each	1
new	1
arrival	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said,	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
aunt,"	1
or	1
"You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
my	1
aunt?"	1
and	1
very	1
gravely	1
conducted	1
him	1
or	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
lady,	1
wearing	1
large	1
bows	1
of	1
ribbon	1
in	1
her	1
cap,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
sailing	1
in	1
from	1
another	1
room	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
arrive;	1
and	1
slowly	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
visitor	1
to	1
her	1
aunt,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
mentioned	1
each	1
one's	1
name	1
and	1
then	1
left	1
them.	1
	1
Each	1
visitor	1
performed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
greeting	1
this	1
old	1
aunt	1
whom	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
wanted	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
cared	1
about;	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
observed	1
these	1
greetings	1
with	1
mournful	1
and	1
solemn	1
interest	1
and	1
silent	1
approval.	1
The	1
aunt	1
spoke	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
words,	1
about	1
their	1
health	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Her	1
Majesty,	1
"who,	1
thank	1
God,	1
was	1
better	1
today."	1
And	1
each	1
visitor,	1
though	1
politeness	1
prevented	1
his	1
showing	1
impatience,	1
left	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
relief	1
at	1
having	1
performed	1
a	1
vexatious	1
duty	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya	1
had	1
brought	1
some	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
gold-	1
embroidered	1
velvet	1
bag.	1
Her	1
pretty	1
little	1
upper	1
lip,	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
delicate	1
dark	1
down	1
was	1
just	1
perceptible,	1
was	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
her	1
teeth,	1
but	1
it	1
lifted	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
sweetly,	1
and	1
was	1
especially	1
charming	1
when	1
she	1
occasionally	1
drew	1
it	1
down	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
lower	1
lip.	1
As	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
attractive	1
woman,	1
her	1
defect--the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
upper	1
lip	1
and	1
her	1
half-open	1
mouth--seemed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
own	1
special	1
and	1
peculiar	1
form	1
of	1
beauty.	1
Everyone	1
brightened	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
pretty	1
young	1
woman,	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
mother,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health,	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
burden	1
so	1
lightly.	1
Old	1
men	1
and	1
dull	1
dispirited	1
young	1
ones	1
who	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
after	1
being	1
in	1
her	1
company	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
becoming,	1
like	1
her,	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
health.	1
All	1
who	1
talked	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
word	1
saw	1
her	1
bright	1
smile	1
and	1
the	1
constant	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
teeth,	1
thought	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
specially	1
amiable	1
mood	1
that	1
day.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
quick,	1
short,	1
swaying	1
steps,	1
her	1
workbag	1
on	1
her	1
arm,	1
and	1
gaily	1
spreading	1
out	1
her	1
dress	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
near	1
the	1
silver	1
samovar,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
around	1
her.	1
"I	1
have	1
brought	1
my	1
work,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
French,	1
displaying	1
her	1
bag	1
and	1
addressing	1
all	1
present.	1
"Mind,	1
Annette,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
played	1
a	1
wicked	1
trick	1
on	1
me,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
hostess.	1
"You	1
wrote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
small	1
reception,	1
and	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
badly	1
I	1
am	1
dressed."	1
And	1
she	1
spread	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
short-waisted,	1
lace-trimmed,	1
dainty	1
gray	1
dress,	1
girdled	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
ribbon	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
breast.	1
	1
"Soyez	1
tranquille,	1
Lise,	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
prettier	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"You	1
know,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
and	1
still	1
in	1
French,	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
general,	1
"my	1
husband	1
is	1
deserting	1
me?	1
He	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
himself	1
killed.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
this	1
wretched	1
war	1
is	1
for?"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
delightful	1
woman	1
this	1
little	1
princess	1
is!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
arrivals	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
heavily	1
built	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
close-cropped	1
hair,	1
spectacles,	1
the	1
light-colored	1
breeches	1
fashionable	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
ruffle,	1
and	1
a	1
brown	1
dress	1
coat.	1
This	1
stout	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
a	1
well-known	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
time	1
who	1
now	1
lay	1
dying	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
entered	1
either	1
the	1
military	1
or	1
civil	1
service,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
educated,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
first	1
appearance	1
in	1
society.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
greeted	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
nod	1
she	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
lowest	1
hierarchy	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
lowest-grade	1
greeting,	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
something	1
too	1
large	1
and	1
unsuited	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
over	1
her	1
face	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
enter.	1
Though	1
he	1
was	1
certainly	1
rather	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
her	1
anxiety	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
clever	1
though	1
shy,	1
but	1
observant	1
and	1
natural,	1
expression	1
which	1
distinguished	1
him	1
from	1
everyone	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
you,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
visit	1
a	1
poor	1
invalid,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
exchanging	1
an	1
alarmed	1
glance	1
with	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
she	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
Pierre	1
murmured	1
something	1
unintelligible,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
something.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
aunt	1
he	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
pleased	1
smile,	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
alarm	1
was	1
justified,	1
for	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
aunt	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
speech	1
about	1
Her	1
Majesty's	1
health.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
dismay	1
detained	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Morio?	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
man."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
scheme	1
for	1
perpetual	1
peace,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
hardly	1
feasible."	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
so?"	1
rejoined	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
now	1
committed	1
a	1
reverse	1
act	1
of	1
impoliteness.	1
First	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
a	1
lady	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
another	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
away.	1
With	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
and	1
his	1
big	1
feet	1
spread	1
apart,	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
thinking	1
the	1
abbe's	1
plan	1
chimerical.	1
	1
"We	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
And	1
having	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave,	1
she	1
resumed	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
watch,	1
ready	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
any	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
conversation	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
flag.	1
As	1
the	1
foreman	1
of	1
a	1
spinning	1
mill,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
set	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
work,	1
goes	1
round	1
and	1
notices	1
here	1
a	1
spindle	1
that	1
has	1
stopped	1
or	1
there	1
one	1
that	1
creaks	1
or	1
makes	1
more	1
noise	1
than	1
it	1
should,	1
and	1
hastens	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
machine	1
or	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
proper	1
motion,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
moved	1
about	1
her	1
drawing	1
room,	1
approaching	1
now	1
a	1
silent,	1
now	1
a	1
too-noisy	1
group,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
slight	1
rearrangement	1
kept	1
the	1
conversational	1
machine	1
in	1
steady,	1
proper,	1
and	1
regular	1
motion.	1
But	1
amid	1
these	1
cares	1
her	1
anxiety	1
about	1
Pierre	1
was	1
evident.	1
She	1
kept	1
an	1
anxious	1
watch	1
on	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
group	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
there,	1
and	1
again	1
when	1
he	1
passed	1
to	1
another	1
group	1
whose	1
center	1
was	1
the	1
abbe.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
and	1
this	1
reception	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
attended	1
in	1
Russia.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
intellectual	1
lights	1
of	1
Petersburg	1
were	1
gathered	1
there	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
a	1
toyshop,	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look,	1
afraid	1
of	1
missing	1
any	1
clever	1
conversation	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
self-confident	1
and	1
refined	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
very	1
profound.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Morio.	1
Here	1
the	1
conversation	1
seemed	1
interesting	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
own	1
views,	1
as	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
doing.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
swing.	1
The	1
spindles	1
hummed	1
steadily	1
and	1
ceaselessly	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
With	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
aunt,	1
beside	1
whom	1
sat	1
only	1
one	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
who	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
careworn	1
face	1
was	1
rather	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
brilliant	1
society,	1
the	1
whole	1
company	1
had	1
settled	1
into	1
three	1
groups.	1
One,	1
chiefly	1
masculine,	1
had	1
formed	1
round	1
the	1
abbe.	1
Another,	1
of	1
young	1
people,	1
was	1
grouped	1
round	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
Princess	1
Bolkonskaya,	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
rosy,	1
though	1
rather	1
too	1
plump	1
for	1
her	1
age.	1
The	1
third	1
group	1
was	1
gathered	1
round	1
Mortemart	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
was	1
a	1
nice-looking	1
young	1
man	1
with	1
soft	1
features	1
and	1
polished	1
manners,	1
who	1
evidently	1
considered	1
himself	1
a	1
celebrity	1
but	1
out	1
of	1
politeness	1
modestly	1
placed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
was	1
obviously	1
serving	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
her	1
guests.	1
As	1
a	1
clever	1
maitre	1
d'hotel	1
serves	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
specially	1
choice	1
delicacy	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
meat	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen	1
would	1
have	1
cared	1
to	1
eat,	1
so	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
guests,	1
first	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
abbe,	1
as	1
peculiarly	1
choice	1
morsels.	1
The	1
group	1
about	1
Mortemart	1
immediately	1
began	1
discussing	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien.	1
The	1
vicomte	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
perished	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
magnanimity,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
particular	1
reasons	1
for	1
Buonaparte's	1
hatred	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
yes!	1
Do	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
a	1
la	1
Louis	1
XV	1
in	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
sentence:	1
"Contez	1
nous	1
cela,	1
Vicomte."	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
courteously	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
comply.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
arranged	1
a	1
group	1
round	1
him,	1
inviting	1
everyone	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
tale.	1
	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
knew	1
the	1
duc	1
personally,"	1
whispered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guests.	1
"The	1
vicomte	1
is	1
a	1
wonderful	1
raconteur,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
another.	1
"How	1
evidently	1
he	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
a	1
third;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
choicest	1
and	1
most	1
advantageous	1
style,	1
like	1
a	1
well-garnished	1
joint	1
of	1
roast	1
beef	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
dish.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
wished	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
story	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile.	1
	1
"Come	1
over	1
here,	1
Helene,	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
the	1
beautiful	1
young	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
some	1
way	1
off,	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
another	1
group.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled.	1
She	1
rose	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
unchanging	1
smile	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
first	1
entered	1
the	1
room--the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
perfectly	1
beautiful	1
woman.	1
With	1
a	1
slight	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
white	1
dress	1
trimmed	1
with	1
moss	1
and	1
ivy,	1
with	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
white	1
shoulders,	1
glossy	1
hair,	1
and	1
sparkling	1
diamonds,	1
she	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
her,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
smiling	1
on	1
all,	1
as	1
if	1
graciously	1
allowing	1
each	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
admiring	1
her	1
beautiful	1
figure	1
and	1
shapely	1
shoulders,	1
back,	1
and	1
bosom--which	1
in	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
exposed--	1
and	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
a	1
ballroom	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
moved	1
toward	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
Helene	1
was	1
so	1
lovely	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
she	1
not	1
show	1
any	1
trace	1
of	1
coquetry,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
she	1
even	1
appeared	1
shy	1
of	1
her	1
unquestionable	1
and	1
all	1
too	1
victorious	1
beauty.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
wish,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
unable,	1
to	1
diminish	1
its	1
effect.	1
	1
"How	1
lovely!"	1
said	1
everyone	1
who	1
saw	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
vicomte	1
lifted	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
startled	1
by	1
something	1
extraordinary	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
opposite	1
and	1
beamed	1
upon	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
smile.	1
	1
"Madame,	1
I	1
doubt	1
my	1
ability	1
before	1
such	1
an	1
audience,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smilingly	1
inclining	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
rested	1
her	1
bare	1
round	1
arm	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
considered	1
a	1
reply	1
unnecessary.	1
She	1
smilingly	1
waited.	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
being	1
told	1
she	1
sat	1
upright,	1
glancing	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
round	1
arm,	1
altered	1
in	1
shape	1
by	1
its	1
pressure	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
still	1
more	1
beautiful	1
bosom,	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
readjusted	1
a	1
diamond	1
necklace.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
she	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
whenever	1
the	1
story	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
at	1
once	1
adopted	1
just	1
the	1
expression	1
she	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
maid	1
of	1
honor's	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
relapsed	1
into	1
her	1
radiant	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
also	1
left	1
the	1
tea	1
table	1
and	1
followed	1
Helene.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
I'll	1
get	1
my	1
work....	1
Now	1
then,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of?"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
"Fetch	1
me	1
my	1
workbag."	1
	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
general	1
movement	1
as	1
the	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
talking	1
merrily	1
to	1
everyone	1
at	1
once,	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
gaily	1
arranged	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
seat.	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
all	1
right,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
asking	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
begin,	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
her	1
work.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
having	1
brought	1
the	1
workbag,	1
joined	1
the	1
circle	1
and	1
moving	1
a	1
chair	1
close	1
to	1
hers	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
Le	1
charmant	1
Hippolyte	1
was	1
surprising	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
resemblance	1
to	1
his	1
beautiful	1
sister,	1
but	1
yet	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
resemblance	1
he	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
ugly.	1
His	1
features	1
were	1
like	1
his	1
sister's,	1
but	1
while	1
in	1
her	1
case	1
everything	1
was	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
joyous,	1
self-	1
satisfied,	1
youthful,	1
and	1
constant	1
smile	1
of	1
animation,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
wonderful	1
classic	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
figure,	1
his	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
was	1
dulled	1
by	1
imbecility	1
and	1
a	1
constant	1
expression	1
of	1
sullen	1
self-	1
confidence,	1
while	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
thin	1
and	1
weak.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
nose,	1
and	1
mouth	1
all	1
seemed	1
puckered	1
into	1
a	1
vacant,	1
wearied	1
grimace,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
legs	1
always	1
fell	1
into	1
unnatural	1
positions.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ghost	1
story?"	1
said	1
he,	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
the	1
princess	1
and	1
hastily	1
adjusting	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
as	1
if	1
without	1
this	1
instrument	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
begin	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
"Why	1
no,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
astonished	1
narrator,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Because	1
I	1
hate	1
ghost	1
stories,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
self-confidence	1
that	1
his	1
hearers	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
very	1
witty	1
or	1
very	1
stupid.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
dark-green	1
dress	1
coat,	1
knee	1
breeches	1
of	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
cuisse	1
de	1
nymphe	1
effrayee,	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
it,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
silk	1
stockings.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
told	1
his	1
tale	1
very	1
neatly.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
anecdote,	1
then	1
current,	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien	1
had	1
gone	1
secretly	1
to	1
Paris	1
to	1
visit	1
Mademoiselle	1
George;	1
that	1
at	1
her	1
house	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
Bonaparte,	1
who	1
also	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
famous	1
actress'	1
favors,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
presence	1
Napoleon	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fainting	1
fits	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
subject,	1
and	1
was	1
thus	1
at	1
the	1
duc's	1
mercy.	1
The	1
latter	1
spared	1
him,	1
and	1
this	1
magnanimity	1
Bonaparte	1
subsequently	1
repaid	1
by	1
death.	1
	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
very	1
pretty	1
and	1
interesting,	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
rivals	1
suddenly	1
recognized	1
one	1
another;	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
looked	1
agitated.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
	1
"Charming!"	1
whispered	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
sticking	1
the	1
needle	1
into	1
her	1
work	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
fascination	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
appreciated	1
this	1
silent	1
praise	1
and	1
smiling	1
gratefully	1
prepared	1
to	1
continue,	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
watchful	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
so	1
alarmed	1
her,	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
too	1
loudly	1
and	1
vehemently	1
with	1
the	1
abbe,	1
so	1
she	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
rescue.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
abbe	1
about	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
evidently	1
interested	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
simple-minded	1
eagerness,	1
was	1
explaining	1
his	1
pet	1
theory.	1
Both	1
were	1
talking	1
and	1
listening	1
too	1
eagerly	1
and	1
too	1
naturally,	1
which	1
was	1
why	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
disapproved.	1
	1
"The	1
means	1
are...	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people,"	1
the	1
abbe	1
was	1
saying.	1
"It	1
is	1
only	1
necessary	1
for	1
one	1
powerful	1
nation	1
like	1
Russia--barbaric	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be--to	1
place	1
herself	1
disinterestedly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
an	1
alliance	1
having	1
for	1
its	1
object	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
power	1
of	1
Europe,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
save	1
the	1
world!"	1
	1
"But	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
that	1
balance?"	1
Pierre	1
was	1
beginning.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
came	1
up	1
and,	1
looking	1
severely	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
asked	1
the	1
Italian	1
how	1
he	1
stood	1
Russian	1
climate.	1
The	1
Italian's	1
face	1
instantly	1
changed	1
and	1
assumed	1
an	1
offensively	1
affected,	1
sugary	1
expression,	1
evidently	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
conversing	1
with	1
women.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
enchanted	1
by	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
of	1
the	1
wit	1
and	1
culture	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
more	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
feminine	1
society,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
being	1
received,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
climate,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Not	1
letting	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
Pierre	1
escape,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
the	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
under	1
observation,	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
larger	1
circle.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
another	1
visitor	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room:	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
husband.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
firm,	1
clearcut	1
features.	1
Everything	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
weary,	1
bored	1
expression	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
measured	1
step,	1
offered	1
a	1
most	1
striking	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
quiet,	1
little	1
wife.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
knew	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
but	1
had	1
found	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome	1
that	1
it	1
wearied	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
or	1
listen	1
to	1
them.	1
And	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
faces	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
so	1
tedious,	1
none	1
seemed	1
to	1
bore	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
pretty	1
wife.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
that	1
distorted	1
his	1
handsome	1
face,	1
kissed	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
hand,	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
scanned	1
the	1
whole	1
company.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"General	1
Kutuzov,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski,	1
speaking	1
French	1
and	1
stressing	1
the	1
last	1
syllable	1
of	1
the	1
general's	1
name	1
like	1
a	1
Frenchman,	1
"has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
aide-de-camp...."	1
	1
"And	1
Lise,	1
your	1
wife?"	1
	1
"She	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
ashamed	1
to	1
deprive	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
charming	1
wife?"	1
	1
"Andre,"	1
said	1
his	1
wife,	1
addressing	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
coquettish	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
other	1
men,	1
"the	1
vicomte	1
has	1
been	1
telling	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
tale	1
about	1
Mademoiselle	1
George	1
and	1
Buonaparte!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
glad,	1
affectionate	1
eyes,	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
arm.	1
Before	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
frowned	1
again,	1
expressing	1
his	1
annoyance	1
with	1
whoever	1
was	1
touching	1
his	1
arm,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Pierre's	1
beaming	1
face	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
kind	1
and	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
	1
"There	1
now!...	1
So	1
you,	1
too,	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
world?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
here,"	1
replied	1
Pierre.	1
"I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
supper	1
with	1
you.	1
May	1
I?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
continuing	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"No,	1
impossible!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
laughing	1
and	1
pressing	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
men	1
rose	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
pass.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,	1
dear	1
Vicomte,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
holding	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve	1
in	1
a	1
friendly	1
way	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
rising.	1
"This	1
unfortunate	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
ambassador's	1
deprives	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
obliges	1
me	1
to	1
interrupt	1
you.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
enchanting	1
party,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
His	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
chairs,	1
lightly	1
holding	1
up	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dress,	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
shone	1
still	1
more	1
radiantly	1
on	1
her	1
beautiful	1
face.	1
Pierre	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
rapturous,	1
almost	1
frightened,	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
him.	1
	1
"Very	1
lovely,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Very,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
In	1
passing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
seized	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna:	1
"Educate	1
this	1
bear	1
for	1
me!	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
whole	1
month	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
society.	1
Nothing	1
is	1
so	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
clever	1
women."	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
smiled	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
Pierre	1
in	1
hand.	1
She	1
knew	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
connection	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
aunt	1
rose	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
overtook	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
All	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
interest	1
she	1
had	1
assumed	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
kindly	1
and	1
tear-worn	1
face	1
and	1
it	1
now	1
expressed	1
only	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fear.	1
	1
"How	1
about	1
my	1
son	1
Boris,	1
Prince?"	1
said	1
she,	1
hurrying	1
after	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom.	1
"I	1
can't	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
Tell	1
me	1
what	1
news	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
boy."	1
	1
Although	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
listened	1
reluctantly	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
politely	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady,	1
even	1
betraying	1
some	1
impatience,	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
and	1
appealing	1
smile,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
go	1
away.	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
it	1
cost	1
you	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
I	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
Rumyantsev	1
through	1
Prince	1
Golitsyn.	1
That	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
way."	1
	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
a	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
belonging	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
families	1
in	1
Russia,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
poor,	1
and	1
having	1
long	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
society	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
former	1
influential	1
connections.	1
She	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
to	1
procure	1
an	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
Guards	1
for	1
her	1
only	1
son.	1
It	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
solely	1
to	1
meet	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
obtained	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
and	1
had	1
sat	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
story.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
words	1
frightened	1
her,	1
an	1
embittered	1
look	1
clouded	1
her	1
once	1
handsome	1
face,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
then	1
she	1
smiled	1
again	1
and	1
clutched	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arm	1
more	1
tightly.	1
	1
"Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
asked	1
you	1
for	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
will	1
again,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
reminded	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
for	1
God's	1
sake	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
son--and	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
regard	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
benefactor,"	1
she	1
added	1
hurriedly.	1
"No,	1
don't	1
be	1
angry,	1
but	1
promise!	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
Golitsyn	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
refused.	1
Be	1
the	1
kindhearted	1
man	1
you	1
always	1
were,"	1
she	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
smile	1
though	1
tears	1
were	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Papa,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
late,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Helene,	1
turning	1
her	1
beautiful	1
head	1
and	1
looking	1
over	1
her	1
classically	1
molded	1
shoulder	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
waiting	1
by	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
Influence	1
in	1
society,	1
however,	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
which	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
economized	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
last.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
knew	1
this,	1
and	1
having	1
once	1
realized	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
asked	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
begged	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
became	1
chary	1
of	1
using	1
his	1
influence.	1
But	1
in	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya's	1
case	1
he	1
felt,	1
after	1
her	1
second	1
appeal,	1
something	1
like	1
qualms	1
of	1
conscience.	1
She	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
quite	1
true;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
indebted	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
steps	1
in	1
his	1
career.	1
Moreover,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
her	1
manners	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
women--	1
mostly	1
mothers--who,	1
having	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
their	1
minds,	1
will	1
not	1
rest	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
gained	1
their	1
end,	1
and	1
are	1
prepared	1
if	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
insisting	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
after	1
hour,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
scenes.	1
This	1
last	1
consideration	1
moved	1
him.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
familiarity	1
and	1
weariness	1
of	1
tone,	1
"it	1
is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
ask;	1
but	1
to	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
respect	1
your	1
father's	1
memory,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
impossible--your	1
son	1
shall	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards.	1
Here	1
is	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied?"	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
benefactor!	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
expected	1
from	1
you--I	1
knew	1
your	1
kindness!"	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
"Wait--just	1
a	1
word!	1
When	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards..."	1
she	1
faltered.	1
"You	1
are	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich	1
Kutuzov...	1
recommend	1
Boris	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
adjutant!	1
Then	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
rest,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't	1
promise	1
that.	1
You	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
pestered	1
since	1
his	1
appointment	1
as	1
Commander	1
in	1
Chief.	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Moscow	1
ladies	1
have	1
conspired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
all	1
their	1
sons	1
as	1
adjutants."	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
do	1
promise!	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!	1
My	1
dear	1
benefactor..."	1
	1
"Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
beautiful	1
daughter	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
as	1
before,	1
"we	1
shall	1
be	1
late."	1
	1
"Well,	1
au	1
revoir!	1
Good-bye!	1
You	1
hear	1
her?"	1
	1
"Then	1
tomorrow	1
you	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?"	1
	1
"Certainly;	1
but	1
about	1
Kutuzov,	1
I	1
don't	1
promise."	1
	1
"Do	1
promise,	1
do	1
promise,	1
Vasili!"	1
cried	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
coquettish	1
girl,	1
which	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
probably	1
came	1
naturally	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
her	1
careworn	1
face.	1
	1
Apparently	1
she	1
had	1
forgotten	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
habit	1
employed	1
all	1
the	1
old	1
feminine	1
arts.	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
gone	1
her	1
face	1
resumed	1
its	1
former	1
cold,	1
artificial	1
expression.	1
She	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
where	1
the	1
vicomte	1
was	1
still	1
talking,	1
and	1
again	1
pretended	1
to	1
listen,	1
while	1
waiting	1
till	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
to	1
leave.	1
Her	1
task	1
was	1
accomplished.	1

CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
latest	1
comedy,	1
the	1
coronation	1
at	1
Milan?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"and	1
of	1
the	1
comedy	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Genoa	1
and	1
Lucca	1
laying	1
their	1
petitions	1
before	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte,	1
and	1
Monsieur	1
Buonaparte	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
throne	1
and	1
granting	1
the	1
petitions	1
of	1
the	1
nations?	1
Adorable!	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one's	1
head	1
whirl!	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
had	1
gone	1
crazy."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
"'Dieu	1
me	1
la	1
donne,	1
gare	1
a	1
qui	1
la	1
touche!'	1
*	1
They	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fine	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
in	1
Italian:	1
"'Dio	1
mi	1
l'ha	1
dato.	1
Guai	1
a	1
chi	1
la	1
tocchi!'"	1
	1
	1
*	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
who	1
touches	1
it	1
beware!	1
	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
last	1
drop	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
glass	1
run	1
over,"	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
continued.	1
"The	1
sovereigns	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
endure	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
menace	1
to	1
everything."	1
	1
"The	1
sovereigns?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
Russia,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
polite	1
but	1
hopeless:	1
"The	1
sovereigns,	1
madame...	1
What	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
for	1
Louis	1
XVII,	1
for	1
the	1
Queen,	1
or	1
for	1
Madame	1
Elizabeth?	1
Nothing!"	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
animated.	1
"And	1
believe	1
me,	1
they	1
are	1
reaping	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
betrayal	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbon	1
cause.	1
The	1
sovereigns!	1
Why,	1
they	1
are	1
sending	1
ambassadors	1
to	1
compliment	1
the	1
usurper."	1
	1
And	1
sighing	1
disdainfully,	1
he	1
again	1
changed	1
his	1
position.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
vicomte	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
through	1
his	1
lorgnette,	1
suddenly	1
turned	1
completely	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
and	1
having	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
needle	1
began	1
tracing	1
the	1
Conde	1
coat	1
of	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
He	1
explained	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
gravity	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
"Baton	1
de	1
gueules,	1
engrele	1
de	1
gueules	1
d'azur--maison	1
Conde,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
listened,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"If	1
Buonaparte	1
remains	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
France	1
a	1
year	1
longer,"	1
the	1
vicomte	1
continued,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
acquainted	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
does	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
others	1
but	1
follows	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
"things	1
will	1
have	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
By	1
intrigues,	1
violence,	1
exile,	1
and	1
executions,	1
French	1
society--I	1
mean	1
good	1
French	1
society--will	1
have	1
been	1
forever	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
remark,	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
interested	1
him,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
who	1
had	1
him	1
under	1
observation,	1
interrupted:	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
which	1
always	1
accompanied	1
any	1
reference	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family,	1
"has	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
people	1
themselves	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
form	1
of	1
government;	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
once	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
usurper,	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
will	1
certainly	1
throw	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
its	1
rightful	1
king,"	1
she	1
concluded,	1
trying	1
to	1
be	1
amiable	1
to	1
the	1
royalist	1
emigrant.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
doubtful,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Monsieur	1
le	1
Vicomte	1
quite	1
rightly	1
supposes	1
that	1
matters	1
have	1
already	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
regime."	1
	1
"From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
heard,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
blushing	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
"almost	1
all	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
has	1
already	1
gone	1
over	1
to	1
Bonaparte's	1
side."	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
the	1
Buonapartists	1
who	1
say	1
that,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Pierre.	1
"At	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
French	1
public	1
opinion."	1
	1
"Bonaparte	1
has	1
said	1
so,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
was	1
aiming	1
his	1
remarks	1
at	1
him,	1
though	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"'I	1
showed	1
them	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
glory,	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
follow	1
it,'"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
again	1
quoting	1
Napoleon's	1
words.	1
"'I	1
opened	1
my	1
antechambers	1
and	1
they	1
crowded	1
in.'	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
he	1
was	1
justified	1
in	1
saying	1
so."	1
	1
"Not	1
in	1
the	1
least,"	1
replied	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"After	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
partial	1
ceased	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
hero.	1
If	1
to	1
some	1
people,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
"he	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
hero,	1
after	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
the	1
duc	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
martyr	1
more	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
one	1
hero	1
less	1
on	1
earth."	1
	1
Before	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
smile	1
their	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
vicomte's	1
epigram,	1
Pierre	1
again	1
broke	1
into	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
though	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
something	1
inappropriate,	1
she	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
stop	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
Duc	1
d'Enghien,"	1
declared	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
"was	1
a	1
political	1
necessity,	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
showed	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul	1
by	1
not	1
fearing	1
to	1
take	1
on	1
himself	1
the	1
whole	1
responsibility	1
of	1
that	1
deed."	1
	1
"Dieu!	1
Mon	1
Dieu!"	1
muttered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
in	1
a	1
terrified	1
whisper.	1
	1
"What,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre...	1
Do	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
assassination	1
shows	1
greatness	1
of	1
soul?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
smiling	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
work	1
nearer	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"Capital!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
English,	1
and	1
began	1
slapping	1
his	1
knee	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
merely	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
solemnly	1
at	1
his	1
audience	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
and	1
continued.	1
	1
"I	1
say	1
so,"	1
he	1
continued	1
desperately,	1
"because	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
Revolution	1
leaving	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
anarchy,	1
and	1
Napoleon	1
alone	1
understood	1
the	1
Revolution	1
and	1
quelled	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
good,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stop	1
short	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
man's	1
life."	1
	1
"Won't	1
you	1
come	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
table?"	1
suggested	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
without	1
heeding	1
her.	1
	1
"No,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
eager,	1
"Napoleon	1
is	1
great	1
because	1
he	1
rose	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
suppressed	1
its	1
abuses,	1
preserved	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
good	1
in	1
it--equality	1
of	1
citizenship	1
and	1
freedom	1
of	1
speech	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
press--and	1
only	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
did	1
he	1
obtain	1
power."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
if	1
having	1
obtained	1
power,	1
without	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
commit	1
murder	1
he	1
had	1
restored	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
rightful	1
king,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
man,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
	1
"He	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that.	1
The	1
people	1
only	1
gave	1
him	1
power	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rid	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Bourbons	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man.	1
The	1
Revolution	1
was	1
a	1
grand	1
thing!"	1
continued	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
betraying	1
by	1
this	1
desperate	1
and	1
provocative	1
proposition	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
and	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"What?	1
Revolution	1
and	1
regicide	1
a	1
grand	1
thing?...	1
Well,	1
after	1
that...	1
But	1
won't	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
other	1
table?"	1
repeated	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Rousseau's	1
Contrat	1
Social,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
with	1
a	1
tolerant	1
smile.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
of	1
regicide,	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
about	1
ideas."	1
	1
"Yes:	1
ideas	1
of	1
robbery,	1
murder,	1
and	1
regicide,"	1
again	1
interjected	1
an	1
ironical	1
voice.	1
	1
"Those	1
were	1
extremes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
important.	1
What	1
is	1
important	1
are	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
emancipation	1
from	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
equality	1
of	1
citizenship,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
ideas	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
retained	1
in	1
full	1
force."	1
	1
"Liberty	1
and	1
equality,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte	1
contemptuously,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
last	1
deciding	1
seriously	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
this	1
youth	1
how	1
foolish	1
his	1
words	1
were,	1
"high-sounding	1
words	1
which	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
discredited.	1
Who	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality?	1
Even	1
our	1
Saviour	1
preached	1
liberty	1
and	1
equality.	1
Have	1
people	1
since	1
the	1
Revolution	1
become	1
happier?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary.	1
We	1
wanted	1
liberty,	1
but	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
destroyed	1
it."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
kept	1
looking	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile	1
from	1
Pierre	1
to	1
the	1
vicomte	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
vicomte	1
to	1
their	1
hostess.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
outburst	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
despite	1
her	1
social	1
experience,	1
was	1
horror-struck.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
Pierre's	1
sacrilegious	1
words	1
had	1
not	1
exasperated	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
and	1
had	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
him,	1
she	1
rallied	1
her	1
forces	1
and	1
joined	1
the	1
vicomte	1
in	1
a	1
vigorous	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
orator.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how	1
do	1
you	1
explain	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
executing	1
a	1
duc--or	1
even	1
an	1
ordinary	1
man	1
who--is	1
innocent	1
and	1
untried?"	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
"to	1
ask	1
how	1
monsieur	1
explains	1
the	1
18th	1
Brumaire;	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
an	1
imposture?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
swindle,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
man!"	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
prisoners	1
he	1
killed	1
in	1
Africa?	1
That	1
was	1
horrible!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
shrugging	1
her	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"He's	1
a	1
low	1
fellow,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will,"	1
remarked	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whom	1
to	1
answer,	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
smiled.	1
His	1
smile	1
was	1
unlike	1
the	1
half-smile	1
of	1
other	1
people.	1
When	1
he	1
smiled,	1
his	1
grave,	1
even	1
rather	1
gloomy,	1
look	1
was	1
instantaneously	1
replaced	1
by	1
another-	1
-a	1
childlike,	1
kindly,	1
even	1
rather	1
silly	1
look,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
ask	1
forgiveness.	1
	1
The	1
vicomte	1
who	1
was	1
meeting	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
this	1
young	1
Jacobin	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
terrible	1
as	1
his	1
words	1
suggested.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
you	1
all	1
at	1
once?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Besides,	1
in	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
a	1
statesman	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
his	1
acts	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
person,	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
emperor.	1
So	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course!"	1
Pierre	1
chimed	1
in,	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
this	1
reinforcement.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
admit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that	1
Napoleon	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
great	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Arcola,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hospital	1
at	1
Jaffa	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plague-stricken;	1
but...	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
acts	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
justify."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
wished	1
to	1
tone	1
down	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
remarks,	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
started	1
up	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
everyone	1
to	1
attend,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
began:	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
told	1
a	1
charming	1
Moscow	1
story	1
today	1
and	1
must	1
treat	1
you	1
to	1
it.	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
Vicomte--I	1
must	1
tell	1
it	1
in	1
Russian	1
or	1
the	1
point	1
will	1
be	1
lost...."	1
And	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
story	1
in	1
such	1
Russian	1
as	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
would	1
speak	1
after	1
spending	1
about	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
Russia.	1
Everyone	1
waited,	1
so	1
emphatically	1
and	1
eagerly	1
did	1
he	1
demand	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
story.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
in	1
Moscow	1
a	1
lady,	1
une	1
dame,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
stingy.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
two	1
footmen	1
behind	1
her	1
carriage,	1
and	1
very	1
big	1
ones.	1
That	1
was	1
her	1
taste.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
also	1
big.	1
She	1
said..."	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
paused,	1
evidently	1
collecting	1
his	1
ideas	1
with	1
difficulty.	1
	1
"She	1
said...	1
Oh	1
yes!	1
She	1
said,	1
'Girl,'	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
'put	1
on	1
a	1
livery,	1
get	1
up	1
behind	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
while	1
I	1
make	1
some	1
calls.'"	1
	1
Here	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
and	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
long	1
before	1
his	1
audience,	1
which	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
unfavorable	1
to	1
the	1
narrator.	1
Several	1
persons,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
did	1
however	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
went.	1
Suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
wind.	1
The	1
girl	1
lost	1
her	1
hat	1
and	1
her	1
long	1
hair	1
came	1
down...."	1
Here	1
he	1
could	1
contain	1
himself	1
no	1
longer	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
between	1
gasps	1
of	1
laughter:	1
"And	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
knew...."	1
	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
anecdote	1
ended.	1
Though	1
it	1
was	1
unintelligible	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
it,	1
or	1
why	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
Russian,	1
still	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
appreciated	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte's	1
social	1
tact	1
in	1
so	1
agreeably	1
ending	1
Pierre's	1
unpleasant	1
and	1
unamiable	1
outburst.	1
After	1
the	1
anecdote	1
the	1
conversation	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
insignificant	1
small	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
last	1
and	1
next	1
balls,	1
about	1
theatricals,	1
and	1
who	1
would	1
meet	1
whom,	1
and	1
when	1
and	1
where.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Having	1
thanked	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
for	1
her	1
charming	1
soiree,	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
leave.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
ungainly.	1
Stout,	1
about	1
the	1
average	1
height,	1
broad,	1
with	1
huge	1
red	1
hands;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
how	1
to	1
leave	1
one;	1
that	1
is,	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
particularly	1
agreeable	1
before	1
going	1
away.	1
Besides	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
absent-	1
minded.	1
When	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
the	1
general's	1
three-cornered	1
hat,	1
and	1
held	1
it,	1
pulling	1
at	1
the	1
plume,	1
till	1
the	1
general	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
restore	1
it.	1
All	1
his	1
absent-mindedness	1
and	1
inability	1
to	1
enter	1
a	1
room	1
and	1
converse	1
in	1
it	1
was,	1
however,	1
redeemed	1
by	1
his	1
kindly,	1
simple,	1
and	1
modest	1
expression.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
turned	1
toward	1
him	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
Christian	1
mildness	1
that	1
expressed	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
his	1
indiscretion,	1
nodded	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
change	1
your	1
opinions,	1
my	1
dear	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre."	1
	1
When	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
and	1
only	1
bowed,	1
but	1
again	1
everybody	1
saw	1
his	1
smile,	1
which	1
said	1
nothing,	1
unless	1
perhaps,	1
"Opinions	1
are	1
opinions,	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
capital,	1
good-natured	1
fellow	1
I	1
am."	1
And	1
everyone,	1
including	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
felt	1
this.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
and,	1
turning	1
his	1
shoulders	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
cloak,	1
listened	1
indifferently	1
to	1
his	1
wife's	1
chatter	1
with	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
stood	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
pretty,	1
pregnant	1
princess,	1
and	1
stared	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
his	1
eyeglass.	1
	1
"Go	1
in,	1
Annette,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
catch	1
cold,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
"It	1
is	1
settled,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
had	1
already	1
managed	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Lise	1
about	1
the	1
match	1
she	1
contemplated	1
between	1
Anatole	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
sister-in-law.	1
	1
"I	1
rely	1
on	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna,	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
tone.	1
"Write	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
her	1
father	1
looks	1
at	1
the	1
matter.	1
Au	1
revoir!"--	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
hall.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
approached	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and,	1
bending	1
his	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
began	1
to	1
whisper	1
something.	1
	1
Two	1
footmen,	1
the	1
princess'	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
stood	1
holding	1
a	1
shawl	1
and	1
a	1
cloak,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
finish.	1
They	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
sentences	1
which	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
meaningless,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
understanding	1
but	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
The	1
princess	1
as	1
usual	1
spoke	1
smilingly	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
ambassador's,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
"-so	1
dull-.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
delightful	1
evening,	1
has	1
it	1
not?	1
Delightful!"	1
	1
"They	1
say	1
the	1
ball	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
good,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess,	1
drawing	1
up	1
her	1
downy	1
little	1
lip.	1
"All	1
the	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
society	1
will	1
be	1
there."	1
	1
"Not	1
all,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
there;	1
not	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
smiling	1
joyfully;	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
shawl	1
from	1
the	1
footman,	1
whom	1
he	1
even	1
pushed	1
aside,	1
he	1
began	1
wrapping	1
it	1
round	1
the	1
princess.	1
Either	1
from	1
awkwardness	1
or	1
intentionally	1
(no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
which)	1
after	1
the	1
shawl	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
arm	1
around	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
as	1
though	1
embracing	1
her.	1
	1
Still	1
smiling,	1
she	1
gracefully	1
moved	1
away,	1
turning	1
and	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
eyes	1
were	1
closed,	1
so	1
weary	1
and	1
sleepy	1
did	1
he	1
seem.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
ready?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
wife,	1
looking	1
past	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
hurriedly	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cloak,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
latest	1
fashion	1
reached	1
to	1
his	1
very	1
heels,	1
and,	1
stumbling	1
in	1
it,	1
ran	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
following	1
the	1
princess,	1
whom	1
a	1
footman	1
was	1
helping	1
into	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
"Princesse,	1
au	1
revoir,"	1
cried	1
he,	1
stumbling	1
with	1
his	1
tongue	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
with	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
picking	1
up	1
her	1
dress,	1
was	1
taking	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
carriage,	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
adjusting	1
his	1
saber;	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
helping,	1
was	1
in	1
everyone's	1
way.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me,	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Russian	1
in	1
a	1
cold,	1
disagreeable	1
tone	1
to	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
who	1
was	1
blocking	1
his	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
expecting	1
you,	1
Pierre,"	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
voice,	1
but	1
gently	1
and	1
affectionately.	1
	1
The	1
postilion	1
started,	1
the	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
rattled.	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
laughed	1
spasmodically	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
vicomte	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
home.	1
	1
"Well,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
the	1
vicomte,	1
having	1
seated	1
himself	1
beside	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
"your	1
little	1
princess	1
is	1
very	1
nice,	1
very	1
nice	1
indeed,	1
quite	1
French,"	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
fingers.	1
Hippolyte	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
terrible	1
chap	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
innocent	1
airs,"	1
continued	1
the	1
vicomte.	1
"I	1
pity	1
the	1
poor	1
husband,	1
that	1
little	1
officer	1
who	1
gives	1
himself	1
the	1
airs	1
of	1
a	1
monarch."	1
	1
Hippolyte	1
spluttered	1
again,	1
and	1
amid	1
his	1
laughter	1
said,	1
"And	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
ladies	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
French?	1
One	1
has	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them."	1
	1
Pierre	1
reaching	1
the	1
house	1
first	1
went	1
into	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
study	1
like	1
one	1
quite	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
immediately	1
lay	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
(it	1
was	1
Caesar's	1
Commentaries),	1
and	1
resting	1
on	1
his	1
elbow,	1
began	1
reading	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
done	1
to	1
Mlle	1
Scherer?	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
ill	1
now,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
study,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
Pierre	1
turned	1
his	1
whole	1
body,	1
making	1
the	1
sofa	1
creak.	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
eager	1
face	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"That	1
abbe	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
light....	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
is	1
possible	1
but--I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
it...	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
balance	1
of	1
political	1
power...."	1
	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
such	1
abstract	1
conversation.	1
	1
"One	1
can't	1
everywhere	1
say	1
all	1
one	1
thinks,	1
mon	1
cher.	1
Well,	1
have	1
you	1
at	1
last	1
decided	1
on	1
anything?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
guardsman	1
or	1
a	1
diplomatist?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
after	1
a	1
momentary	1
silence.	1
	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
tucked	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
"Really,	1
I	1
don't	1
yet	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
either	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
must	1
decide	1
on	1
something!	1
Your	1
father	1
expects	1
it."	1
	1
Pierre	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
ten	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
abroad	1
with	1
an	1
abbe	1
as	1
tutor,	1
and	1
had	1
remained	1
away	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
twenty.	1
When	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
his	1
father	1
dismissed	1
the	1
abbe	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
"Now	1
go	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
look	1
round,	1
and	1
choose	1
your	1
profession.	1
I	1
will	1
agree	1
to	1
anything.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
money.	1
Write	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
everything."	1
Pierre	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
choosing	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
decided	1
on	1
anything.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
this	1
choice	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
speaking.	1
Pierre	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"But	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
Freemason,"	1
said	1
he,	1
referring	1
to	1
the	1
abbe	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense."	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
"let	1
us	1
talk	1
business.	1
Have	1
you	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
not;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
war	1
now	1
against	1
Napoleon.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
war	1
for	1
freedom	1
I	1
could	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
army;	1
but	1
to	1
help	1
England	1
and	1
Austria	1
against	1
the	1
greatest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
right."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
only	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
childish	1
words.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
finds	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
fact	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
other	1
answer	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
to	1
this	1
naive	1
question.	1
	1
"If	1
no	1
one	1
fought	1
except	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
conviction,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wars,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
ironically.	1
	1
"Very	1
likely	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
splendid,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
about..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war?"	1
asked	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"What	1
for?	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
must.	1
Besides	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going..."	1
He	1
paused.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
because	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
leading	1
here	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
me!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
The	1
rustle	1
of	1
a	1
woman's	1
dress	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shook	1
himself	1
as	1
if	1
waking	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
look	1
it	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
removed	1
his	1
feet	1
from	1
the	1
sofa.	1
The	1
princess	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
had	1
changed	1
her	1
gown	1
for	1
a	1
house	1
dress	1
as	1
fresh	1
and	1
elegant	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
politely	1
placed	1
a	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it,"	1
she	1
began,	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
settling	1
down	1
briskly	1
and	1
fussily	1
in	1
the	1
easy	1
chair,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
Annette	1
never	1
got	1
married?	1
How	1
stupid	1
you	1
men	1
all	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
married	1
her!	1
Excuse	1
me	1
for	1
saying	1
so,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
sense	1
about	1
women.	1
What	1
an	1
argumentative	1
fellow	1
you	1
are,	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre!"	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
arguing	1
with	1
your	1
husband.	1
I	1
can't	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
war,"	1
replied	1
Pierre,	1
addressing	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
so	1
commonly	1
shown	1
by	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
young	1
women.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
started.	1
Evidently	1
Pierre's	1
words	1
touched	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
I	1
tell	1
him!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it;	1
I	1
don't	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
understand	1
why	1
men	1
can't	1
live	1
without	1
wars.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
women	1
don't	1
want	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
don't	1
need	1
it?	1
Now	1
you	1
shall	1
judge	1
between	1
us.	1
I	1
always	1
tell	1
him:	1
Here	1
he	1
is	1
Uncle's	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known,	1
so	1
much	1
appreciated	1
by	1
everyone.	1
The	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
lady	1
asking,	1
'Is	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Prince	1
Andrew?'	1
I	1
did	1
indeed."	1
She	1
laughed.	1
"He	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
received	1
everywhere.	1
He	1
might	1
easily	1
become	1
aide-de-camp	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
graciously.	1
Annette	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
arrange	1
it.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
and,	1
noticing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
conversation,	1
gave	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"When	1
are	1
you	1
starting?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
going,	1
don't!	1
I	1
won't	1
hear	1
it	1
spoken	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
petulantly	1
playful	1
tone	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
Hippolyte	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
plainly	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
of	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
almost	1
a	1
member.	1
"Today	1
when	1
I	1
remembered	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
delightful	1
associations	1
must	1
be	1
broken	1
off...	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
know,	1
Andre..."	1
(she	1
looked	1
significantly	1
at	1
her	1
husband)	1
"I'm	1
afraid,	1
I'm	1
afraid!"	1
she	1
whispered,	1
and	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
her	1
back.	1
	1
Her	1
husband	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
someone	1
besides	1
Pierre	1
and	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
frigid	1
politeness.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,	1
Lise?	1
I	1
don't	1
understand,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"There,	1
what	1
egotists	1
men	1
all	1
are:	1
all,	1
all	1
egotists!	1
Just	1
for	1
a	1
whim	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
goodness	1
only	1
knows	1
why,	1
he	1
leaves	1
me	1
and	1
locks	1
me	1
up	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"With	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
sister,	1
remember,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gently.	1
	1
"Alone	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
without	1
my	1
friends....	1
And	1
he	1
expects	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
afraid."	1
	1
Her	1
tone	1
was	1
now	1
querulous	1
and	1
her	1
lip	1
drawn	1
up,	1
giving	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
joyful,	1
but	1
an	1
animal,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression.	1
She	1
paused	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
it	1
indecorous	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
before	1
Pierre,	1
though	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
lay	1
in	1
that.	1
	1
"I	1
still	1
can't	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
afraid	1
of,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
slowly,	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
blushed,	1
and	1
raised	1
her	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
despair.	1
	1
"No,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
you	1
have	1
changed.	1
Oh,	1
how	1
you	1
have..."	1
	1
"Your	1
doctor	1
tells	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
earlier,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
go."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
suddenly	1
her	1
short	1
downy	1
lip	1
quivered.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose,	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
with	1
naive	1
surprise,	1
now	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
her,	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
rise	1
too,	1
but	1
changed	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
I	1
mind	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
being	1
here?"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
suddenly,	1
her	1
pretty	1
face	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
distorted	1
by	1
a	1
tearful	1
grimace.	1
"I	1
have	1
long	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
why	1
you	1
have	1
changed	1
so	1
to	1
me?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
me.	1
Why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
was	1
all	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said.	1
But	1
that	1
one	1
word	1
expressed	1
an	1
entreaty,	1
a	1
threat,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
conviction	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
regret	1
her	1
words.	1
But	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
hurriedly:	1
	1
"You	1
treat	1
me	1
like	1
an	1
invalid	1
or	1
a	1
child.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
Did	1
you	1
behave	1
like	1
that	1
six	1
months	1
ago?"	1
	1
"Lise,	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
desist,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
still	1
more	1
emphatically.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
agitated	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
rose	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
himself.	1
	1
"Calm	1
yourself,	1
Princess!	1
It	1
seems	1
so	1
to	1
you	1
because...	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
experienced...	1
and	1
so...	1
because...	1
No,	1
excuse	1
me!	1
An	1
outsider	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
here...	1
No,	1
don't	1
distress	1
yourself...	1
Good-	1
bye!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
"No,	1
wait,	1
Pierre!	1
The	1
princess	1
is	1
too	1
kind	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
spending	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
you."	1
	1
"No,	1
he	1
thinks	1
only	1
of	1
himself,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
restraining	1
her	1
angry	1
tears.	1
	1
"Lise!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
dryly,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
pitch	1
which	1
indicates	1
that	1
patience	1
is	1
exhausted.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
angry,	1
squirrel-like	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
princess'	1
pretty	1
face	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
winning	1
and	1
piteous	1
look	1
of	1
fear.	1
Her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
askance	1
at	1
her	1
husband's	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
assumed	1
the	1
timid,	1
deprecating	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
dog	1
when	1
it	1
rapidly	1
but	1
feebly	1
wags	1
its	1
drooping	1
tail.	1
	1
"Mon	1
Dieu,	1
mon	1
Dieu!"	1
she	1
muttered,	1
and	1
lifting	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead.	1
	1
"Good	1
night,	1
Lise,"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
and	1
courteously	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
friends	1
were	1
silent.	1
Neither	1
cared	1
to	1
begin	1
talking.	1
Pierre	1
continually	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rubbed	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
have	1
supper,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
elegant,	1
newly	1
decorated,	1
and	1
luxurious	1
dining	1
room.	1
Everything	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
napkins	1
to	1
the	1
silver,	1
china,	1
and	1
glass	1
bore	1
that	1
imprint	1
of	1
newness	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
households	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
married.	1
Halfway	1
through	1
supper	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
nervous	1
agitation	1
such	1
as	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
began	1
to	1
talk--as	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
long	1
had	1
something	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
suddenly	1
determines	1
to	1
speak	1
out.	1
	1
"Never,	1
never	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
That's	1
my	1
advice:	1
never	1
marry	1
till	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
to	1
yourself	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
you	1
are	1
capable	1
of,	1
and	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
love	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
your	1
choice	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
plainly	1
as	1
she	1
is,	1
or	1
else	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
cruel	1
and	1
irrevocable	1
mistake.	1
Marry	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
old	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
nothing--or	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
noble	1
in	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
lost.	1
It	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
wasted	1
on	1
trifles.	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Yes!	1
Don't	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
with	1
such	1
surprise.	1
If	1
you	1
marry	1
expecting	1
anything	1
from	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
that	1
for	1
you	1
all	1
is	1
ended,	1
all	1
is	1
closed	1
except	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
ranged	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
court	1
lackey	1
and	1
an	1
idiot!...	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
good?..."	1
and	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
which	1
made	1
his	1
face	1
seem	1
different	1
and	1
the	1
good-natured	1
expression	1
still	1
more	1
apparent,	1
and	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
friend	1
in	1
amazement.	1
	1
"My	1
wife,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"is	1
an	1
excellent	1
woman,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
a	1
man's	1
honor	1
is	1
safe;	1
but,	1
O	1
God,	1
what	1
would	1
I	1
not	1
give	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
unmarried!	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
mention	1
this,	1
because	1
I	1
like	1
you."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
ever	1
like	1
that	1
Bolkonski	1
who	1
had	1
lolled	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
easy	1
chairs	1
and	1
with	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
had	1
uttered	1
French	1
phrases	1
between	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
face	1
was	1
now	1
quivering	1
with	1
nervous	1
excitement;	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
life	1
had	1
seemed	1
extinguished,	1
now	1
flashed	1
with	1
brilliant	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
lifeless	1
he	1
seemed	1
at	1
ordinary	1
times,	1
the	1
more	1
impassioned	1
he	1
became	1
in	1
these	1
moments	1
of	1
almost	1
morbid	1
irritation.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
understand	1
why	1
I	1
say	1
this,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
life.	1
You	1
talk	1
of	1
Bonaparte	1
and	1
his	1
career,"	1
said	1
he	1
(though	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
mentioned	1
Bonaparte),	1
"but	1
Bonaparte	1
when	1
he	1
worked	1
went	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
toward	1
his	1
goal.	1
He	1
was	1
free,	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
consider,	1
and	1
he	1
reached	1
it.	1
But	1
tie	1
yourself	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
chained	1
convict,	1
you	1
lose	1
all	1
freedom!	1
And	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
hope	1
and	1
strength	1
merely	1
weighs	1
you	1
down	1
and	1
torments	1
you	1
with	1
regret.	1
Drawing	1
rooms,	1
gossip,	1
balls,	1
vanity,	1
and	1
triviality--these	1
are	1
the	1
enchanted	1
circle	1
I	1
cannot	1
escape	1
from.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
the	1
greatest	1
war	1
there	1
ever	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
and	1
am	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
amiable	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
caustic	1
wit,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"and	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
they	1
listen	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
that	1
stupid	1
set	1
without	1
whom	1
my	1
wife	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
and	1
those	1
women...	1
If	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
those	1
society	1
women	1
are,	1
and	1
women	1
in	1
general!	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
right.	1
Selfish,	1
vain,	1
stupid,	1
trivial	1
in	1
everything--that's	1
what	1
women	1
are	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
true	1
colors!	1
When	1
you	1
meet	1
them	1
in	1
society	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
nothing!	1
No,	1
don't	1
marry,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
don't	1
marry!"	1
concluded	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
funny	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
"that	1
you,	1
you	1
should	1
consider	1
yourself	1
incapable	1
and	1
your	1
life	1
a	1
spoiled	1
life.	1
You	1
have	1
everything	1
before	1
you,	1
everything.	1
And	1
you..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
his	1
sentence,	1
but	1
his	1
tone	1
showed	1
how	1
highly	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
expected	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
he	1
talk	1
like	1
that?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
considered	1
his	1
friend	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
perfection	1
because	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
possessed	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
just	1
the	1
very	1
qualities	1
Pierre	1
lacked,	1
and	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
best	1
described	1
as	1
strength	1
of	1
will.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
always	1
astonished	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
calm	1
manner	1
of	1
treating	1
everybody,	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
memory,	1
his	1
extensive	1
reading	1
(he	1
had	1
read	1
everything,	1
knew	1
everything,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
opinion	1
about	1
everything),	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
at	1
his	1
capacity	1
for	1
work	1
and	1
study.	1
And	1
if	1
Pierre	1
was	1
often	1
struck	1
by	1
Andrew's	1
lack	1
of	1
capacity	1
for	1
philosophical	1
meditation	1
(to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
particularly	1
addicted),	1
he	1
regarded	1
even	1
this	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
defect	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
strength.	1
	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
best,	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
simplest	1
relations	1
of	1
life,	1
praise	1
and	1
commendation	1
are	1
essential,	1
just	1
as	1
grease	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
wheels	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
run	1
smoothly.	1
	1
"My	1
part	1
is	1
played	1
out,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"What's	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
me?	1
Let	1
us	1
talk	1
about	1
you,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
silence,	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
reassuring	1
thoughts.	1
	1
That	1
smile	1
was	1
immediately	1
reflected	1
on	1
Pierre's	1
face.	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
me?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
his	1
face	1
relaxing	1
into	1
a	1
careless,	1
merry	1
smile.	1
"What	1
am	1
I?	1
An	1
illegitimate	1
son!"	1
He	1
suddenly	1
blushed	1
crimson,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
to	1
say	1
this.	1
"Without	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
without	1
means...	1
And	1
it	1
really..."	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what	1
"it	1
really"	1
was.	1
"For	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
free	1
and	1
am	1
all	1
right.	1
Only	1
I	1
haven't	1
the	1
least	1
idea	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
do;	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
consult	1
you	1
seriously."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
kindly	1
at	1
him,	1
yet	1
his	1
glance--friendly	1
and	1
affectionate	1
as	1
it	1
was--expressed	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
you,	1
especially	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
one	1
live	1
man	1
among	1
our	1
whole	1
set.	1
Yes,	1
you're	1
all	1
right!	1
Choose	1
what	1
you	1
will;	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
You'll	1
be	1
all	1
right	1
anywhere.	1
But	1
look	1
here:	1
give	1
up	1
visiting	1
those	1
Kuragins	1
and	1
leading	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
life.	1
It	1
suits	1
you	1
so	1
badly--all	1
this	1
debauchery,	1
dissipation,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
"What	1
would	1
you	1
have,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
"Women,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
women!"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Women	1
who	1
are	1
comme	1
il	1
faut,	1
that's	1
a	1
different	1
matter;	1
but	1
the	1
Kuragins'	1
set	1
of	1
women,	1
'women	1
and	1
wine'	1
I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
staying	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin's	1
and	1
sharing	1
the	1
dissipated	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
the	1
son	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
planning	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
sister.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know?"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
as	1
if	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
thought,	1
"seriously,	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
thinking	1
of	1
it....	1
Leading	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
I	1
can't	1
decide	1
or	1
think	1
properly	1
about	1
anything.	1
One's	1
head	1
aches,	1
and	1
one	1
spends	1
all	1
one's	1
money.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
for	1
tonight,	1
but	1
I	1
won't	1
go."	1
	1
"You	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
word	1
of	1
honor	1
not	1
to	1
go?"	1
	1
"On	1
my	1
honor!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
one	1
o'clock	1
when	1
Pierre	1
left	1
his	1
friend.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cloudless,	1
northern,	1
summer	1
night.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
an	1
open	1
cab	1
intending	1
to	1
drive	1
straight	1
home.	1
But	1
the	1
nearer	1
he	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
night.	1
It	1
was	1
light	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
deserted	1
street	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
more	1
like	1
morning	1
or	1
evening	1
than	1
night.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
that	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin	1
was	1
expecting	1
the	1
usual	1
set	1
for	1
cards	1
that	1
evening,	1
after	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
generally	1
a	1
drinking	1
bout,	1
finishing	1
with	1
visits	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
Pierre	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Kuragin's,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
immediately	1
recalled	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
there.	1
Then,	1
as	1
happens	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
weak	1
character,	1
he	1
desired	1
so	1
passionately	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
that	1
dissipation	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
accustomed	1
to	1
that	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
go.	1
The	1
thought	1
immediately	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
account,	1
because	1
before	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
promised	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
gathering;	1
"besides,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"all	1
such	1
'words	1
of	1
honor'	1
are	1
conventional	1
things	1
with	1
no	1
definite	1
meaning,	1
especially	1
if	1
one	1
considers	1
that	1
by	1
tomorrow	1
one	1
may	1
be	1
dead,	1
or	1
something	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
honor	1
and	1
dishonor	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
same!"	1
Pierre	1
often	1
indulged	1
in	1
reflections	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
nullifying	1
all	1
his	1
decisions	1
and	1
intentions.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Kuragin's.	1
	1
Reaching	1
the	1
large	1
house	1
near	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards'	1
barracks,	1
in	1
which	1
Anatole	1
lived,	1
Pierre	1
entered	1
the	1
lighted	1
porch,	1
ascended	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
anteroom;	1
empty	1
bottles,	1
cloaks,	1
and	1
overshoes	1
were	1
lying	1
about;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
alcohol,	1
and	1
sounds	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
distance.	1
	1
Cards	1
and	1
supper	1
were	1
over,	1
but	1
the	1
visitors	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed.	1
Pierre	1
threw	1
off	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
first	1
room,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
supper.	1
A	1
footman,	1
thinking	1
no	1
one	1
saw	1
him,	1
was	1
drinking	1
on	1
the	1
sly	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
glasses.	1
From	1
the	1
third	1
room	1
came	1
sounds	1
of	1
laughter,	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
familiar	1
voices,	1
the	1
growling	1
of	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
general	1
commotion.	1
Some	1
eight	1
or	1
nine	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
crowding	1
anxiously	1
round	1
an	1
open	1
window.	1
Three	1
others	1
were	1
romping	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
bear,	1
one	1
pulling	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
a	1
hundred	1
on	1
Stevens!"	1
shouted	1
one.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
no	1
holding	1
on!"	1
cried	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
on	1
Dolokhov!"	1
cried	1
a	1
third.	1
"Kuragin,	1
you	1
part	1
our	1
hands."	1
	1
"There,	1
leave	1
Bruin	1
alone;	1
here's	1
a	1
bet	1
on."	1
	1
"At	1
one	1
draught,	1
or	1
he	1
loses!"	1
shouted	1
a	1
fourth.	1
	1
"Jacob,	1
bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
host,	1
a	1
tall,	1
handsome	1
fellow	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
without	1
a	1
coat,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
fine	1
linen	1
shirt	1
unfastened	1
in	1
front.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
you	1
fellows....	1
Here	1
is	1
Petya!	1
Good	1
man!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Another	1
voice,	1
from	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
particularly	1
striking	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
drunken	1
voices	1
by	1
its	1
sober	1
ring,	1
cried	1
from	1
the	1
window:	1
"Come	1
here;	1
part	1
the	1
bets!"	1
This	1
was	1
Dolokhov,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment,	1
a	1
notorious	1
gambler	1
and	1
duelist,	1
who	1
was	1
living	1
with	1
Anatole.	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
merrily.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
What's	1
it	1
all	1
about?"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
drunk	1
yet!	1
A	1
bottle	1
here,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
taking	1
a	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"First	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
must	1
drink!"	1
	1
Pierre	1
drank	1
one	1
glass	1
after	1
another,	1
looking	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
at	1
the	1
tipsy	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
again	1
crowding	1
round	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
their	1
chatter.	1
Anatole	1
kept	1
on	1
refilling	1
Pierre's	1
glass	1
while	1
explaining	1
that	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
betting	1
with	1
Stevens,	1
an	1
English	1
naval	1
officer,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
ledge	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
floor	1
window	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
hanging	1
out.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
you	1
must	1
drink	1
it	1
all,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
the	1
last	1
glass,	1
"or	1
I	1
won't	1
let	1
you	1
go!"	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
won't,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
pushing	1
Anatole	1
aside,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
Englishman's	1
hand	1
and	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bet,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
of	1
medium	1
height,	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
light-blue	1
eyes.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
twenty-five.	1
Like	1
all	1
infantry	1
officers	1
he	1
wore	1
no	1
mustache,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
mouth,	1
the	1
most	1
striking	1
feature	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
was	1
clearly	1
seen.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
that	1
mouth	1
were	1
remarkably	1
finely	1
curved.	1
The	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip	1
formed	1
a	1
sharp	1
wedge	1
and	1
closed	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
firm	1
lower	1
one,	1
and	1
something	1
like	1
two	1
distinct	1
smiles	1
played	1
continually	1
round	1
the	1
two	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
mouth;	1
this,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
resolute,	1
insolent	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
produced	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
his	1
face.	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
small	1
means	1
and	1
no	1
connections.	1
Yet,	1
though	1
Anatole	1
spent	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
rubles,	1
Dolokhov	1
lived	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
placed	1
himself	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
footing	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
them,	1
including	1
Anatole	1
himself,	1
respected	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
did	1
Anatole.	1
Dolokhov	1
could	1
play	1
all	1
games	1
and	1
nearly	1
always	1
won.	1
However	1
much	1
he	1
drank,	1
he	1
never	1
lost	1
his	1
clearheadedness.	1
Both	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
notorious	1
among	1
the	1
rakes	1
and	1
scapegraces	1
of	1
Petersburg.	1
	1
The	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
was	1
brought.	1
The	1
window	1
frame	1
which	1
prevented	1
anyone	1
from	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
outer	1
sill	1
was	1
being	1
forced	1
out	1
by	1
two	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
evidently	1
flurried	1
and	1
intimidated	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
around.	1
	1
Anatole	1
with	1
his	1
swaggering	1
air	1
strode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
smash	1
something.	1
Pushing	1
away	1
the	1
footmen	1
he	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
frame,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
move	1
it.	1
He	1
smashed	1
a	1
pane.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
try,	1
Hercules,"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
Pierre	1
seized	1
the	1
crossbeam,	1
tugged,	1
and	1
wrenched	1
the	1
oak	1
frame	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
crash.	1
	1
"Take	1
it	1
right	1
out,	1
or	1
they'll	1
think	1
I'm	1
holding	1
on,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Is	1
the	1
Englishman	1
bragging?...	1
Eh?	1
Is	1
it	1
all	1
right?"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"First-rate,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
at	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
window,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sky,	1
the	1
dawn	1
merging	1
with	1
the	1
afterglow	1
of	1
sunset,	1
was	1
visible.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
jumped	1
onto	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
"Listen!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
standing	1
there	1
and	1
addressing	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials"--he	1
spoke	1
French	1
that	1
the	1
Englishman	1
might	1
understand	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
it	1
very	1
well--"I	1
bet	1
fifty	1
imperials...	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
hundred?"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
"No,	1
fifty,"	1
replied	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
Fifty	1
imperials...	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
a	1
whole	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum	1
without	1
taking	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
mouth,	1
sitting	1
outside	1
the	1
window	1
on	1
this	1
spot"	1
(he	1
stooped	1
and	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge	1
outside	1
the	1
window)	1
"and	1
without	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
anything.	1
Is	1
that	1
right?"	1
	1
"Quite	1
right,"	1
said	1
the	1
Englishman.	1
	1
Anatole	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
coat	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
him--the	1
Englishman	1
was	1
short--began	1
repeating	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
wager	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
English.	1
	1
"Wait!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
hammering	1
with	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
to	1
attract	1
attention.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
Kuragin.	1
Listen!	1
If	1
anyone	1
else	1
does	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
hundred	1
imperials.	1
Do	1
you	1
understand?"	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
nodded,	1
but	1
gave	1
no	1
indication	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
this	1
challenge	1
or	1
not.	1
Anatole	1
did	1
not	1
release	1
him,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
kept	1
nodding	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
understood,	1
Anatole	1
went	1
on	1
translating	1
Dolokhov's	1
words	1
into	1
English.	1
A	1
thin	1
young	1
lad,	1
an	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
Life	1
Guards,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
that	1
evening,	1
climbed	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
leaned	1
over,	1
and	1
looked	1
down.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
pavement.	1
	1
"Shut	1
up!"	1
cried	1
Dolokhov,	1
pushing	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
lad	1
jumped	1
awkwardly	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
tripping	1
over	1
his	1
spurs.	1
	1
Placing	1
the	1
bottle	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
it	1
easily,	1
Dolokhov	1
climbed	1
carefully	1
and	1
slowly	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
lowered	1
his	1
legs.	1
Pressing	1
against	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
he	1
adjusted	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat,	1
lowered	1
his	1
hands,	1
moved	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bottle.	1
Anatole	1
brought	1
two	1
candles	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
light.	1
Dolokhov's	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
white	1
shirt,	1
and	1
his	1
curly	1
head,	1
were	1
lit	1
up	1
from	1
both	1
sides.	1
Everyone	1
crowded	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
the	1
Englishman	1
in	1
front.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
smiling	1
but	1
silent.	1
One	1
man,	1
older	1
than	1
the	1
others	1
present,	1
suddenly	1
pushed	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
scared	1
and	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
wanted	1
to	1
seize	1
hold	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
shirt.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
this	1
is	1
folly!	1
He'll	1
be	1
killed,"	1
said	1
this	1
more	1
sensible	1
man.	1
	1
Anatole	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
him!	1
You'll	1
startle	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
he'll	1
be	1
killed.	1
Eh?...	1
What	1
then?...	1
Eh?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
turned	1
round	1
and,	1
again	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
arranged	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
seat.	1
	1
"If	1
anyone	1
comes	1
meddling	1
again,"	1
said	1
he,	1
emitting	1
the	1
words	1
separately	1
through	1
his	1
thin	1
compressed	1
lips,	1
"I	1
will	1
throw	1
him	1
down	1
there.	1
Now	1
then!"	1
	1
Saying	1
this	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
round,	1
dropped	1
his	1
hands,	1
took	1
the	1
bottle	1
and	1
lifted	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
balance	1
himself.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
footmen	1
who	1
had	1
stooped	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
some	1
broken	1
glass	1
remained	1
in	1
that	1
position	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
from	1
Dolokhov's	1
back.	1
Anatole	1
stood	1
erect	1
with	1
staring	1
eyes.	1
The	1
Englishman	1
looked	1
on	1
sideways,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
wished	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
affair	1
ran	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pierre	1
hid	1
his	1
face,	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
faint	1
smile	1
forgot	1
to	1
fade	1
though	1
his	1
features	1
now	1
expressed	1
horror	1
and	1
fear.	1
All	1
were	1
still.	1
Pierre	1
took	1
his	1
hands	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Dolokhov	1
still	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position,	1
only	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
thrown	1
further	1
back	1
till	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
touched	1
his	1
shirt	1
collar,	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
holding	1
the	1
bottle	1
was	1
lifted	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
and	1
trembled	1
with	1
the	1
effort.	1
The	1
bottle	1
was	1
emptying	1
perceptibly	1
and	1
rising	1
still	1
higher	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
tilting	1
yet	1
further	1
back.	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
so	1
long?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
elapsed.	1
Suddenly	1
Dolokhov	1
made	1
a	1
backward	1
movement	1
with	1
his	1
spine,	1
and	1
his	1
arm	1
trembled	1
nervously;	1
this	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
cause	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
to	1
slip	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sloping	1
ledge.	1
As	1
he	1
began	1
slipping	1
down,	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arm	1
wavered	1
still	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
strain.	1
One	1
hand	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
clutch	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
but	1
refrained	1
from	1
touching	1
it.	1
Pierre	1
again	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
open	1
them	1
again.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
stir	1
all	1
around.	1
He	1
looked	1
up:	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
window	1
sill,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
but	1
radiant	1
face.	1
	1
"It's	1
empty."	1
	1
He	1
threw	1
the	1
bottle	1
to	1
the	1
Englishman,	1
who	1
caught	1
it	1
neatly.	1
Dolokhov	1
jumped	1
down.	1
He	1
smelt	1
strongly	1
of	1
rum.	1
	1
"Well	1
done!...	1
Fine	1
fellow!...	1
There's	1
a	1
bet	1
for	1
you!...	1
Devil	1
take	1
you!"	1
came	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
The	1
Englishman	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
counting	1
out	1
the	1
money.	1
Dolokhov	1
stood	1
frowning	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
Pierre	1
jumped	1
upon	1
the	1
window	1
sill.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
who	1
wishes	1
to	1
bet	1
with	1
me?	1
I'll	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
thing!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
cried.	1
"Even	1
without	1
a	1
bet,	1
there!	1
Tell	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
bottle.	1
I'll	1
do	1
it....	1
Bring	1
a	1
bottle!"	1
	1
"Let	1
him	1
do	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
next?	1
Have	1
you	1
gone	1
mad?...	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
let	1
you!...	1
Why,	1
you	1
go	1
giddy	1
even	1
on	1
a	1
staircase,"	1
exclaimed	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"I'll	1
drink	1
it!	1
Let's	1
have	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
rum!"	1
shouted	1
Pierre,	1
banging	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
determined	1
and	1
drunken	1
gesture	1
and	1
preparing	1
to	1
climb	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
	1
They	1
seized	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
arms;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
strong	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
touched	1
him	1
was	1
sent	1
flying.	1
	1
"No,	1
you'll	1
never	1
manage	1
him	1
that	1
way,"	1
said	1
Anatole.	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
I'll	1
get	1
round	1
him....	1
Listen!	1
I'll	1
take	1
your	1
bet	1
tomorrow,	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
----'s."	1
	1
"Come	1
on	1
then,"	1
cried	1
Pierre.	1
"Come	1
on!...	1
And	1
we'll	1
take	1
Bruin	1
with	1
us."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
caught	1
the	1
bear,	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
lifted	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
began	1
dancing	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
kept	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
who	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
her	1
only	1
son	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
soiree.	1
The	1
matter	1
was	1
mentioned	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
an	1
exception	1
made,	1
and	1
Boris	1
transferred	1
into	1
the	1
regiment	1
of	1
Semenov	1
Guards	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
cornet.	1
He	1
received,	1
however,	1
no	1
appointment	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
despite	1
all	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
endeavors	1
and	1
entreaties.	1
Soon	1
after	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
Moscow	1
and	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
her	1
rich	1
relations,	1
the	1
Rostovs,	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
stayed	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
darling	1
Bory,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
entered	1
a	1
regiment	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
was	1
being	1
at	1
once	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
Guards	1
as	1
a	1
cornet,	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
from	1
childhood	1
and	1
lived	1
for	1
years	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
already	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
on	1
the	1
tenth	1
of	1
August,	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
in	1
Moscow	1
for	1
his	1
equipment,	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
to	1
Radzivilov.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
St.	1
Natalia's	1
day	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
Rostovs--the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
youngest	1
daughter--both	1
named	1
Nataly.	1
Ever	1
since	1
the	1
morning,	1
carriages	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
continually,	1
bringing	1
visitors	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
big	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
Povarskaya,	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
countess	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
handsome	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
with	1
the	1
visitors	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
congratulate,	1
and	1
who	1
constantly	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
relays.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
about	1
forty-five,	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
Oriental	1
type	1
of	1
face,	1
evidently	1
worn	1
out	1
with	1
childbearing--she	1
had	1
had	1
twelve.	1
A	1
languor	1
of	1
motion	1
and	1
speech,	1
resulting	1
from	1
weakness,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
distinguished	1
air	1
which	1
inspired	1
respect.	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya,	1
who	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
was	1
also	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
helped	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
entertain	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
young	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms,	1
not	1
considering	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
receiving	1
the	1
visitors.	1
The	1
count	1
met	1
the	1
guests	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
off,	1
inviting	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
grateful	1
to	1
you,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
or	1
"ma	1
chere"--he	1
called	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
slightest	1
variation	1
in	1
his	1
tone,	1
"my	1
dear,"	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
above	1
or	1
below	1
him	1
in	1
rank--"I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
our	1
two	1
dear	1
ones	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping.	1
But	1
mind	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
ma	1
chere!	1
On	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
come,	1
mon	1
cher!"	1
These	1
words	1
he	1
repeated	1
to	1
everyone	1
without	1
exception	1
or	1
variation,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
full,	1
cheerful,	1
clean-shaven	1
face,	1
the	1
same	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
quick,	1
repeated	1
bows.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
visitor	1
off	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
toward	1
him	1
or	1
her,	1
and	1
jauntily	1
spreading	1
out	1
his	1
legs	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
enjoys	1
life	1
and	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
live,	1
he	1
swayed	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
with	1
dignity,	1
offered	1
surmises	1
about	1
the	1
weather,	1
or	1
touched	1
on	1
questions	1
of	1
health,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
Russian	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
but	1
self-confident	1
French;	1
then	1
again,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
weary	1
but	1
unflinching	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
duty,	1
he	1
rose	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
visitors	1
off	1
and,	1
stroking	1
his	1
scanty	1
gray	1
hairs	1
over	1
his	1
bald	1
patch,	1
also	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Sometimes	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
anteroom	1
he	1
would	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
conservatory	1
and	1
pantry	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
marble	1
dining	1
hall,	1
where	1
tables	1
were	1
being	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
eighty	1
people;	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
footmen,	1
who	1
were	1
bringing	1
in	1
silver	1
and	1
china,	1
moving	1
tables,	1
and	1
unfolding	1
damask	1
table	1
linen,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
Dmitri	1
Vasilevich,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
and	1
the	1
manager	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
and	1
while	1
looking	1
with	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
enormous	1
table	1
would	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
Dmitri,	1
you'll	1
see	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
all	1
as	1
they	1
should	1
be?	1
That's	1
right!	1
The	1
great	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
serving,	1
that's	1
it."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
complacent	1
sigh	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Lvovna	1
Karagina	1
and	1
her	1
daughter!"	1
announced	1
the	1
countess'	1
gigantic	1
footman	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice,	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
countess	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
from	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
her	1
husband's	1
portrait	1
on	1
it.	1
	1
"I'm	1
quite	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
these	1
callers.	1
However,	1
I'll	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
no	1
more.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
affected.	1
Ask	1
her	1
in,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
sad	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
saying:	1
"Very	1
well,	1
finish	1
me	1
off."	1
	1
A	1
tall,	1
stout,	1
and	1
proud-looking	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
round-faced	1
smiling	1
daughter,	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
their	1
dresses	1
rustling.	1
	1
"Dear	1
Countess,	1
what	1
an	1
age...	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
up,	1
poor	1
child...	1
at	1
the	1
Razumovski's	1
ball...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina...	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
delighted..."	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
animated	1
feminine	1
voices,	1
interrupting	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
chairs.	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
conversations	1
began	1
which	1
last	1
out	1
until,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
pause,	1
the	1
guests	1
rise	1
with	1
a	1
rustle	1
of	1
dresses	1
and	1
say,	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
delighted...	1
Mamma's	1
health...	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
and	1
then,	1
again	1
rustling,	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
put	1
on	1
cloaks	1
or	1
mantles,	1
and	1
drive	1
away.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
chief	1
topic	1
of	1
the	1
day:	1
the	1
illness	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
celebrated	1
beau	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
day,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
about	1
his	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
Pierre,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
behaved	1
so	1
improperly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
reception.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
count,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
bad	1
health,	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
vexation	1
about	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
kill	1
him!"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
that?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
visitor	1
alluded	1
to,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
about	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
distress	1
some	1
fifteen	1
times.	1
	1
"That's	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
a	1
modern	1
education,"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
abroad	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
allowed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
liked,	1
now	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
such	1
terrible	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
expelled	1
by	1
the	1
police."	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
say	1
so!"	1
replied	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"He	1
chose	1
his	1
friends	1
badly,"	1
interposed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son,	1
he,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
Dolokhov	1
have,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
been	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what!	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
it.	1
Dolokhov	1
has	1
been	1
degraded	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
and	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
father	1
managed	1
somehow	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
son's	1
affair	1
hushed	1
up,	1
but	1
even	1
he	1
was	1
ordered	1
out	1
of	1
Petersburg."	1
	1
"But	1
what	1
have	1
they	1
been	1
up	1
to?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"They	1
are	1
regular	1
brigands,	1
especially	1
Dolokhov,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Marya	1
Ivanovna	1
Dolokhova,	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
woman,	1
but	1
there,	1
just	1
fancy!	1
Those	1
three	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
bear	1
somewhere,	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
carriage,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
visit	1
some	1
actresses!	1
The	1
police	1
tried	1
to	1
interfere,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
do?	1
They	1
tied	1
a	1
policeman	1
and	1
the	1
bear	1
back	1
to	1
back	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bear	1
into	1
the	1
Moyka	1
Canal.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bear	1
swimming	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
policeman	1
on	1
his	1
back!"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
nice	1
figure	1
the	1
policeman	1
must	1
have	1
cut,	1
my	1
dear!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
count,	1
dying	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
dreadful!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
laugh	1
at	1
it,	1
Count?"	1
	1
Yet	1
the	1
ladies	1
themselves	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
all	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
rescue	1
the	1
poor	1
man,"	1
continued	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"And	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
son	1
who	1
amuses	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
sensible	1
manner!	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
educated	1
and	1
clever.	1
This	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
foreign	1
education	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
him!	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
receive	1
him,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
money.	1
They	1
wanted	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
quite	1
declined:	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
daughters	1
to	1
consider."	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
so	1
rich?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
girls,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
inattention.	1
"His	1
children	1
are	1
all	1
illegitimate.	1
I	1
think	1
Pierre	1
also	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
The	1
visitor	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
with	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
intervened	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
"The	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is,"	1
said	1
she	1
significantly,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper,	1
"everyone	1
knows	1
Count	1
Cyril's	1
reputation....	1
He	1
has	1
lost	1
count	1
of	1
his	1
children,	1
but	1
this	1
Pierre	1
was	1
his	1
favorite."	1
	1
"How	1
handsome	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
still	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
year	1
ago!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
handsomer	1
man."	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
altered	1
now,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Well,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
the	1
next	1
heir	1
through	1
his	1
wife,	1
but	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
Pierre,	1
looked	1
after	1
his	1
education,	1
and	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
about	1
him;	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
death--and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
die	1
at	1
any	1
moment,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Petersburg-	1
-no	1
one	1
knows	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
immense	1
fortune,	1
Pierre	1
or	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
Forty	1
thousand	1
serfs	1
and	1
millions	1
of	1
rubles!	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
told	1
me	1
himself.	1
Besides,	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
my	1
mother's	1
second	1
cousin.	1
He's	1
also	1
my	1
Bory's	1
godfather,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
attached	1
no	1
importance	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
fact.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Vasili	1
arrived	1
in	1
Moscow	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
hear	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
on	1
some	1
inspection	1
business,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
between	1
ourselves,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
is	1
a	1
pretext.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
hearing	1
how	1
ill	1
he	1
is."	1
	1
"But	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
capital	1
joke,"	1
said	1
the	1
count;	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
elder	1
visitor	1
was	1
not	1
listening,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies.	1
"I	1
can	1
just	1
imagine	1
what	1
a	1
funny	1
figure	1
that	1
policeman	1
cut!"	1
	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
impersonate	1
the	1
policeman,	1
his	1
portly	1
form	1
again	1
shook	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
ringing	1
laugh,	1
the	1
laugh	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
always	1
eats	1
well	1
and,	1
in	1
particular,	1
drinks	1
well.	1
"So	1
do	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
us!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Silence	1
ensued.	1
The	1
countess	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
callers,	1
smiling	1
affably,	1
but	1
not	1
concealing	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
distressed	1
if	1
they	1
now	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave.	1
The	1
visitor's	1
daughter	1
was	1
already	1
smoothing	1
down	1
her	1
dress	1
with	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
mother,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
running	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
chair	1
falling	1
over,	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
thirteen,	1
hiding	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
short	1
muslin	1
frock,	1
darted	1
in	1
and	1
stopped	1
short	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
her	1
flight	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
so	1
far.	1
Behind	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
doorway	1
appeared	1
a	1
student	1
with	1
a	1
crimson	1
coat	1
collar,	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
a	1
plump	1
rosy-faced	1
boy	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
jacket.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
jumped	1
up	1
and,	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
spread	1
his	1
arms	1
wide	1
and	1
threw	1
them	1
round	1
the	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
in.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
she	1
is!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
laughing.	1
"My	1
pet,	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
it	1
is.	1
My	1
dear	1
pet!"	1
	1
"Ma	1
chere,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
everything,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
feigned	1
severity.	1
"You	1
spoil	1
her,	1
Ilya,"	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
many	1
happy	1
returns	1
of	1
your	1
name	1
day,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
child,"	1
she	1
added,	1
addressing	1
the	1
mother.	1
	1
This	1
black-eyed,	1
wide-mouthed	1
girl,	1
not	1
pretty	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
life--with	1
childish	1
bare	1
shoulders	1
which	1
after	1
her	1
run	1
heaved	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
bodice,	1
with	1
black	1
curls	1
tossed	1
backward,	1
thin	1
bare	1
arms,	1
little	1
legs	1
in	1
lace-	1
frilled	1
drawers,	1
and	1
feet	1
in	1
low	1
slippers--was	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
charming	1
age	1
when	1
a	1
girl	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
child,	1
though	1
the	1
child	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
a	1
young	1
woman.	1
Escaping	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
hide	1
her	1
flushed	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla--not	1
paying	1
the	1
least	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
severe	1
remark--and	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
laughed,	1
and	1
in	1
fragmentary	1
sentences	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
about	1
a	1
doll	1
which	1
she	1
produced	1
from	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
frock.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
see?...	1
My	1
doll...	1
Mimi...	1
You	1
see..."	1
was	1
all	1
Natasha	1
managed	1
to	1
utter	1
(to	1
her	1
everything	1
seemed	1
funny).	1
She	1
leaned	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
burst	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prim	1
visitor	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
joining	1
in.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
monstrosity	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
pushing	1
away	1
her	1
daughter	1
with	1
pretended	1
sternness,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
visitor	1
she	1
added:	1
"She	1
is	1
my	1
youngest	1
girl."	1
	1
Natasha,	1
raising	1
her	1
face	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
her	1
mother's	1
mantilla,	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
tears	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
compelled	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
this	1
family	1
scene,	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Natasha,	1
"is	1
Mimi	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
yours?	1
A	1
daughter,	1
I	1
suppose?"	1
	1
Natasha	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
visitor's	1
tone	1
of	1
condescension	1
to	1
childish	1
things.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
seriously.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
younger	1
generation:	1
Boris,	1
the	1
officer,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
son;	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
undergraduate,	1
the	1
count's	1
eldest	1
son;	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
count's	1
fifteen-year-old	1
niece,	1
and	1
little	1
Petya,	1
his	1
youngest	1
boy,	1
had	1
all	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
were	1
obviously	1
trying	1
to	1
restrain	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum	1
the	1
excitement	1
and	1
mirth	1
that	1
shone	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
faces.	1
Evidently	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
rooms,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
dashed	1
out	1
so	1
impetuously,	1
the	1
conversation	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
amusing	1
than	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
talk	1
of	1
society	1
scandals,	1
the	1
weather,	1
and	1
Countess	1
Apraksina.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
suppress	1
their	1
laughter.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
men,	1
the	1
student	1
and	1
the	1
officer,	1
friends	1
from	1
childhood,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
and	1
both	1
handsome	1
fellows,	1
though	1
not	1
alike.	1
Boris	1
was	1
tall	1
and	1
fair,	1
and	1
his	1
calm	1
and	1
handsome	1
face	1
had	1
regular,	1
delicate	1
features.	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
short	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
and	1
an	1
open	1
expression.	1
Dark	1
hairs	1
were	1
already	1
showing	1
on	1
his	1
upper	1
lip,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
face	1
expressed	1
impetuosity	1
and	1
enthusiasm.	1
Nicholas	1
blushed	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
He	1
evidently	1
tried	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
failed.	1
Boris	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
at	1
once	1
found	1
his	1
footing,	1
and	1
related	1
quietly	1
and	1
humorously	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
doll	1
Mimi	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
a	1
young	1
lady,	1
before	1
her	1
nose	1
was	1
broken;	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
aged	1
during	1
the	1
five	1
years	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
her,	1
and	1
how	1
her	1
head	1
had	1
cracked	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
skull.	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
Natasha.	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
younger	1
brother,	1
who	1
was	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
shaking	1
with	1
suppressed	1
laughter,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
herself	1
any	1
longer,	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
her	1
nimble	1
little	1
feet	1
would	1
carry	1
her.	1
Boris	1
did	1
not	1
laugh.	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
out,	1
weren't	1
you,	1
Mamma?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
the	1
carriage?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
mother	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
ready,"	1
she	1
answered,	1
returning	1
his	1
smile.	1
	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Natasha.	1
The	1
plump	1
boy	1
ran	1
after	1
them	1
angrily,	1
as	1
if	1
vexed	1
that	1
their	1
program	1
had	1
been	1
disturbed.	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
The	1
only	1
young	1
people	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
not	1
counting	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor	1
and	1
the	1
countess'	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
(who	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
older	1
than	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
behaved	1
already	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
person),	1
were	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
the	1
niece.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
a	1
slender	1
little	1
brunette	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
veiled	1
by	1
long	1
lashes,	1
thick	1
black	1
plaits	1
coiling	1
twice	1
round	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
tawny	1
tint	1
in	1
her	1
complexion	1
and	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
color	1
of	1
her	1
slender	1
but	1
graceful	1
and	1
muscular	1
arms	1
and	1
neck.	1
By	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
her	1
movements,	1
by	1
the	1
softness	1
and	1
flexibility	1
of	1
her	1
small	1
limbs,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
coyness	1
and	1
reserve	1
of	1
manner,	1
she	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
pretty,	1
half-grown	1
kitten	1
which	1
promises	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
beautiful	1
little	1
cat.	1
She	1
evidently	1
considered	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation	1
by	1
smiling,	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
herself	1
her	1
eyes	1
under	1
their	1
thick	1
long	1
lashes	1
watched	1
her	1
cousin	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
with	1
such	1
passionate	1
girlish	1
adoration	1
that	1
her	1
smile	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant	1
impose	1
upon	1
anyone,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
kitten	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
only	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
with	1
more	1
energy	1
and	1
again	1
play	1
with	1
her	1
cousin	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
too	1
could,	1
like	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah	1
yes,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
addressing	1
the	1
visitor	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
"his	1
friend	1
Boris	1
has	1
become	1
an	1
officer,	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
friendship's	1
sake	1
he	1
is	1
leaving	1
the	1
university	1
and	1
me,	1
his	1
old	1
father,	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
military	1
service,	1
my	1
dear.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
place	1
and	1
everything	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Archives	1
Department!	1
Isn't	1
that	1
friendship?"	1
remarked	1
the	1
count	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
tone.	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
war	1
has	1
been	1
declared,"	1
replied	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"They've	1
been	1
saying	1
so	1
a	1
long	1
while,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
"and	1
they'll	1
say	1
so	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
dear,	1
there's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
"He's	1
joining	1
the	1
hussars."	1
	1
The	1
visitor,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
from	1
friendship,"	1
declared	1
Nicholas,	1
flaring	1
up	1
and	1
turning	1
away	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
shameful	1
aspersion.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
from	1
friendship	1
at	1
all;	1
I	1
simply	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
is	1
my	1
vocation."	1
	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
cousin	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
regarding	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
approbation.	1
	1
"Schubert,	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars,	1
is	1
dining	1
with	1
us	1
today.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
on	1
leave	1
and	1
is	1
taking	1
Nicholas	1
back	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
can't	1
be	1
helped!"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
speaking	1
playfully	1
of	1
a	1
matter	1
that	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
you,	1
Papa,"	1
said	1
his	1
son,	1
"that	1
if	1
you	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
I'll	1
stay.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
use	1
anywhere	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
army;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomat	1
or	1
a	1
government	1
clerk.--I	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
hide	1
what	1
I	1
feel."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
he	1
kept	1
glancing	1
with	1
the	1
flirtatiousness	1
of	1
a	1
handsome	1
youth	1
at	1
Sonya	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
visitor.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
kitten,	1
feasting	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
seemed	1
ready	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
to	1
start	1
her	1
gambols	1
again	1
and	1
display	1
her	1
kittenish	1
nature.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
count.	1
"He	1
always	1
flares	1
up!	1
This	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
turned	1
all	1
their	1
heads;	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
an	1
ensign	1
and	1
became	1
Emperor.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
God	1
grant	1
it,"	1
he	1
added,	1
not	1
noticing	1
his	1
visitor's	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
elders	1
began	1
talking	1
about	1
Bonaparte.	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
turned	1
to	1
young	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
weren't	1
at	1
the	1
Arkharovs'	1
on	1
Thursday.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
dull	1
without	1
you,"	1
said	1
she,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
tender	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
young	1
man,	1
flattered,	1
sat	1
down	1
nearer	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
coquettish	1
smile,	1
and	1
engaged	1
the	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
in	1
a	1
confidential	1
conversation	1
without	1
at	1
all	1
noticing	1
that	1
his	1
involuntary	1
smile	1
had	1
stabbed	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sonya,	1
who	1
blushed	1
and	1
smiled	1
unnaturally.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
talk	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
passionately	1
angry	1
glance,	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
maintain	1
the	1
artificial	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
lips,	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
Nicholas'	1
animation	1
vanished.	1
He	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
pause	1
in	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
distressed	1
face	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
find	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"How	1
plainly	1
all	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
wear	1
their	1
hearts	1
on	1
their	1
sleeves!"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
"Cousinage--	1
dangereux	1
voisinage;"	1
*	1
she	1
added.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Cousinhood	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous	1
neighborhood.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
when	1
the	1
brightness	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
vanished;	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
answering	1
a	1
question	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
put	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
"and	1
how	1
much	1
suffering,	1
how	1
much	1
anxiety	1
one	1
has	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
rejoice	1
in	1
them	1
now!	1
And	1
yet	1
really	1
the	1
anxiety	1
is	1
greater	1
now	1
than	1
the	1
joy.	1
One	1
is	1
always,	1
always	1
anxious!	1
Especially	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
age,	1
so	1
dangerous	1
both	1
for	1
girls	1
and	1
boys."	1
	1
"It	1
all	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
bringing	1
up,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you're	1
quite	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
countess.	1
"Till	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
always,	1
thank	1
God,	1
been	1
my	1
children's	1
friend	1
and	1
had	1
their	1
full	1
confidence,"	1
said	1
she,	1
repeating	1
the	1
mistake	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
parents	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
no	1
secrets	1
from	1
them.	1
"I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
my	1
daughters'	1
first	1
confidante,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
his	1
impulsive	1
nature,	1
does	1
get	1
into	1
mischief	1
(a	1
boy	1
can't	1
help	1
it),	1
he	1
will	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
never	1
be	1
like	1
those	1
Petersburg	1
young	1
men."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
splendid,	1
splendid	1
youngsters,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
always	1
solved	1
questions	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
perplexing	1
by	1
deciding	1
that	1
everything	1
was	1
splendid.	1
"Just	1
fancy:	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
hussar.	1
What's	1
one	1
to	1
do,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
creature	1
your	1
younger	1
girl	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor;	1
"a	1
little	1
volcano!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
a	1
regular	1
volcano,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Takes	1
after	1
me!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
voice	1
she	1
has;	1
though	1
she's	1
my	1
daughter,	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
she'll	1
be	1
a	1
singer,	1
a	1
second	1
Salomoni!	1
We	1
have	1
engaged	1
an	1
Italian	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
lessons."	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
too	1
young?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
harms	1
the	1
voice	1
to	1
train	1
it	1
at	1
that	1
age."	1
	1
"Oh	1
no,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
too	1
young!"	1
replied	1
the	1
count.	1
"Why,	1
our	1
mothers	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
at	1
twelve	1
or	1
thirteen."	1
	1
"And	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Boris	1
already.	1
Just	1
fancy!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
smile,	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
evidently	1
concerned	1
with	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
always	1
occupied	1
her:	1
"Now	1
you	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
forbid	1
it...	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
up	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
sly"	1
(she	1
meant	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
kissing),	1
"but	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
know	1
every	1
word	1
she	1
utters.	1
She	1
will	1
come	1
running	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
everything.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
spoil	1
her,	1
but	1
really	1
that	1
seems	1
the	1
best	1
plan.	1
With	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
I	1
was	1
stricter."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
quite	1
differently,"	1
remarked	1
the	1
handsome	1
elder	1
daughter,	1
Countess	1
Vera,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
smile	1
did	1
not	1
enhance	1
Vera's	1
beauty	1
as	1
smiles	1
generally	1
do;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
it	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
unnatural,	1
and	1
therefore	1
unpleasant,	1
expression.	1
Vera	1
was	1
good-looking,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
stupid,	1
quick	1
at	1
learning,	1
was	1
well-brought	1
up,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
voice;	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
true	1
and	1
appropriate,	1
yet,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
everyone--the	1
visitors	1
and	1
countess	1
alike--turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
wondering	1
why	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
awkward.	1
	1
"People	1
are	1
always	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
their	1
eldest	1
children	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
exceptional	1
of	1
them,"	1
said	1
the	1
visitor.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
denying	1
it,	1
my	1
dear?	1
Our	1
dear	1
countess	1
was	1
too	1
clever	1
with	1
Vera,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
that?	1
She's	1
turned	1
out	1
splendidly	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
he	1
added,	1
winking	1
at	1
Vera.	1
	1
The	1
guests	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
leave,	1
promising	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
dinner.	1
	1
"What	1
manners!	1
I	1
thought	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
go,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
guests	1
out.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
When	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
she	1
only	1
went	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
conservatory.	1
There	1
she	1
paused	1
and	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
waiting	1
for	1
Boris	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
impatient,	1
and	1
stamped	1
her	1
foot,	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
at	1
his	1
not	1
coming	1
at	1
once,	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
discreet	1
steps	1
approaching	1
neither	1
quickly	1
nor	1
slowly.	1
At	1
this	1
Natasha	1
dashed	1
swiftly	1
among	1
the	1
flower	1
tubs	1
and	1
hid	1
there.	1
	1
Boris	1
paused	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looked	1
round,	1
brushed	1
a	1
little	1
dust	1
from	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
mirror	1
examined	1
his	1
handsome	1
face.	1
Natasha,	1
very	1
still,	1
peered	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
ambush,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
He	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
smiled,	1
and	1
walked	1
toward	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
but	1
changed	1
her	1
mind.	1
"Let	1
him	1
look	1
for	1
me,"	1
thought	1
she.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Boris	1
gone	1
than	1
Sonya,	1
flushed,	1
in	1
tears,	1
and	1
muttering	1
angrily,	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
Natasha	1
checked	1
her	1
first	1
impulse	1
to	1
run	1
out	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
hiding	1
place,	1
watching--as	1
under	1
an	1
invisible	1
cap--to	1
see	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
was	1
experiencing	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
peculiar	1
pleasure.	1
Sonya,	1
muttering	1
to	1
herself,	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door.	1
It	1
opened	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
How	1
can	1
you?"	1
said	1
he,	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,	1
nothing;	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!"	1
sobbed	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
"Well,	1
if	1
you	1
do,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
her!"	1
	1
"So-o-onya!	1
Look	1
here!	1
How	1
can	1
you	1
torture	1
me	1
and	1
yourself	1
like	1
that,	1
for	1
a	1
mere	1
fancy?"	1
said	1
Nicholas	1
taking	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
Sonya	1
did	1
not	1
pull	1
it	1
away,	1
and	1
left	1
off	1
crying.	1
Natasha,	1
not	1
stirring	1
and	1
scarcely	1
breathing,	1
watched	1
from	1
her	1
ambush	1
with	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
"What	1
will	1
happen	1
now?"	1
thought	1
she.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
me?	1
You	1
alone	1
are	1
everything!"	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
like	1
that."	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
I	1
won't;	1
only	1
forgive	1
me,	1
Sonya!"	1
He	1
drew	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
nice,"	1
thought	1
Natasha;	1
and	1
when	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
conservatory	1
she	1
followed	1
and	1
called	1
Boris	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
and	1
significant	1
look.	1
"I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Here,	1
here!"	1
and	1
she	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
among	1
the	1
tubs	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
hiding.	1
	1
Boris	1
followed	1
her,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
something?"	1
asked	1
he.	1
	1
She	1
grew	1
confused,	1
glanced	1
round,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
doll	1
she	1
had	1
thrown	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
tubs,	1
picked	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
"Kiss	1
the	1
doll,"	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
Boris	1
looked	1
attentively	1
and	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
eager	1
face,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Don't	1
you	1
want	1
to?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
she,	1
and	1
went	1
further	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
threw	1
down	1
the	1
doll.	1
"Closer,	1
closer!"	1
she	1
whispered.	1
	1
She	1
caught	1
the	1
young	1
officer	1
by	1
his	1
cuffs,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
solemnity	1
and	1
fear	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
flushed	1
face.	1
	1
"And	1
me?	1
Would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
kiss	1
me?"	1
she	1
whispered	1
almost	1
inaudibly,	1
glancing	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
brows,	1
smiling,	1
and	1
almost	1
crying	1
from	1
excitement.	1
	1
Boris	1
blushed.	1
	1
"How	1
funny	1
you	1
are!"	1
he	1
said,	1
bending	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
blushing	1
still	1
more,	1
but	1
he	1
waited	1
and	1
did	1
nothing.	1
	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
onto	1
a	1
tub	1
to	1
be	1
higher	1
than	1
he,	1
embraced	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
both	1
her	1
slender	1
bare	1
arms	1
clasped	1
him	1
above	1
his	1
neck,	1
and,	1
tossing	1
back	1
her	1
hair,	1
kissed	1
him	1
full	1
on	1
the	1
lips.	1
	1
Then	1
she	1
slipped	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
flowerpots	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
tubs	1
and	1
stood,	1
hanging	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"Natasha,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
but..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me?"	1
Natasha	1
broke	1
in.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
am,	1
but	1
please	1
don't	1
let	1
us	1
do	1
like	1
that....	1
In	1
another	1
four	1
years...	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
hand."	1
	1
Natasha	1
considered.	1
	1
"Thirteen,	1
fourteen,	1
fifteen,	1
sixteen,"	1
she	1
counted	1
on	1
her	1
slender	1
little	1
fingers.	1
"All	1
right!	1
Then	1
it's	1
settled?"	1
	1
A	1
smile	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
lit	1
up	1
her	1
eager	1
face.	1
	1
"Settled!"	1
replied	1
Boris.	1
	1
"Forever?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
girl.	1
"Till	1
death	1
itself?"	1
	1
She	1
took	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
face	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
adjoining	1
sitting	1
room.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
After	1
receiving	1
her	1
visitors,	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
the	1
porter	1
was	1
told	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
to	1
dinner	1
all	1
who	1
came	1
"to	1
congratulate."	1
The	1
countess	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
tête-à-tête	1
talk	1
with	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
childhood,	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
properly	1
since	1
she	1
returned	1
from	1
Petersburg.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
her	1
tear-worn	1
but	1
pleasant	1
face,	1
drew	1
her	1
chair	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"With	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
left	1
of	1
us	1
old	1
friends!	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
so	1
value	1
your	1
friendship."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
and	1
paused.	1
The	1
countess	1
pressed	1
her	1
friend's	1
hand.	1
	1
"Vera,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
a	1
favorite,	1
"how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
tact?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
wanted	1
here?	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
girls,	1
or..."	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera	1
smiled	1
contemptuously	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
hurt.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
had	1
told	1
me	1
sooner,	1
Mamma,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
gone,"	1
she	1
replied	1
as	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room.	1
	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
passed	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
she	1
noticed	1
two	1
couples	1
sitting,	1
one	1
pair	1
at	1
each	1
window.	1
She	1
stopped	1
and	1
smiled	1
scornfully.	1
Sonya	1
was	1
sitting	1
close	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
who	1
was	1
copying	1
out	1
some	1
verses	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
written.	1
Boris	1
and	1
Natasha	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
window	1
and	1
ceased	1
talking	1
when	1
Vera	1
entered.	1
Sonya	1
and	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Vera	1
with	1
guilty,	1
happy	1
faces.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
pleasant	1
and	1
touching	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
little	1
girls	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
apparently	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
roused	1
no	1
pleasant	1
feeling	1
in	1
Vera.	1
	1
"How	1
often	1
have	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
things?"	1
she	1
said.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
room	1
of	1
your	1
own,"	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
inkstand	1
from	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
minute,	1
in	1
a	1
minute,"	1
he	1
said,	1
dipping	1
his	1
pen.	1
	1
"You	1
always	1
manage	1
to	1
do	1
things	1
at	1
the	1
wrong	1
time,"	1
continued	1
Vera.	1
"You	1
came	1
rushing	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
so	1
that	1
everyone	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
Though	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
quite	1
just,	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason	1
no	1
one	1
replied,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
simply	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
She	1
lingered	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
inkstand	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
	1
"And	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
what	1
secrets	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
between	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Boris,	1
or	1
between	1
you	1
two?	1
It's	1
all	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
"Now,	1
Vera,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
you?"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
defense,	1
speaking	1
very	1
gently.	1
	1
She	1
seemed	1
that	1
day	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
kind	1
and	1
affectionate	1
to	1
everyone.	1
	1
"Very	1
silly,"	1
said	1
Vera.	1
"I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you.	1
Secrets	1
indeed!"	1
	1
"All	1
have	1
secrets	1
of	1
their	1
own,"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
getting	1
warmer.	1
"We	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
Berg."	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
think	1
not,"	1
said	1
Vera,	1
"because	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
anything	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
behavior.	1
But	1
I'll	1
just	1
tell	1
Mamma	1
how	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
with	1
Boris."	1
	1
"Natalya	1
Ilynichna	1
behaves	1
very	1
well	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
complain	1
of."	1
	1
"Don't,	1
Boris!	1
You	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
diplomat	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
really	1
tiresome,"	1
said	1
Natasha	1
in	1
a	1
mortified	1
voice	1
that	1
trembled	1
slightly.	1
(She	1
used	1
the	1
word	1
"diplomat,"	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
among	1
the	1
children,	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
sense	1
they	1
attached	1
to	1
it.)	1
"Why	1
does	1
she	1
bother	1
me?"	1
And	1
she	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Vera,	1
"You'll	1
never	1
understand	1
it,	1
because	1
you've	1
never	1
loved	1
anyone.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
heart!	1
You	1
are	1
a	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis	1
and	1
nothing	1
more"	1
(this	1
nickname,	1
bestowed	1
on	1
Vera	1
by	1
Nicholas,	1
was	1
considered	1
very	1
stinging),	1
"and	1
your	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
people!	1
Go	1
and	1
flirt	1
with	1
Berg	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
she	1
finished	1
quickly.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
not	1
run	1
after	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
before	1
visitors..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
you've	1
done	1
what	1
you	1
wanted,"	1
put	1
in	1
Nicholas--"said	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
to	1
everyone	1
and	1
upset	1
them.	1
Let's	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
nursery."	1
	1
All	1
four,	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
scared	1
birds,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"The	1
unpleasant	1
things	1
were	1
said	1
to	1
me,"	1
remarked	1
Vera,	1
"I	1
said	1
none	1
to	1
anyone."	1
	1
"Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!	1
Madame	1
de	1
Genlis!"	1
shouted	1
laughing	1
voices	1
through	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
Vera,	1
who	1
produced	1
such	1
an	1
irritating	1
and	1
unpleasant	1
effect	1
on	1
everyone,	1
smiled	1
and,	1
evidently	1
unmoved	1
by	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
scarf.	1
Looking	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
handsome	1
face	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
become	1
still	1
colder	1
and	1
calmer.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
still	1
going	1
on.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
"my	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
all	1
roses	1
either.	1
Don't	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
we	1
are	1
living	1
our	1
means	1
won't	1
last	1
long?	1
It's	1
all	1
the	1
Club	1
and	1
his	1
easygoing	1
nature.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
do	1
we	1
get	1
any	1
rest?	1
Theatricals,	1
hunting,	1
and	1
heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
besides!	1
But	1
don't	1
let's	1
talk	1
about	1
me;	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
managed	1
everything.	1
I	1
often	1
wonder	1
at	1
you,	1
Annette--how	1
at	1
your	1
age	1
you	1
can	1
rush	1
off	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
carriage	1
to	1
Moscow,	1
to	1
Petersburg,	1
to	1
those	1
ministers	1
and	1
great	1
people,	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
all!	1
It's	1
quite	1
astonishing.	1
How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
things	1
settled?	1
I	1
couldn't	1
possibly	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
love,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"God	1
grant	1
you	1
never	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
widow	1
without	1
means	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
son	1
you	1
love	1
to	1
distraction!	1
One	1
learns	1
many	1
things	1
then,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
pride.	1
"That	1
lawsuit	1
taught	1
me	1
much.	1
When	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
big	1
people	1
I	1
write	1
a	1
note:	1
'Princess	1
So-and-So	1
desires	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
So	1
and-So,'	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
go	1
myself	1
two,	1
three,	1
or	1
four	1
times--	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
what	1
I	1
want.	1
I	1
don't	1
mind	1
what	1
they	1
think	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply	1
about	1
Bory?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"You	1
see	1
yours	1
is	1
already	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Guards,	1
while	1
my	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
as	1
a	1
cadet.	1
There's	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
interest	1
himself	1
for	1
him.	1
To	1
whom	1
did	1
you	1
apply?"	1
	1
"To	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
kind.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
agreed	1
to	1
everything,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
enthusiastically,	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
all	1
the	1
humiliation	1
she	1
had	1
endured	1
to	1
gain	1
her	1
end.	1
	1
"Has	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
aged	1
much?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
since	1
we	1
acted	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
Rumyantsovs'	1
theatricals.	1
I	1
expect	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
He	1
paid	1
me	1
attentions	1
in	1
those	1
days,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever,"	1
replied	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"overflowing	1
with	1
amiability.	1
His	1
position	1
has	1
not	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
'I	1
am	1
sorry	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
so	1
little	1
for	1
you,	1
dear	1
Princess.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
command.'	1
Yes,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
relation.	1
But,	1
Nataly,	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
love	1
for	1
my	1
son:	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
happiness!	1
And	1
my	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
that	1
my	1
position	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
terrible	1
one,"	1
continued	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
sadly,	1
dropping	1
her	1
voice.	1
"My	1
wretched	1
lawsuit	1
takes	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
makes	1
no	1
progress.	1
Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
literally	1
not	1
a	1
penny	1
and	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
equip	1
Boris."	1
She	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
"I	1
need	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
and	1
have	1
only	1
one	1
twenty-five-ruble	1
note.	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state....	1
My	1
only	1
hope	1
now	1
is	1
in	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov.	1
If	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
assist	1
his	1
godson--you	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
Bory's	1
godfather--and	1
allow	1
him	1
something	1
for	1
his	1
maintenance,	1
all	1
my	1
trouble	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
thrown	1
away....	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
equip	1
him."	1
	1
The	1
countess'	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
she	1
pondered	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"I	1
often	1
think,	1
though,	1
perhaps	1
it's	1
a	1
sin,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
"that	1
here	1
lives	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov	1
so	1
rich,	1
all	1
alone...	1
that	1
tremendous	1
fortune...	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
life	1
worth?	1
It's	1
a	1
burden	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Bory's	1
life	1
is	1
only	1
just	1
beginning...."	1
	1
"Surely	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
something	1
to	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows,	1
my	1
dear!	1
These	1
rich	1
grandees	1
are	1
so	1
selfish.	1
Still,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
Boris	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
straight	1
out.	1
Let	1
people	1
think	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
of	1
me,	1
it's	1
really	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
my	1
son's	1
fate	1
is	1
at	1
stake."	1
The	1
princess	1
rose.	1
"It's	1
now	1
two	1
o'clock	1
and	1
you	1
dine	1
at	1
four.	1
There	1
will	1
just	1
be	1
time."	1
	1
And	1
like	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
time,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sent	1
someone	1
to	1
call	1
her	1
son,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
countess	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
son	1
should	1
not	1
hear,	1
"Wish	1
me	1
good	1
luck."	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
coming	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
dining	1
hall	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
and	1
he	1
added:	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
better,	1
ask	1
Pierre	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
us.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
the	1
children.	1
Be	1
sure	1
to	1
invite	1
him,	1
my	1
dear.	1
We	1
will	1
see	1
how	1
Taras	1
distinguishes	1
himself	1
today.	1
He	1
says	1
Count	1
Orlov	1
never	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
dinner	1
as	1
ours	1
will	1
be!"	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
as	1
Countess	1
Rostova's	1
carriage	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
drove	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
covered	1
street	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
wide	1
courtyard	1
of	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Boris,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother,	1
drawing	1
her	1
hand	1
from	1
beneath	1
her	1
old	1
mantle	1
and	1
laying	1
it	1
timidly	1
and	1
tenderly	1
on	1
her	1
son's	1
arm,	1
"be	1
affectionate	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him.	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
your	1
godfather	1
after	1
all,	1
your	1
future	1
depends	1
on	1
him.	1
Remember	1
that,	1
my	1
dear,	1
and	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
you	1
so	1
well	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
be."	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
anything	1
besides	1
humiliation	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it..."	1
answered	1
her	1
son	1
coldly.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
your	1
sake."	1
	1
Although	1
the	1
hall	1
porter	1
saw	1
someone's	1
carriage	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
entrance,	1
after	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son	1
(who	1
without	1
asking	1
to	1
be	1
announced	1
had	1
passed	1
straight	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
porch	1
between	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
statues	1
in	1
niches)	1
and	1
looking	1
significantly	1
at	1
the	1
lady's	1
old	1
cloak,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
they	1
wanted	1
the	1
count	1
or	1
the	1
princesses,	1
and,	1
hearing	1
that	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
said	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
worse	1
today,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
excellency	1
was	1
not	1
receiving	1
anyone.	1
	1
"We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
go	1
back,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"My	1
dear!"	1
exclaimed	1
his	1
mother	1
imploringly,	1
again	1
laying	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
if	1
that	1
touch	1
might	1
soothe	1
or	1
rouse	1
him.	1
	1
Boris	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
mother	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cloak.	1
	1
"My	1
friend,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
gentle	1
tones,	1
addressing	1
the	1
hall	1
porter,	1
"I	1
know	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
is	1
very	1
ill...	1
that's	1
why	1
I	1
have	1
come...	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
relation.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
disturb	1
him,	1
my	1
friend...	1
I	1
only	1
need	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich:	1
he	1
is	1
staying	1
here,	1
is	1
he	1
not?	1
Please	1
announce	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
hall	1
porter	1
sullenly	1
pulled	1
a	1
bell	1
that	1
rang	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
"Princess	1
Drubetskaya	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Sergeevich,"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
a	1
footman	1
dressed	1
in	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
shoes,	1
and	1
a	1
swallow-tail	1
coat,	1
who	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
and	1
looked	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
halfway	1
landing.	1
	1
The	1
mother	1
smoothed	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
her	1
dyed	1
silk	1
dress	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
Venetian	1
mirror	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
trodden-down	1
shoes	1
briskly	1
ascended	1
the	1
carpeted	1
stairs.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
once	1
more	1
stimulating	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
touch,	1
"you	1
promised	1
me!"	1
	1
The	1
son,	1
lowering	1
his	1
eyes,	1
followed	1
her	1
quietly.	1
	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
from	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
apartments	1
assigned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
son,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
their	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
elderly	1
footman	1
who	1
had	1
sprung	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
entered,	1
the	1
bronze	1
handle	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doors	1
turned	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
out--wearing	1
a	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
single	1
star	1
on	1
his	1
breast,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
when	1
at	1
home--taking	1
leave	1
of	1
a	1
good-looking,	1
dark-haired	1
man.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Petersburg	1
doctor,	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
certain?"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"Prince,	1
humanum	1
est	1
errare,	1
*	1
but..."	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
swallowing	1
his	1
r's,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
Latin	1
words	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent.	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
err	1
is	1
human.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
Seeing	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
her	1
son,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
dismissed	1
the	1
doctor	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
and	1
approached	1
them	1
silently	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
inquiry.	1
The	1
son	1
noticed	1
that	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
profound	1
sorrow	1
suddenly	1
clouded	1
his	1
mother's	1
face,	1
and	1
he	1
smiled	1
slightly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Prince!	1
In	1
what	1
sad	1
circumstances	1
we	1
meet	1
again!	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
our	1
dear	1
invalid?"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
though	1
unaware	1
of	1
the	1
cold	1
offensive	1
look	1
fixed	1
on	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
stared	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
at	1
Boris	1
questioningly	1
and	1
perplexed.	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
politely.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
without	1
acknowledging	1
the	1
bow	1
turned	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
answering	1
her	1
query	1
by	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
lips	1
indicating	1
very	1
little	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
patient.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
exclaimed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
awful!	1
It	1
is	1
terrible	1
to	1
think....	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
son,"	1
she	1
added,	1
indicating	1
Boris.	1
"He	1
wanted	1
to	1
thank	1
you	1
himself."	1
	1
Boris	1
bowed	1
again	1
politely.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
Prince,	1
a	1
mother's	1
heart	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
for	1
us."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
service,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
arranging	1
his	1
lace	1
frill,	1
and	1
in	1
tone	1
and	1
manner,	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
placed	1
under	1
an	1
obligation,	1
assuming	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
much	1
greater	1
importance	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
at	1
Anna	1
Scherer's	1
reception.	1
	1
"Try	1
to	1
serve	1
well	1
and	1
show	1
yourself	1
worthy,"	1
added	1
he,	1
addressing	1
Boris	1
with	1
severity.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad....	1
Are	1
you	1
here	1
on	1
leave?"	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
tone	1
of	1
indifference.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
awaiting	1
orders	1
to	1
join	1
my	1
new	1
regiment,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
betraying	1
neither	1
annoyance	1
at	1
the	1
prince's	1
brusque	1
manner	1
nor	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
conversation,	1
but	1
speaking	1
so	1
quietly	1
and	1
respectfully	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
searching	1
glance.	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
living	1
with	1
your	1
mother?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
living	1
at	1
Countess	1
Rostova's,"	1
replied	1
Boris,	1
again	1
adding,	1
"your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"That	1
is,	1
with	1
Ilya	1
Rostov	1
who	1
married	1
Nataly	1
Shinshina,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
his	1
monotonous	1
voice.	1
"I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
how	1
Nataly	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
that	1
unlicked	1
bear!	1
A	1
perfectly	1
absurd	1
and	1
stupid	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
gambler	1
too,	1
I	1
am	1
told."	1
	1
"But	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
man,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
pathetic	1
smile,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
too	1
knew	1
that	1
Count	1
Rostov	1
deserved	1
this	1
censure,	1
but	1
asked	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
hard	1
on	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
man.	1
"What	1
do	1
the	1
doctors	1
say?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
her	1
worn	1
face	1
again	1
expressing	1
deep	1
sorrow.	1
	1
"They	1
give	1
little	1
hope,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
thank	1
Uncle	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
Boris.	1
He	1
is	1
his	1
godson,"	1
she	1
added,	1
her	1
tone	1
suggesting	1
that	1
this	1
fact	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
much	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
became	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
frowned.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
a	1
rival	1
for	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
fortune,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
reassure	1
him.	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
my	1
sincere	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
Uncle,"	1
said	1
she,	1
uttering	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
peculiar	1
assurance	1
and	1
unconcern,	1
"I	1
know	1
his	1
character:	1
noble,	1
upright...	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
him	1
except	1
the	1
young	1
princesses....	1
They	1
are	1
still	1
young...."	1
She	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Has	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
final	1
duty,	1
Prince?	1
How	1
priceless	1
are	1
those	1
last	1
moments!	1
It	1
can	1
make	1
things	1
no	1
worse,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
prepare	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill.	1
We	1
women,	1
Prince,"	1
and	1
she	1
smiled	1
tenderly,	1
"always	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
say	1
these	1
things.	1
I	1
absolutely	1
must	1
see	1
him,	1
however	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
used	1
to	1
suffering."	1
	1
Evidently	1
the	1
prince	1
understood	1
her,	1
and	1
also	1
understood,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
meeting	1
be	1
too	1
trying	1
for	1
him,	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Let	1
us	1
wait	1
until	1
evening.	1
The	1
doctors	1
are	1
expecting	1
a	1
crisis."	1
	1
"But	1
one	1
cannot	1
delay,	1
Prince,	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment!	1
Consider	1
that	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
at	1
stake.	1
Ah,	1
it	1
is	1
awful:	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
a	1
Christian..."	1
	1
A	1
door	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inner	1
rooms	1
opened	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
the	1
count's	1
niece,	1
entered	1
with	1
a	1
cold,	1
stern	1
face.	1
The	1
length	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
was	1
strikingly	1
out	1
of	1
proportion	1
to	1
her	1
short	1
legs.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turned	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
is	1
he?"	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
expect,	1
this	1
noise..."	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
looking	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
at	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
hardly	1
knew	1
you,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
smile,	1
ambling	1
lightly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
niece.	1
"I	1
have	1
come,	1
and	1
am	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
to	1
help	1
you	1
nurse	1
my	1
uncle.	1
I	1
imagine	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
gone	1
through,"	1
and	1
she	1
sympathetically	1
turned	1
up	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
no	1
reply	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
smile,	1
but	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
gloves	1
and,	1
occupying	1
the	1
position	1
she	1
had	1
conquered,	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
inviting	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
her.	1
	1
"Boris,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
my	1
uncle;	1
but	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
Pierre	1
meanwhile	1
and	1
don't	1
forget	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
invitation.	1
They	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner.	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
won't	1
go?"	1
she	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
replied	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
had	1
plainly	1
become	1
depressed,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad	1
if	1
you	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
man....	1
Here	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
not	1
once	1
asked	1
for	1
him."	1
	1
He	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
A	1
footman	1
conducted	1
Boris	1
down	1
one	1
flight	1
of	1
stairs	1
and	1
up	1
another,	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
rooms.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Pierre,	1
after	1
all,	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
himself	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
expelled	1
from	1
there	1
for	1
riotous	1
conduct	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
Moscow.	1
The	1
story	1
told	1
about	1
him	1
at	1
Count	1
Rostov's	1
was	1
true.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
tying	1
a	1
policeman	1
to	1
a	1
bear.	1
He	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
was	1
staying	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
his	1
father's	1
house.	1
Though	1
he	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
escapade	1
would	1
be	1
already	1
known	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
about	1
his	1
father--who	1
were	1
never	1
favorably	1
disposed	1
toward	1
him--would	1
have	1
used	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count	1
against	1
him,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Entering	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where	1
the	1
princesses	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
time,	1
he	1
greeted	1
the	1
ladies,	1
two	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
embroidery	1
frames	1
while	1
a	1
third	1
read	1
aloud.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
eldest	1
who	1
was	1
reading--the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
met	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
two	1
younger	1
ones	1
were	1
embroidering:	1
both	1
were	1
rosy	1
and	1
pretty	1
and	1
they	1
differed	1
only	1
in	1
that	1
one	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
mole	1
on	1
her	1
lip	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
much	1
prettier.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
received	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
corpse	1
or	1
a	1
leper.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
paused	1
in	1
her	1
reading	1
and	1
silently	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes;	1
the	1
second	1
assumed	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
expression;	1
while	1
the	1
youngest,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
cheerful	1
and	1
lively	1
disposition,	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
frame	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile	1
probably	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
amusing	1
scene	1
she	1
foresaw.	1
She	1
drew	1
her	1
wool	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
canvas	1
and,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
laughing,	1
stooped	1
as	1
if	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
pattern.	1
	1
"How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
cousin?"	1
said	1
Pierre.	1
"You	1
don't	1
recognize	1
me?"	1
	1
"I	1
recognize	1
you	1
only	1
too	1
well,	1
too	1
well."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
the	1
count?	1
Can	1
I	1
see	1
him?"	1
asked	1
Pierre,	1
awkwardly	1
as	1
usual,	1
but	1
unabashed.	1
	1
"The	1
count	1
is	1
suffering	1
physically	1
and	1
mentally,	1
and	1
apparently	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
your	1
best	1
to	1
increase	1
his	1
mental	1
sufferings."	1
	1
"Can	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
count?"	1
Pierre	1
again	1
asked.	1
	1
"Hm....	1
If	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
outright,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
him...	1
Olga,	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
Uncle's	1
beef	1
tea	1
is	1
ready--it	1
is	1
almost	1
time,"	1
she	1
added,	1
giving	1
Pierre	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
busy,	1
and	1
busy	1
making	1
his	1
father	1
comfortable,	1
while	1
evidently	1
he,	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
only	1
busy	1
causing	1
him	1
annoyance.	1
	1
Olga	1
went	1
out.	1
Pierre	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sisters;	1
then	1
he	1
bowed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
rooms.	1
You	1
will	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
low	1
but	1
ringing	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
sister	1
with	1
the	1
mole.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
arrived	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house.	1
He	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
behave	1
here	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
you	1
will	1
end	1
very	1
badly;	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
count	1
is	1
very,	1
very	1
ill,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Since	1
then	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
disturbed	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
rooms	1
upstairs.	1
	1
When	1
Boris	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
door	1
Pierre	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
his	1
room,	1
stopping	1
occasionally	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
make	1
menacing	1
gestures	1
at	1
the	1
wall,	1
as	1
if	1
running	1
a	1
sword	1
through	1
an	1
invisible	1
foe,	1
and	1
glaring	1
savagely	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
resuming	1
his	1
walk,	1
muttering	1
indistinct	1
words,	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
	1
"England	1
is	1
done	1
for,"	1
said	1
he,	1
scowling	1
and	1
pointing	1
his	1
finger	1
at	1
someone	1
unseen.	1
"Mr.	1
Pitt,	1
as	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
man,	1
is	1
sentenced	1
to..."	1
But	1
before	1
Pierre--who	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
imagined	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
Napoleon	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
just	1
effected	1
the	1
dangerous	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Dover	1
and	1
captured	1
London--could	1
pronounce	1
Pitt's	1
sentence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
well-built	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
officer	1
entering	1
his	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
paused.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
Moscow	1
when	1
Boris	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
and	1
had	1
quite	1
forgotten	1
him,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
impulsive	1
and	1
hearty	1
way	1
he	1
took	1
Boris	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
smile.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
me?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
quietly	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
"I	1
have	1
come	1
with	1
my	1
mother	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
well."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
ill.	1
People	1
are	1
always	1
disturbing	1
him,"	1
answered	1
Pierre,	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
who	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
was.	1
	1
Boris	1
felt	1
that	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
recognize	1
him	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
introduce	1
himself,	1
and	1
without	1
experiencing	1
the	1
least	1
embarrassment	1
looked	1
Pierre	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
	1
"Count	1
Rostov	1
asks	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
today,"	1
said	1
he,	1
after	1
a	1
considerable	1
pause	1
which	1
made	1
Pierre	1
feel	1
uncomfortable.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Count	1
Rostov!"	1
exclaimed	1
Pierre	1
joyfully.	1
"Then	1
you	1
are	1
his	1
son,	1
Ilya?	1
Only	1
fancy,	1
I	1
didn't	1
know	1
you	1
at	1
first.	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Sparrow	1
Hills	1
with	1
Madame	1
Jacquot?...	1
It's	1
such	1
an	1
age..."	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
deliberately,	1
with	1
a	1
bold	1
and	1
slightly	1
sarcastic	1
smile.	1
"I	1
am	1
Boris,	1
son	1
of	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
Drubetskaya.	1
Rostov,	1
the	1
father,	1
is	1
Ilya,	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
Nicholas.	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
any	1
Madame	1
Jacquot."	1
	1
Pierre	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
attacked	1
by	1
mosquitoes	1
or	1
bees.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
thinking	1
about?	1
I've	1
mixed	1
everything	1
up.	1
One	1
has	1
so	1
many	1
relatives	1
in	1
Moscow!	1
So	1
you	1
are	1
Boris?	1
Of	1
course.	1
Well,	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
are.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition?	1
The	1
English	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
badly,	1
you	1
know,	1
if	1
Napoleon	1
gets	1
across	1
the	1
Channel.	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
expedition	1
is	1
quite	1
feasible.	1
If	1
only	1
Villeneuve	1
doesn't	1
make	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
things!"	1
	1
Boris	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Villeneuve's	1
name.	1
	1
"We	1
here	1
in	1
Moscow	1
are	1
more	1
occupied	1
with	1
dinner	1
parties	1
and	1
scandal	1
than	1
with	1
politics,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
his	1
quiet	1
ironical	1
tone.	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
Moscow	1
is	1
chiefly	1
busy	1
with	1
gossip,"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"Just	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
father."	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled	1
in	1
his	1
good-natured	1
way	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
for	1
his	1
companion's	1
sake	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
might	1
say	1
something	1
he	1
would	1
afterwards	1
regret.	1
But	1
Boris	1
spoke	1
distinctly,	1
clearly,	1
and	1
dryly,	1
looking	1
straight	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Moscow	1
has	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
gossip,"	1
Boris	1
went	1
on.	1
"Everybody	1
is	1
wondering	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
count	1
will	1
leave	1
his	1
fortune,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
perhaps	1
outlive	1
us	1
all,	1
as	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
he	1
will..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
horrid,"	1
interrupted	1
Pierre,	1
"very	1
horrid."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
still	1
afraid	1
that	1
this	1
officer	1
might	1
inadvertently	1
say	1
something	1
disconcerting	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
"And	1
it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you,"	1
said	1
Boris	1
flushing	1
slightly,	1
but	1
not	1
changing	1
his	1
tone	1
or	1
attitude,	1
"it	1
must	1
seem	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
everyone	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
man?"	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
does,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
just	1
wish	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
avoid	1
misunderstandings,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
reckon	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
mother	1
among	1
such	1
people.	1
We	1
are	1
very	1
poor,	1
but	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
reason	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
rich,	1
I	1
don't	1
regard	1
myself	1
as	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
neither	1
I	1
nor	1
my	1
mother	1
would	1
ever	1
ask	1
or	1
take	1
anything	1
from	1
him."	1
	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
understand,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did,	1
he	1
jumped	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sofa,	1
seized	1
Boris	1
under	1
the	1
elbow	1
in	1
his	1
quick,	1
clumsy	1
way,	1
and,	1
blushing	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
Boris,	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
mingled	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
this	1
is	1
strange!	1
Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
I...	1
who	1
could	1
think?...	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well..."	1
	1
But	1
Boris	1
again	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
out	1
fully.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
it?	1
You	1
must	1
excuse	1
me,"	1
said	1
he,	1
putting	1
Pierre	1
at	1
ease	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
put	1
at	1
ease	1
by	1
him,	1
"but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
offended	1
you.	1
I	1
always	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
rule	1
to	1
speak	1
out...	1
Well,	1
what	1
answer	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
take?	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'?"	1
	1
And	1
Boris,	1
having	1
apparently	1
relieved	1
himself	1
of	1
an	1
onerous	1
duty	1
and	1
extricated	1
himself	1
from	1
an	1
awkward	1
situation	1
and	1
placed	1
another	1
in	1
it,	1
became	1
quite	1
pleasant	1
again.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
I	1
say,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
calming	1
down,	1
"you	1
are	1
a	1
wonderful	1
fellow!	1
What	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
is	1
good,	1
very	1
good.	1
Of	1
course	1
you	1
don't	1
know	1
me.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
time...	1
not	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
children.	1
You	1
might	1
think	1
that	1
I...	1
I	1
understand,	1
quite	1
understand.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
myself,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
courage,	1
but	1
it's	1
splendid.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
acquaintance.	1
It's	1
queer,"	1
he	1
added	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
suspected	1
me!"	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it!	1
I	1
hope	1
we'll	1
get	1
better	1
acquainted,"	1
and	1
he	1
pressed	1
Boris'	1
hand.	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
sent	1
for	1
me....	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
one	1
do?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you	1
think	1
Napoleon	1
will	1
manage	1
to	1
get	1
an	1
army	1
across?"	1
asked	1
Boris	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Pierre	1
saw	1
that	1
Boris	1
wished	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
he	1
began	1
explaining	1
the	1
advantages	1
and	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
the	1
Boulogne	1
expedition.	1
	1
A	1
footman	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
Boris--the	1
princess	1
was	1
going.	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
Boris'	1
better	1
acquaintance,	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
looked	1
affectionately	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
into	1
Boris'	1
eyes.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
Pierre	1
continued	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
no	1
longer	1
piercing	1
an	1
imaginary	1
foe	1
with	1
his	1
imaginary	1
sword,	1
but	1
smiling	1
at	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
that	1
pleasant,	1
intelligent,	1
and	1
resolute	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
As	1
often	1
happens	1
in	1
early	1
youth,	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
leads	1
a	1
lonely	1
life,	1
he	1
felt	1
an	1
unaccountable	1
tenderness	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
friends.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
off.	1
She	1
held	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
tearful.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
dreadful,	1
dreadful!"	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
"but	1
cost	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
my	1
duty.	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
night.	1
He	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
like	1
this.	1
Every	1
moment	1
is	1
precious.	1
I	1
can't	1
think	1
why	1
his	1
nieces	1
put	1
it	1
off.	1
Perhaps	1
God	1
will	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
him!...	1
Adieu,	1
Prince!	1
May	1
God	1
support	1
you..."	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
ma	1
bonne,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state,"	1
said	1
the	1
mother	1
to	1
her	1
son	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
"He	1
hardly	1
recognizes	1
anybody."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand,	1
Mamma--what	1
is	1
his	1
attitude	1
to	1
Pierre?"	1
asked	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"The	1
will	1
will	1
show	1
that,	1
my	1
dear;	1
our	1
fate	1
also	1
depends	1
on	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
anything?"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear!	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
poor!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
that	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason,	1
Mamma..."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Heaven!	1
How	1
ill	1
he	1
is!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
mother.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
After	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
driven	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
son	1
to	1
visit	1
Count	1
Cyril	1
Vladimirovich	1
Bezukhov,	1
Countess	1
Rostova	1
sat	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
all	1
alone	1
applying	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
her	1
eyes.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
rang.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
she	1
said	1
crossly	1
to	1
the	1
maid	1
who	1
kept	1
her	1
waiting	1
some	1
minutes.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
serve	1
me?	1
Then	1
I'll	1
find	1
you	1
another	1
place."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
upset	1
by	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow	1
and	1
humiliating	1
poverty,	1
and	1
was	1
therefore	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
with	1
her	1
always	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
calling	1
her	1
maid	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
politeness.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,	1
ma'am,"	1
answered	1
the	1
maid.	1
	1
"Ask	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
me."	1
	1
The	1
count	1
came	1
waddling	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
a	1
rather	1
guilty	1
look	1
as	1
usual.	1
	1
"Well,	1
little	1
countess?	1
What	1
a	1
saute	1
of	1
game	1
au	1
madere	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have,	1
my	1
dear!	1
I	1
tasted	1
it.	1
The	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
I	1
paid	1
for	1
Taras	1
were	1
not	1
ill-	1
spent.	1
He	1
is	1
worth	1
it!"	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
ruffling	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
your	1
commands,	1
little	1
countess?"	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear...	1
What's	1
that	1
mess?"	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
"It's	1
the	1
saute,	1
most	1
likely,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
Count,	1
I	1
want	1
some	1
money."	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
became	1
sad.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
little	1
countess!"...	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
began	1
bustling	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
his	1
pocketbook.	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Count!	1
I	1
want	1
five	1
hundred	1
rubles,"	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
cambric	1
handkerchief	1
she	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
husband's	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
immediately,	1
immediately!	1
Hey,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
only	1
used	1
by	1
persons	1
who	1
are	1
certain	1
that	1
those	1
they	1
call	1
will	1
rush	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
summons.	1
"Send	1
Dmitri	1
to	1
me!"	1
	1
Dmitri,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
family	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
count's	1
house	1
and	1
now	1
managed	1
all	1
his	1
affairs,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
to	1
the	1
deferential	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
entered.	1
"Bring	1
me..."	1
he	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment,	1
"yes,	1
bring	1
me	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubles,	1
yes!	1
But	1
mind,	1
don't	1
bring	1
me	1
such	1
tattered	1
and	1
dirty	1
notes	1
as	1
last	1
time,	1
but	1
nice	1
clean	1
ones	1
for	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Dmitri,	1
clean	1
ones,	1
please,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess,	1
sighing	1
deeply.	1
	1
"When	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
them,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
Dmitri.	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
inform	1
you...	1
But,	1
don't	1
be	1
uneasy,"	1
he	1
added,	1
noticing	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
breathe	1
heavily	1
and	1
quickly	1
which	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
approaching	1
anger.	1
"I	1
was	1
forgetting...	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
it	1
brought	1
at	1
once?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes;	1
just	1
so!	1
Bring	1
it.	1
Give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
countess."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
treasure	1
that	1
Dmitri	1
is,"	1
added	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
departed.	1
"There	1
is	1
never	1
any	1
'impossible'	1
with	1
him.	1
That's	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
hate!	1
Everything	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
money,	1
Count,	1
money!	1
How	1
much	1
sorrow	1
it	1
causes	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
"But	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
great	1
need	1
of	1
this	1
sum."	1
	1
"You,	1
my	1
little	1
countess,	1
are	1
a	1
notorious	1
spendthrift,"	1
said	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
having	1
kissed	1
his	1
wife's	1
hand	1
he	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
When	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
from	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
the	1
money,	1
all	1
in	1
clean	1
notes,	1
was	1
lying	1
ready	1
under	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
on	1
the	1
countess'	1
little	1
table,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
noticed	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
agitating	1
her.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
state	1
he	1
is	1
in!	1
One	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
ill!	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
there	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
and	1
hardly	1
said	1
a	1
word..."	1
	1
"Annette,	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake	1
don't	1
refuse	1
me,"	1
the	1
countess	1
began,	1
with	1
a	1
blush	1
that	1
looked	1
very	1
strange	1
on	1
her	1
thin,	1
dignified,	1
elderly	1
face,	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
handkerchief.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
instantly	1
guessed	1
her	1
intention	1
and	1
stooped	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
countess	1
at	1
the	1
appropriate	1
moment.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
for	1
Boris	1
from	1
me,	1
for	1
his	1
outfit."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
already	1
embracing	1
her	1
and	1
weeping.	1
The	1
countess	1
wept	1
too.	1
They	1
wept	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
friends,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
kindhearted,	1
and	1
because	1
they--friends	1
from	1
childhood--had	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
thing	1
as	1
money,	1
and	1
because	1
their	1
youth	1
was	1
over....	1
But	1
those	1
tears	1
were	1
pleasant	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Countess	1
Rostova,	1
with	1
her	1
daughters	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
guests,	1
was	1
already	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
count	1
took	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
into	1
his	1
study	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
his	1
choice	1
collection	1
of	1
Turkish	1
pipes.	1
From	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
ask:	1
"Hasn't	1
she	1
come	1
yet?"	1
They	1
were	1
expecting	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
Akhrosimova,	1
known	1
in	1
society	1
as	1
le	1
terrible	1
dragon,	1
a	1
lady	1
distinguished	1
not	1
for	1
wealth	1
or	1
rank,	1
but	1
for	1
common	1
sense	1
and	1
frank	1
plainness	1
of	1
speech.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
Moscow	1
and	1
Petersburg,	1
and	1
both	1
cities	1
wondered	1
at	1
her,	1
laughed	1
privately	1
at	1
her	1
rudenesses,	1
and	1
told	1
good	1
stories	1
about	1
her,	1
while	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
all	1
without	1
exception	1
respected	1
and	1
feared	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
count's	1
room,	1
which	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
tobacco	1
smoke,	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
war	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
announced	1
in	1
a	1
manifesto,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
recruiting.	1
None	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
yet	1
seen	1
the	1
manifesto,	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
knew	1
it	1
had	1
appeared.	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
between	1
two	1
guests	1
who	1
were	1
smoking	1
and	1
talking.	1
He	1
neither	1
smoked	1
nor	1
talked,	1
but	1
bending	1
his	1
head	1
first	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
watched	1
the	1
smokers	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
neighbors,	1
whom	1
he	1
egged	1
on	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
sallow,	1
clean-shaven	1
civilian	1
with	1
a	1
thin	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
face,	1
already	1
growing	1
old,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
most	1
fashionable	1
young	1
man.	1
He	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
as	1
if	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
and,	1
having	1
stuck	1
an	1
amber	1
mouthpiece	1
far	1
into	1
his	1
mouth,	1
was	1
inhaling	1
the	1
smoke	1
spasmodically	1
and	1
screwing	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
This	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
bachelor,	1
Shinshin,	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
the	1
countess',	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
"a	1
sharp	1
tongue"	1
as	1
they	1
said	1
in	1
Moscow	1
society.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
condescending	1
to	1
his	1
companion.	1
The	1
latter,	1
a	1
fresh,	1
rosy	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
irreproachably	1
washed,	1
brushed,	1
and	1
buttoned,	1
held	1
his	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
with	1
red	1
lips	1
gently	1
inhaled	1
the	1
smoke,	1
letting	1
it	1
escape	1
from	1
his	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
in	1
rings.	1
This	1
was	1
Lieutenant	1
Berg,	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
Semenov	1
regiment	1
with	1
whom	1
Boris	1
was	1
to	1
travel	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
about	1
whom	1
Natasha	1
had	1
teased	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
Vera,	1
speaking	1
of	1
Berg	1
as	1
her	1
"intended."	1
The	1
count	1
sat	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
listened	1
attentively.	1
His	1
favorite	1
occupation	1
when	1
not	1
playing	1
boston,	1
a	1
card	1
game	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of,	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
listener,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
two	1
loquacious	1
talkers	1
at	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
old	1
chap,	1
mon	1
tres	1
honorable	1
Alphonse	1
Karlovich,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
laughing	1
ironically	1
and	1
mixing	1
the	1
most	1
ordinary	1
Russian	1
expressions	1
with	1
the	1
choicest	1
French	1
phrases--which	1
was	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
his	1
speech.	1
"Vous	1
comptez	1
vous	1
faire	1
des	1
rentes	1
sur	1
l'etat;	1
*	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
company?"	1
	1
	1
*	1
You	1
expect	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
income	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
	1
"No,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich;	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
the	1
advantages	1
are	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
infantry.	1
Just	1
consider	1
my	1
own	1
position	1
now,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich..."	1
	1
Berg	1
always	1
spoke	1
quietly,	1
politely,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
precision.	1
His	1
conversation	1
always	1
related	1
entirely	1
to	1
himself;	1
he	1
would	1
remain	1
calm	1
and	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
talk	1
related	1
to	1
any	1
topic	1
that	1
had	1
no	1
direct	1
bearing	1
on	1
himself.	1
He	1
could	1
remain	1
silent	1
for	1
hours	1
without	1
being	1
at	1
all	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
himself	1
or	1
making	1
others	1
uncomfortable,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
conversation	1
concerned	1
himself	1
he	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
talk	1
circumstantially	1
and	1
with	1
evident	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
"Consider	1
my	1
position,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich.	1
Were	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry	1
I	1
should	1
get	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
rubles	1
every	1
four	1
months,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
lieutenant;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
receive	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty,"	1
said	1
he,	1
looking	1
at	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
a	1
joyful,	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
obvious	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
success	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
desire	1
of	1
everyone	1
else.	1
	1
"Besides	1
that,	1
Peter	1
Nikolaevich,	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
prominent	1
position,"	1
continued	1
Berg,	1
"and	1
vacancies	1
occur	1
much	1
more	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
Foot	1
Guards.	1
Then	1
just	1
think	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
thirty	1
rubles!	1
I	1
even	1
manage	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
little	1
aside	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
something	1
to	1
my	1
father,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
emitting	1
a	1
smoke	1
ring.	1
	1
"La	1
balance	1
y	1
est...	1
*	1
A	1
German	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
skin	1
a	1
flint,	1
as	1
the	1
proverb	1
says,"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin,	1
moving	1
his	1
pipe	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
winking	1
at	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
	1
*	1
So	1
that	1
squares	1
matters.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
seeing	1
that	1
Shinshin	1
was	1
talking	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
listen.	1
Berg,	1
oblivious	1
of	1
irony	1
or	1
indifference,	1
continued	1
to	1
explain	1
how	1
by	1
exchanging	1
into	1
the	1
Guards	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
step	1
on	1
his	1
old	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
Cadet	1
Corps;	1
how	1
in	1
wartime	1
the	1
company	1
commander	1
might	1
get	1
killed	1
and	1
he,	1
as	1
senior	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
might	1
easily	1
succeed	1
to	1
the	1
post;	1
how	1
popular	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
how	1
satisfied	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
Berg	1
evidently	1
enjoyed	1
narrating	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
others,	1
too,	1
might	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
interests.	1
But	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
prettily	1
sedate,	1
and	1
the	1
naivete	1
of	1
his	1
youthful	1
egotism	1
was	1
so	1
obvious,	1
that	1
he	1
disarmed	1
his	1
hearers.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
boy,	1
you'll	1
get	1
along	1
wherever	1
you	1
go--foot	1
or	1
horse--that	1
I'll	1
warrant,"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
patting	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
sofa.	1
	1
Berg	1
smiled	1
joyously.	1
The	1
count,	1
by	1
his	1
guests,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
moment	1
before	1
a	1
big	1
dinner	1
when	1
the	1
assembled	1
guests,	1
expecting	1
the	1
summons	1
to	1
zakuska,	1
*	1
avoid	1
engaging	1
in	1
any	1
long	1
conversation	1
but	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
and	1
talk,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
impatient	1
for	1
their	1
food.	1
The	1
host	1
and	1
hostess	1
look	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
glance	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
visitors	1
try	1
to	1
guess	1
from	1
these	1
glances	1
who,	1
or	1
what,	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
for--some	1
important	1
relation	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
arrived,	1
or	1
a	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ready.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Hors	1
d'oeuvres.	1
	1
Pierre	1
had	1
come	1
just	1
at	1
dinnertime	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
awkwardly	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
across,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
everyone.	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
talk,	1
but	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
naively	1
looking	1
around	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
somebody	1
and	1
answered	1
all	1
her	1
questions	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
fact.	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
knowing	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
bear,	1
looked	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
this	1
big,	1
stout,	1
quiet	1
man,	1
wondering	1
how	1
such	1
a	1
clumsy,	1
modest	1
fellow	1
could	1
have	1
played	1
such	1
a	1
prank	1
on	1
a	1
policeman.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
only	1
lately	1
arrived?"	1
the	1
countess	1
asked	1
him.	1
	1
"Oui,	1
madame,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
looking	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
my	1
husband?"	1
	1
"Non,	1
madame."	1
He	1
smiled	1
quite	1
inappropriately.	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
Paris	1
recently,	1
I	1
believe?	1
I	1
suppose	1
it's	1
very	1
interesting."	1
	1
"Very	1
interesting."	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
exchanged	1
glances	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
The	1
latter	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
to	1
entertain	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
sitting	1
down	1
beside	1
him	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
about	1
his	1
father;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
countess,	1
only	1
in	1
monosyllables.	1
The	1
other	1
guests	1
were	1
all	1
conversing	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
"The	1
Razumovskis...	1
It	1
was	1
charming...	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
kind...	1
Countess	1
Apraksina..."	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
The	1
countess	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna?"	1
came	1
her	1
voice	1
from	1
there.	1
	1
"Herself,"	1
came	1
the	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
rough	1
voice,	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
unmarried	1
ladies	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
married	1
ones	1
except	1
the	1
very	1
oldest	1
rose.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Tall	1
and	1
stout,	1
holding	1
high	1
her	1
fifty-year-old	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
curls,	1
she	1
stood	1
surveying	1
the	1
guests,	1
and	1
leisurely	1
arranged	1
her	1
wide	1
sleeves	1
as	1
if	1
rolling	1
them	1
up.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
spoke	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Health	1
and	1
happiness	1
to	1
her	1
whose	1
name	1
day	1
we	1
are	1
keeping	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
children,"	1
she	1
said,	1
in	1
her	1
loud,	1
full-toned	1
voice	1
which	1
drowned	1
all	1
others.	1
"Well,	1
you	1
old	1
sinner,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
kissing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"you're	1
feeling	1
dull	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
I	1
daresay?	1
Nowhere	1
to	1
hunt	1
with	1
your	1
dogs?	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
old	1
man?	1
Just	1
see	1
how	1
these	1
nestlings	1
are	1
growing	1
up,"	1
and	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
girls.	1
"You	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
husbands	1
for	1
them	1
whether	1
you	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not...."	1
	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"how's	1
my	1
Cossack?"	1
(Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
always	1
called	1
Natasha	1
a	1
Cossack)	1
and	1
she	1
stroked	1
the	1
child's	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
fearless	1
and	1
gay	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hand.	1
"I	1
know	1
she's	1
a	1
scamp	1
of	1
a	1
girl,	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
her."	1
	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
pear-shaped	1
ruby	1
earrings	1
from	1
her	1
huge	1
reticule	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
rosy	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
beamed	1
with	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
saint's-day	1
fete,	1
turned	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
eh,	1
friend!	1
Come	1
here	1
a	1
bit,"	1
said	1
she,	1
assuming	1
a	1
soft	1
high	1
tone	1
of	1
voice.	1
"Come	1
here,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
and	1
she	1
ominously	1
tucked	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
still	1
higher.	1
Pierre	1
approached,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
childlike	1
way	1
through	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come	1
nearer,	1
come	1
nearer,	1
friend!	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
favor,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
case	1
it's	1
my	1
evident	1
duty."	1
She	1
paused.	1
All	1
were	1
silent,	1
expectant	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
clearly	1
only	1
a	1
prelude.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
lad!	1
My	1
word!	1
A	1
fine	1
lad!...	1
His	1
father	1
lies	1
on	1
his	1
deathbed	1
and	1
he	1
amuses	1
himself	1
setting	1
a	1
policeman	1
astride	1
a	1
bear!	1
For	1
shame,	1
sir,	1
for	1
shame!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
if	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
war."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
table?"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
went	1
in	1
first	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
the	1
countess	1
followed	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
them	1
because	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
regiment;	1
then	1
came	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
Shinshin.	1
Berg	1
gave	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
Vera.	1
The	1
smiling	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Nicholas.	1
After	1
them	1
other	1
couples	1
followed,	1
filling	1
the	1
whole	1
dining	1
hall,	1
and	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses	1
followed	1
singly.	1
The	1
footmen	1
began	1
moving	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
the	1
band	1
struck	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
gallery,	1
and	1
the	1
guests	1
settled	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
places.	1
Then	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
household	1
band	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
forks,	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
visitors,	1
and	1
the	1
soft	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
footmen.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
sat	1
the	1
countess	1
with	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
on	1
her	1
left,	1
the	1
other	1
lady	1
visitors	1
were	1
farther	1
down.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
hussar	1
colonel	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
and	1
Shinshin	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
male	1
visitors	1
on	1
his	1
right.	1
Midway	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
table	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
sat	1
the	1
grownup	1
young	1
people:	1
Vera	1
beside	1
Berg,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
beside	1
Boris;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
children,	1
tutors,	1
and	1
governesses.	1
From	1
behind	1
the	1
crystal	1
decanters	1
and	1
fruit	1
vases,	1
the	1
count	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
her	1
tall	1
cap	1
with	1
its	1
light-blue	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
busily	1
filled	1
his	1
neighbors'	1
glasses,	1
not	1
neglecting	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
countess	1
in	1
turn,	1
without	1
omitting	1
her	1
duties	1
as	1
hostess,	1
threw	1
significant	1
glances	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
pineapples	1
at	1
her	1
husband	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
bald	1
head	1
seemed	1
by	1
their	1
redness	1
to	1
contrast	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
with	1
his	1
gray	1
hair.	1
At	1
the	1
ladies'	1
end	1
an	1
even	1
chatter	1
of	1
voices	1
was	1
heard	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
at	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
the	1
voices	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
louder,	1
especially	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
who,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
flushed,	1
ate	1
and	1
drank	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
the	1
count	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
pattern	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Berg	1
with	1
tender	1
smiles	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Vera	1
that	1
love	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
earthly	1
but	1
a	1
heavenly	1
feeling.	1
Boris	1
was	1
telling	1
his	1
new	1
friend	1
Pierre	1
who	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
and	1
exchanging	1
glances	1
with	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
opposite.	1
Pierre	1
spoke	1
little	1
but	1
examined	1
the	1
new	1
faces,	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
Of	1
the	1
two	1
soups	1
he	1
chose	1
turtle	1
with	1
savory	1
patties	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
game	1
without	1
omitting	1
a	1
single	1
dish	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wines.	1
These	1
latter	1
the	1
butler	1
thrust	1
mysteriously	1
forward,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin,	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
next	1
man's	1
shoulders	1
and	1
whispered:	1
"Dry	1
Madeira"...	1
"Hungarian"...	1
or	1
"Rhine	1
wine"	1
as	1
the	1
case	1
might	1
be.	1
Of	1
the	1
four	1
crystal	1
glasses	1
engraved	1
with	1
the	1
count's	1
monogram	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
his	1
plate,	1
Pierre	1
held	1
out	1
one	1
at	1
random	1
and	1
drank	1
with	1
enjoyment,	1
gazing	1
with	1
ever-	1
increasing	1
amiability	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
guests.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
Boris	1
as	1
girls	1
of	1
thirteen	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
boy	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
and	1
have	1
just	1
kissed	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
Sometimes	1
that	1
same	1
look	1
fell	1
on	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
that	1
funny	1
lively	1
little	1
girl's	1
look	1
made	1
him	1
inclined	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
knowing	1
why.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
sat	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
Sonya,	1
beside	1
Julie	1
Karagina,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
talking	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
involuntary	1
smile.	1
Sonya	1
wore	1
a	1
company	1
smile	1
but	1
was	1
evidently	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy;	1
now	1
she	1
turned	1
pale,	1
now	1
blushed	1
and	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
overhear	1
what	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Julie	1
were	1
saying	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
governess	1
kept	1
looking	1
round	1
uneasily	1
as	1
if	1
preparing	1
to	1
resent	1
any	1
slight	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
upon	1
the	1
children.	1
The	1
German	1
tutor	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
all	1
the	1
dishes,	1
wines,	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
dessert,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
full	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
to	1
his	1
people	1
in	1
Germany;	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
greatly	1
offended	1
when	1
the	1
butler	1
with	1
a	1
bottle	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
napkin	1
passed	1
him	1
by.	1
He	1
frowned,	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
of	1
that	1
wine,	1
but	1
was	1
mortified	1
because	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
understand	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
quench	1
his	1
thirst	1
or	1
from	1
greediness	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
it,	1
but	1
simply	1
from	1
a	1
conscientious	1
desire	1
for	1
knowledge.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
At	1
the	1
men's	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
the	1
talk	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
The	1
colonel	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
declaration	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
already	1
appeared	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
copy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
seen,	1
had	1
that	1
day	1
been	1
forwarded	1
by	1
courier	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
the	1
deuce	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte?"	1
remarked	1
Shinshin.	1
"He	1
has	1
stopped	1
Austria's	1
cackle	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
our	1
turn	1
next."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
tall,	1
plethoric	1
German,	1
evidently	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
and	1
patriotically	1
Russian.	1
He	1
resented	1
Shinshin's	1
remark.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
reasson,	1
my	1
goot	1
sir,"	1
said	1
he,	1
speaking	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent,	1
"for	1
the	1
reasson	1
zat	1
ze	1
Emperor	1
knows	1
zat.	1
He	1
declares	1
in	1
ze	1
manifessto	1

and	1
dignity	1
of	1
ze	1
Empire	1
as	1
vell	1
as	1
ze	1
sanctity	1
of	1
its	1
alliances..."	1
he	1
spoke	1
this	1
last	1
word	1
with	1
particular	1
emphasis	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
it	1
lay	1
the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
	1
Then	1
with	1
the	1
unerring	1
official	1
memory	1
that	1
characterized	1
him	1
he	1
repeated	1
from	1
the	1
opening	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
manifesto:	1
	1
...	1
and	1
the	1
wish,	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
sole	1
and	1
absolute	1
aim-	1
-to	1
establish	1
peace	1
in	1
Europe	1
on	1
firm	1
foundations--has	1
now	1
decided	1
him	1
to	1
despatch	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
abroad	1
and	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
new	1
condition	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
that	1
purpose.	1
	1
"Zat,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
is	1
vy..."	1
he	1
concluded,	1
drinking	1
a	1
tumbler	1
of	1
wine	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
looking	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
for	1
approval.	1
	1
"Connaissez-vous	1
le	1
Proverbe:	1
*	1
'Jerome,	1
Jerome,	1
do	1
not	1
roam,	1
but	1
turn	1
spindles	1
at	1
home!'?"	1
said	1
Shinshin,	1
puckering	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
smiling.	1
"Cela	1
nous	1
convient	1
a	1
merveille.*(2)	1
Suvorov	1
now--he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about;	1
yet	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
a	1
plate	1
couture,*(3)	1
and	1
where	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
find	1
Suvorovs	1
now?	1
Je	1
vous	1
demande	1

said	1
he,	1
continually	1
changing	1
from	1
French	1
to	1
Russian.	1
	1
	1
*Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
proverb?	1
	1
*(2)	1
That	1

	1
*(3)	1
Hollow.	1
	1
*(4)	1
I	1
just	1
ask	1

that.	1
	1
"Ve	1
must	1
vight	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
tr-r-op	1
of	1
our	1
plood!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel,	1
thumping	1
the	1
table;	1
"and	1
ve	1
must	1
tie	1
for	1
our	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
zen	1
all	1

pe	1

And	1
ve	1
must	1
discuss	1
it	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
po-o-ossible"...	1
he	1
dwelt	1
particularly	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
possible...	1
"as	1
po-o-ossible,"	1
he	1
ended,	1
again	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
"Zat	1
is	1
how	1
ve	1
old	1
hussars	1
look	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
zere's	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
how	1
do	1
you,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
hussar,	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
judge	1
of	1
it?"	1
he	1
added,	1
addressing	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
being	1
discussed	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
his	1
partner	1
with	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
intent	1
on	1
the	1
colonel.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
flaming	1
up,	1
turning	1
his	1
plate	1
round	1
and	1
moving	1
his	1
wineglasses	1
about	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
decision	1
and	1
desperation	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
facing	1
some	1
great	1
danger.	1
"I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
we	1
Russians	1
must	1
die	1
or	1
conquer,"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
conscious--as	1
were	1
others--after	1
the	1
words	1
were	1
uttered	1
that	1
his	1
remarks	1
were	1
too	1
enthusiastic	1
and	1
emphatic	1
for	1
the	1
occasion	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
awkward.	1
	1
"What	1
you	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
was	1
splendid!"	1
said	1
his	1
partner	1
Julie.	1
	1
Sonya	1
trembled	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
blushed	1
to	1
her	1
ears	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
and	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders	1
while	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
speaking.	1
	1
Pierre	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
colonel's	1
speech	1
and	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
	1
"That's	1
fine,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"The	1
young	1
man's	1
a	1
real	1
hussar!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel,	1
again	1
thumping	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
about	1
over	1
there?"	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
inquired	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
thumping	1
the	1
table	1
for?"	1
she	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
hussar,	1
"and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
exciting	1
yourself?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
French	1
are	1
here?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
ze	1
truce,"	1
replied	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
war,"	1
the	1
count	1
shouted	1
down	1
the	1
table.	1
"You	1
know	1
my	1
son's	1
going,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
My	1
son	1
is	1
going."	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
four	1
sons	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
don't	1
fret.	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
God's	1
hands.	1
You	1
may	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
bed	1
or	1
God	1
may	1
spare	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
battle,"	1
replied	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
deep	1
voice,	1
which	1
easily	1
carried	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"That's	1
true!"	1
	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
conversations	1
concentrated,	1
the	1
ladies'	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
and	1
the	1
men's	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
ask,"	1
Natasha's	1
little	1
brother	1
was	1
saying;	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
won't	1
ask!"	1
	1
"I	1
will,"	1
replied	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Her	1
face	1
suddenly	1
flushed	1
with	1
reckless	1
and	1
joyous	1
resolution.	1
She	1
half	1
rose,	1
by	1
a	1
glance	1
inviting	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite,	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
coming,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
mother:	1
	1
"Mamma!"	1
rang	1
out	1
the	1
clear	1
contralto	1
notes	1
of	1
her	1
childish	1
voice,	1
audible	1
the	1
whole	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
asked	1
the	1
countess,	1
startled;	1
but	1
seeing	1
by	1
her	1
daughter's	1
face	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
mischief,	1
she	1
shook	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
her	1
sternly	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
and	1
forbidding	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
hushed.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
and	1
Natasha's	1
voice	1
sounded	1
still	1
more	1
firm	1
and	1
resolute.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
tried	1
to	1
frown,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
shook	1
her	1
fat	1
finger.	1
	1
"Cossack!"	1
she	1
said	1
threateningly.	1
	1
Most	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
uncertain	1
how	1
to	1
regard	1
this	1
sally,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
"You	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
care!"	1
said	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
"Mamma!	1
What	1
sweets	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have?"	1
Natasha	1
again	1
cried	1
boldly,	1
with	1
saucy	1
gaiety,	1
confident	1
that	1
her	1
prank	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
good	1
part.	1
	1
Sonya	1
and	1
fat	1
little	1
Petya	1
doubled	1
up	1
with	1
laughter.	1
	1
"You	1
see!	1
I	1
have	1
asked,"	1
whispered	1
Natasha	1
to	1
her	1
little	1
brother	1
and	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
him	1
again.	1
	1
"Ice	1
pudding,	1
but	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
any,"	1
said	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
Natasha	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
braved	1
even	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
	1
"Marya	1
Dmitrievna!	1
What	1
kind	1
of	1
ice	1
pudding?	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
ice	1
cream."	1
	1
"Carrot	1
ices."	1
	1
"No!	1
What	1
kind,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna?	1
What	1
kind?"	1
she	1
almost	1
screamed;	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know!"	1
	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
joined	1
in.	1
Everyone	1
laughed,	1
not	1
at	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna's	1
answer	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
incredible	1
boldness	1
and	1
smartness	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
treat	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
in	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
Natasha	1
only	1
desisted	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
pineapple	1
ice.	1
Before	1
the	1
ices,	1
champagne	1
was	1
served	1
round.	1
The	1
band	1
again	1
struck	1
up,	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
countess	1
kissed,	1
and	1
the	1
guests,	1
leaving	1
their	1
seats,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
"congratulate"	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
reached	1
across	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
clink	1
glasses	1
with	1
the	1
count,	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
Again	1
the	1
footmen	1
rushed	1
about,	1
chairs	1
scraped,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
order	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
but	1
with	1
redder	1
faces,	1
the	1
guests	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
count's	1
study.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
The	1
card	1
tables	1
were	1
drawn	1
out,	1
sets	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
boston,	1
and	1
the	1
count's	1
visitors	1
settled	1
themselves,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
library.	1
	1
The	1
count,	1
holding	1
his	1
cards	1
fanwise,	1
kept	1
himself	1
with	1
difficulty	1
from	1
dropping	1
into	1
his	1
usual	1
after-dinner	1
nap,	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
everything.	1
The	1
young	1
people,	1
at	1
the	1
countess'	1
instigation,	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
clavichord	1
and	1
harp.	1
Julie	1
by	1
general	1
request	1
played	1
first.	1
After	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
a	1
little	1
air	1
with	1
variations	1
on	1
the	1
harp,	1
she	1
joined	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
begging	1
Natasha	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
were	1
noted	1
for	1
their	1
musical	1
talent,	1
to	1
sing	1
something.	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
was	1
treated	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
grown	1
up,	1
was	1
evidently	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
this	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
felt	1
shy.	1
	1
"What	1
shall	1
we	1
sing?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"'The	1
Brook,'"	1
suggested	1
Nicholas.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
let's	1
be	1
quick.	1
Boris,	1
come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"But	1
where	1
is	1
Sonya?"	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
Running	1
into	1
Sonya's	1
room	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
her	1
there,	1
Natasha	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
nursery,	1
but	1
Sonya	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
either.	1
Natasha	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage.	1
The	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
mourning	1
for	1
the	1
younger	1
female	1
generation	1
in	1
the	1
Rostov	1
household.	1
And	1
there	1
in	1
fact	1
was	1
Sonya	1
lying	1
face	1
downward	1
on	1
Nurse's	1
dirty	1
feather	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
chest,	1
crumpling	1
her	1
gauzy	1
pink	1
dress	1
under	1
her,	1
hiding	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
slender	1
fingers,	1
and	1
sobbing	1
so	1
convulsively	1
that	1
her	1
bare	1
little	1
shoulders	1
shook.	1
Natasha's	1
face,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
radiantly	1
happy	1
all	1
that	1
saint's	1
day,	1
suddenly	1
changed:	1
her	1
eyes	1
became	1
fixed,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
shiver	1
passed	1
down	1
her	1
broad	1
neck	1
and	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
mouth	1
drooped.	1
	1
"Sonya!	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter?...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...	1
Oo...!"	1
And	1
Natasha's	1
large	1
mouth	1
widened,	1
making	1
her	1
look	1
quite	1
ugly,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
wail	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
except	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
crying.	1
Sonya	1
tried	1
to	1
lift	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
answer	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
and	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
still	1
deeper	1
in	1
the	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
wept,	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
blue-striped	1
feather	1
bed	1
and	1
hugging	1
her	1
friend.	1
With	1
an	1
effort	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
wiping	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
explaining.	1
	1
"Nicholas	1
is	1
going	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time,	1
his...	1
papers...	1
have	1
come...	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
himself...	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,"	1
and	1
she	1
showed	1
a	1
paper	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand--with	1
the	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
had	1
written,	1
"still,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
cry,	1
but	1
you	1
can't...	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
understand...	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
he	1
has!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
again	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
noble	1
soul.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
you...	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
envious...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
and	1
Boris	1
also,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
gaining	1
a	1
little	1
strength;	1
"he	1
is	1
nice...	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
difficulties	1
in	1
your	1
way....	1
But	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
my	1
cousin...	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
to...	1
the	1
Metropolitan	1
himself...	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
done.	1
And	1
besides,	1
if	1
she	1
tells	1
Mamma"	1
(Sonya	1
looked	1
upon	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
called	1
her	1
so)	1
"that	1
I	1
am	1
spoiling	1
Nicholas'	1
career	1
and	1
am	1
heartless	1
and	1
ungrateful,	1
while	1
truly...	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,"	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross,	1
"I	1
love	1
her	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
only	1
Vera...	1
And	1
what	1
for?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
her?	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
sacrifice	1
everything,	1
only	1
I	1
have	1
nothing...."	1
	1
Sonya	1
could	1
not	1
continue,	1
and	1
again	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
feather	1
bed.	1
Natasha	1
began	1
consoling	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
gravity	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
trouble.	1
	1
"Sonya,"	1
she	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
guessed	1
the	1
true	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
friend's	1
sorrow,	1
"I'm	1
sure	1
Vera	1
has	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
you	1
since	1
dinner?	1
Hasn't	1
she?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
these	1
verses	1
Nicholas	1
wrote	1
himself	1
and	1
I	1
copied	1
some	1
others,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
them	1
on	1
my	1
table	1
and	1
said	1
she'd	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
Mamma,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
ungrateful,	1
and	1
that	1
Mamma	1
would	1
never	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
me,	1
but	1
that	1
he'll	1
marry	1
Julie.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
he's	1
been	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
day...	1
Natasha,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
deserve	1
it?..."	1
	1
And	1
again	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
sob,	1
more	1
bitterly	1
than	1
before.	1
Natasha	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
hugged	1
her,	1
and,	1
smiling	1
through	1
her	1
tears,	1
began	1
comforting	1
her.	1
	1
"Sonya,	1
don't	1
believe	1
her,	1
darling!	1
Don't	1
believe	1
her!	1
Do	1
you	1
remember	1
how	1
we	1
and	1
Nicholas,	1
all	1
three	1
of	1
us,	1
talked	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
after	1
supper?	1
Why,	1
we	1
settled	1
how	1
everything	1
was	1
to	1
be.	1
I	1
don't	1
quite	1
remember	1
how,	1
but	1
don't	1
you	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
all	1
be	1
arranged	1
and	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
all	1
was?	1
There's	1
Uncle	1
Shinshin's	1
brother	1
has	1
married	1
his	1
first	1
cousin.	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
second	1
cousins,	1
you	1
know.	1
And	1
Boris	1
says	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
possible.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
clever	1
and	1
so	1
good!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
cry,	1
Sonya,	1
dear	1
love,	1
darling	1
Sonya!"	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
her	1
and	1
laughed.	1
"Vera's	1
spiteful;	1
never	1
mind	1
her!	1
And	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
right	1
and	1
she	1
won't	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
Mamma.	1
Nicholas	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
doesn't	1
care	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
Julie."	1
	1
Natasha	1
kissed	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
hair.	1
	1
Sonya	1
sat	1
up.	1
The	1
little	1
kitten	1
brightened,	1
its	1
eyes	1
shone,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
lift	1
its	1
tail,	1
jump	1
down	1
on	1
its	1
soft	1
paws,	1
and	1
begin	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
worsted	1
as	1
a	1
kitten	1
should.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
so?...	1
Really?	1
Truly?"	1
she	1
said,	1
quickly	1
smoothing	1
her	1
frock	1
and	1
hair.	1
	1
"Really,	1
truly!"	1
answered	1
Natasha,	1
pushing	1
in	1
a	1
crisp	1
lock	1
that	1
had	1
strayed	1
from	1
under	1
her	1
friend's	1
plaits.	1
	1
Both	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
let's	1
go	1
and	1
sing	1
'The	1
Brook.'"	1
	1
"Come	1
along!"	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
fat	1
Pierre	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
me	1
is	1
so	1
funny!"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
stopping	1
suddenly.	1
"I	1
feel	1
so	1
happy!"	1
	1
And	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Sonya,	1
shaking	1
off	1
some	1
down	1
which	1
clung	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
tucking	1
away	1
the	1
verses	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
bony	1
little	1
chest,	1
ran	1
after	1
Natasha	1
down	1
the	1
passage	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
flushed	1
face	1
and	1
light,	1
joyous	1
steps.	1
At	1
the	1
visitors'	1
request	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
sang	1
the	1
quartette,	1
"The	1
Brook,"	1
with	1
which	1
everyone	1
was	1
delighted.	1
Then	1
Nicholas	1
sang	1
a	1
song	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
learned:	1
	1
	1
At	1
nighttime	1
in	1
the	1
moon's	1
fair	1
glow	1
How	1
sweet,	1
as	1
fancies	1
wander	1
free,	1
To	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there's	1
one	1
Who	1
still	1
is	1
thinking	1
but	1
of	1
thee!	1
	1
That	1
while	1
her	1
fingers	1
touch	1
the	1
harp	1
Wafting	1
sweet	1
music	1
o'er	1
the	1
lea,	1
It	1
is	1
for	1
thee	1
thus	1
swells	1
her	1
heart,	1
Sighing	1
its	1
message	1
out	1
to	1
thee...	1
	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
then	1
bliss	1
unspoilt,	1
But	1
oh!	1
till	1
then	1
I	1
cannot	1
live!...	1
	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
the	1
last	1
verse	1
before	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
hall,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
coughing	1
of	1
the	1
musicians	1
were	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
gallery.	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
where	1
Shinshin	1
had	1
engaged	1
him,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
recently	1
returned	1
from	1
abroad,	1
in	1
a	1
political	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
several	1
others	1
joined	1
but	1
which	1
bored	1
Pierre.	1
When	1
the	1
music	1
began	1
Natasha	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
walking	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
said,	1
laughing	1
and	1
blushing:	1
	1
"Mamma	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
dancers."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
mixing	1
the	1
figures,"	1
Pierre	1
replied;	1
"but	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
teacher..."	1
And	1
lowering	1
his	1
big	1
arm	1
he	1
offered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
slender	1
little	1
girl.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
couples	1
were	1
arranging	1
themselves	1
and	1
the	1
musicians	1
tuning	1
up,	1
Pierre	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
little	1
partner.	1
Natasha	1
was	1
perfectly	1
happy;	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
abroad.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
place	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
grown-up	1
lady.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
fan	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
hold.	1
Assuming	1
quite	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
a	1
society	1
woman	1
(heaven	1
knows	1
when	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
learned	1
it)	1
she	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
partner,	1
fanning	1
herself	1
and	1
smiling	1
over	1
the	1
fan.	1
	1
"Dear,	1
dear!	1
Just	1
look	1
at	1
her!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
countess	1
as	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
pointing	1
to	1
Natasha.	1
	1
Natasha	1
blushed	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Mamma!	1
Why	1
should	1
you?	1
What	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at?"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
ecossaise	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
clatter	1
of	1
chairs	1
being	1
pushed	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
had	1
been	1
playing	1
cards	1
with	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
distinguished	1
and	1
older	1
visitors.	1
They	1
now,	1
stretching	1
themselves	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long,	1
and	1
replacing	1
their	1
purses	1
and	1
pocketbooks,	1
entered	1
the	1
ballroom.	1
First	1
came	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
both	1
with	1
merry	1
countenances.	1
The	1
count,	1
with	1
playful	1
ceremony	1
somewhat	1
in	1
ballet	1
style,	1
offered	1
his	1
bent	1
arm	1
to	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
He	1
drew	1
himself	1
up,	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
debonair	1
gallantry	1
lit	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
ecossaise	1
was	1
ended,	1
he	1
clapped	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
and	1
shouted	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
gallery,	1
addressing	1
the	1
first	1
violin:	1
	1
"Semen!	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
Daniel	1
Cooper?"	1
	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
count's	1
favorite	1
dance,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
in	1
his	1
youth.	1
(Strictly	1
speaking,	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
was	1
one	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
anglaise.)	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
shouted	1
Natasha	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
company,	1
and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dancing	1
with	1
a	1
grown-up	1
partner	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
curly	1
head	1
to	1
her	1
knees	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
ring	1
with	1
her	1
laughter.	1
	1
And	1
indeed	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
jovial	1
old	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
standing	1
beside	1
his	1
tall	1
and	1
stout	1
partner,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
curved	1
his	1
arms,	1
beat	1
time,	1
straightened	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
turned	1
out	1
his	1
toes,	1
tapped	1
gently	1
with	1
his	1
foot,	1
and,	1
by	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
broadened	1
his	1
round	1
face	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
prepared	1
the	1
onlookers	1
for	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
follow.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
provocatively	1
gay	1
strains	1
of	1
Daniel	1
Cooper	1
(somewhat	1
resembling	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
peasant	1
dance)	1
began	1
to	1
sound,	1
all	1
the	1
doorways	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom	1
were	1
suddenly	1
filled	1
by	1
the	1
domestic	1
serfs--the	1
men	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
on	1
the	1
other--who	1
with	1
beaming	1
faces	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
master	1
making	1
merry.	1
	1
"Just	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
master!	1
A	1
regular	1
eagle	1
he	1
is!"	1
loudly	1
remarked	1
the	1
nurse,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
doorways.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
danced	1
well	1
and	1
knew	1
it.	1
But	1
his	1
partner	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
well.	1
Her	1
enormous	1
figure	1
stood	1
erect,	1
her	1
powerful	1
arms	1
hanging	1
down	1
(she	1
had	1
handed	1
her	1
reticule	1
to	1
the	1
countess),	1
and	1
only	1
her	1
stern	1
but	1
handsome	1
face	1
really	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
dance.	1
What	1
was	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
plump	1
figure,	1
in	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
found	1
expression	1
only	1
in	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
beaming	1
face	1
and	1
quivering	1
nose.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
count,	1
getting	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
into	1
the	1
swing	1
of	1
it,	1
charmed	1
the	1
spectators	1
by	1
the	1
unexpectedness	1
of	1
his	1
adroit	1
maneuvers	1
and	1
the	1
agility	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
capered	1
about	1
on	1
his	1
light	1
feet,	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna	1
produced	1
no	1
less	1
impression	1
by	1
slight	1
exertions--the	1
least	1
effort	1
to	1
move	1
her	1
shoulders	1
or	1
bend	1
her	1
arms	1
when	1
turning,	1
or	1
stamp	1
her	1
foot--	1
which	1
everyone	1
appreciated	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
her	1
size	1
and	1
habitual	1
severity.	1
The	1
dance	1
grew	1
livelier	1
and	1
livelier.	1
The	1
other	1
couples	1
could	1
not	1
attract	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
evolutions	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
All	1
were	1
watching	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna.	1
Natasha	1
kept	1
pulling	1
everyone	1
by	1
sleeve	1
or	1
dress,	1
urging	1
them	1
to	1
"look	1
at	1
Papa!"	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
never	1
took	1
their	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
couple.	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
the	1
dance	1
the	1
count,	1
breathing	1
deeply,	1
waved	1
and	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
to	1
play	1
faster.	1
Faster,	1
faster,	1
and	1
faster;	1
lightly,	1
more	1
lightly,	1
and	1
yet	1
more	1
lightly	1
whirled	1
the	1
count,	1
flying	1
round	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
toes,	1
now	1
on	1
his	1
heels;	1
until,	1
turning	1
his	1
partner	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
seat,	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
final	1
pas,	1
raising	1
his	1
soft	1
foot	1
backwards,	1
bowing	1
his	1
perspiring	1
head,	1
smiling	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
wide	1
sweep	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
amid	1
a	1
thunder	1
of	1
applause	1
and	1
laughter	1
led	1
by	1
Natasha.	1
Both	1
partners	1
stood	1
still,	1
breathing	1
heavily	1
and	1
wiping	1
their	1
faces	1
with	1
their	1
cambric	1
handkerchiefs.	1
	1
"That's	1
how	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
dance	1
in	1
our	1
time,	1
ma	1
chere,"	1
said	1
the	1
count.	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
Daniel	1
Cooper!"	1
exclaimed	1
Marya	1
Dmitrievna,	1
tucking	1
up	1
her	1
sleeves	1
and	1
puffing	1
heavily.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
While	1
in	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
ballroom	1
the	1
sixth	1
anglaise	1
was	1
being	1
danced,	1
to	1
a	1
tune	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
weary	1
musicians	1
blundered,	1
and	1
while	1
tired	1
footmen	1
and	1
cooks	1
were	1
getting	1
the	1
supper,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
had	1
a	1
sixth	1
stroke.	1
The	1
doctors	1
pronounced	1
recovery	1
impossible.	1
After	1
a	1
mute	1
confession,	1
communion	1
was	1
administered	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
preparations	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bustle	1
and	1
thrill	1
of	1
suspense	1
usual	1
at	1
such	1
moments.	1
Outside	1
the	1
house,	1
beyond	1
the	1
gates,	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
undertakers,	1
who	1
hid	1
whenever	1
a	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up,	1
waited	1
in	1
expectation	1
of	1
an	1
important	1
order	1
for	1
an	1
expensive	1
funeral.	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
of	1
Moscow,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
assiduous	1
in	1
sending	1
aides-de-camp	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
the	1
count's	1
health,	1
came	1
himself	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
bid	1
a	1
last	1
farewell	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
grandee	1
of	1
Catherine's	1
court,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov.	1
	1
The	1
magnificent	1
reception	1
room	1
was	1
crowded.	1
Everyone	1
stood	1
up	1
respectfully	1
when	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor,	1
having	1
stayed	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
passed	1
out,	1
slightly	1
acknowledging	1
their	1
bows	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
the	1
glances	1
fixed	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
doctors,	1
clergy,	1
and	1
relatives	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
had	1
grown	1
thinner	1
and	1
paler	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
days,	1
escorted	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
low	1
tones.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
Military	1
Governor	1
had	1
gone,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sat	1
down	1
all	1
alone	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
crossing	1
one	1
leg	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
his	1
knee	1
and	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
After	1
sitting	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
he	1
rose,	1
and,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
frightened	1
eyes,	1
went	1
with	1
unusually	1
hurried	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
corridor	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
	1
Those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
dimly	1
lit	1
reception	1
room	1
spoke	1
in	1
nervous	1
whispers,	1
and,	1
whenever	1
anyone	1
went	1
into	1
or	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
room,	1
grew	1
silent	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
curiosity	1
or	1
expectancy	1
at	1
his	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
slightly	1
when	1
opened.	1
	1
"The	1
limits	1
of	1
human	1
life...	1
are	1
fixed	1
and	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
o'erpassed,"	1
said	1
an	1
old	1
priest	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
listening	1
naively	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
"I	1
wonder,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
administer	1
unction?"	1
asked	1
the	1
lady,	1
adding	1
the	1
priest's	1
clerical	1
title,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
sacrament,"	1
replied	1
the	1
priest,	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
thin	1
grizzled	1
strands	1
of	1
hair	1
combed	1
back	1
across	1
his	1
bald	1
head.	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
that?	1
The	1
Military	1
Governor	1
himself?"	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
"How	1
young-looking	1
he	1
is!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
over	1
sixty.	1
I	1
hear	1
the	1
count	1
no	1
longer	1
recognizes	1
anyone.	1
They	1
wished	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
sacrament	1
of	1
unction."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
someone	1
who	1
received	1
that	1
sacrament	1
seven	1
times."	1
	1
The	1
second	1
princess	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
sickroom	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
red	1
from	1
weeping	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Dr.	1
Lorrain,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
a	1
graceful	1
pose	1
under	1
a	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine,	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
a	1
table.	1
	1
"Beautiful,"	1
said	1
the	1
doctor	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
remark	1
about	1
the	1
weather.	1
"The	1
weather	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
Princess;	1
and	1
besides,	1
in	1
Moscow	1
one	1
feels	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"So	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
drink?"	1
	1
Lorrain	1
considered.	1
	1
"Has	1
he	1
taken	1
his	1
medicine?"	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
glanced	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
	1
"Take	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
boiled	1
water	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
cream	1
of	1
tartar,"	1
and	1
he	1
indicated	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
a	1
pinch.	1
	1
"Dere	1
has	1
neffer	1
been	1
a	1
gase,"	1
a	1
German	1
doctor	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
an	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
"dat	1
one	1
liffs	1
after	1
de	1
sird	1
stroke."	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
well-preserved	1
man	1
he	1
was!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
"And	1
who	1
will	1
inherit	1
his	1
wealth?"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"It	1
von't	1
go	1
begging,"	1
replied	1
the	1
German	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
Everyone	1
again	1
looked	1
toward	1
the	1
door,	1
which	1
creaked	1
as	1
the	1
second	1
princess	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
drink	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
according	1
to	1
Lorrain's	1
instructions.	1
The	1
German	1
doctor	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Lorrain.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
can	1
last	1
till	1
morning?"	1
asked	1
the	1
German,	1
addressing	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
French	1
which	1
he	1
pronounced	1
badly.	1
	1
Lorrain,	1
pursing	1
up	1
his	1
lips,	1
waved	1
a	1
severely	1
negative	1
finger	1
before	1
his	1
nose.	1
	1
"Tonight,	1
not	1
later,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
decorous	1
smile	1
of	1
self-satisfaction	1
at	1
being	1
able	1
clearly	1
to	1
understand	1
and	1
state	1
the	1
patient's	1
condition.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
princess'	1
room.	1
	1
In	1
this	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
dark;	1
only	1
two	1
tiny	1
lamps	1
were	1
burning	1
before	1
the	1
icons	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
pleasant	1
scent	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
burnt	1
pastilles.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
crowded	1
with	1
small	1
pieces	1
of	1
furniture,	1
whatnots,	1
cupboards,	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
The	1
quilt	1
of	1
a	1
high,	1
white	1
feather	1
bed	1
was	1
just	1
visible	1
behind	1
a	1
screen.	1
A	1
small	1
dog	1
began	1
to	1
bark.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
is	1
it	1
you,	1
cousin?"	1
	1
She	1
rose	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
hair,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
usual	1
so	1
extremely	1
smooth	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
piece	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
varnish.	1
	1
"Has	1
anything	1
happened?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
"I	1
am	1
so	1
terrified."	1
	1
"No,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
change.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
about	1
business,	1
Catiche,"	1
*	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince,	1
seating	1
himself	1
wearily	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
vacated.	1
"You	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
place	1
warm,	1
I	1
must	1
say,"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
"Well,	1
sit	1
down:	1
let's	1
have	1
a	1
talk."	1
	1
	1
*Catherine.	1
	1
"I	1
thought	1
perhaps	1
something	1
had	1
happened,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
her	1
unchanging	1
stonily	1
severe	1
expression;	1
and,	1
sitting	1
down	1
opposite	1
the	1
prince,	1
she	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen.	1
	1
"I	1
wished	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
nap,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
but	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
bending	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
habit.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
"well?"	1
referred	1
to	1
much	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
understood	1
without	1
naming.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
straight,	1
rigid	1
body,	1
abnormally	1
long	1
for	1
her	1
legs,	1
looked	1
directly	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
emotion	1
in	1
her	1
prominent	1
gray	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
glanced	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
icons	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
This	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
devotion,	1
or	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
hope	1
of	1
resting	1
before	1
long.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
understood	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
weariness.	1
	1
"And	1
I?"	1
he	1
said;	1
"do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
me?	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
worn	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
post	1
horse,	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
you,	1
Catiche,	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
talk."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
and	1
his	1
cheeks	1
began	1
to	1
twitch	1
nervously,	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
giving	1
his	1
face	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
which	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
drawing	1
room.	1
His	1
eyes	1
too	1
seemed	1
strange;	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
they	1
looked	1
impudently	1
sly	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
glanced	1
round	1
in	1
alarm.	1
	1
The	1
princess,	1
holding	1
her	1
little	1
dog	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
with	1
her	1
thin	1
bony	1
hands,	1
looked	1
attentively	1
into	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
eyes	1
evidently	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
silence,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
morning.	1
	1
"Well,	1
you	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess	1
and	1
cousin,	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
theme,	1
apparently	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
inner	1
struggle;	1
"at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
this	1
one	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
everything.	1
One	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
you...	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
all,	1
like	1
children	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
as	1
you	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
moving,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
dull	1
expression.	1
	1
"And	1
then	1
of	1
course	1
my	1
family	1
has	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
considered,"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
went	1
on,	1
testily	1
pushing	1
away	1
a	1
little	1
table	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her.	1
"You	1
know,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
we--you	1
three	1
sisters,	1
Mamontov,	1
and	1
my	1
wife--	1
are	1
the	1
count's	1
only	1
direct	1
heirs.	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
easier	1
for	1
me;	1
but,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
sixty	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
anything.	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
Pierre?	1
The	1
count,"	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
portrait,	1
"definitely	1
demanded	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
called."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
the	1
princess,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
simply	1
looking	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
constantly	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
grant,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
allow	1
his	1
noble	1
soul	1
peacefully	1
to	1
leave	1
this..."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
of	1
course,"	1
interrupted	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
and	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
back	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
pushed	1
away.	1
"But...	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
fact	1
is...	1
you	1
know	1
yourself	1
that	1
last	1
winter	1
the	1
count	1
made	1
a	1
will	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
left	1
all	1
his	1
property,	1
not	1
to	1
us	1
his	1
direct	1
heirs,	1
but	1
to	1
Pierre."	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
made	1
wills	1
enough!"	1
quietly	1
remarked	1
the	1
princess.	1
"But	1
he	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
estate	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
Pierre	1
is	1
illegitimate."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
suddenly,	1
clutching	1
the	1
little	1
table	1
and	1
becoming	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
talking	1
more	1
rapidly:	1
"what	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
has	1
been	1
written	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
count	1
asks	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
legitimation?	1
Do	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
services,	1
his	1
request	1
would	1
be	1
granted?..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
smiled	1
as	1
people	1
do	1
who	1
think	1
they	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1
discussion	1
than	1
those	1
they	1
are	1
talking	1
with.	1
	1
"I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
more,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
seizing	1
her	1
hand,	1
"that	1
letter	1
was	1
written,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
sent,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
knew	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
is,	1
has	1
it	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not?	1
If	1
not,	1
then	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
is	1
over,"	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sighed	1
to	1
intimate	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
all	1
is	1
over,	1
"and	1
the	1
count's	1
papers	1
are	1
opened,	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
will	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
the	1
petition	1
will	1
certainly	1
be	1
granted.	1
Pierre	1
will	1
get	1
everything	1
as	1
the	1
legitimate	1
son."	1
	1
"And	1
our	1
share?"	1
asked	1
the	1
princess	1
smiling	1
ironically,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
might	1
happen,	1
only	1
not	1
that.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
poor	1
Catiche,	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
daylight!	1
He	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
the	1
legal	1
heir	1
to	1
everything	1
and	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
anything.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
whether	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
were	1
written,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
destroyed	1
or	1
not.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
somehow	1
been	1
overlooked,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
them,	1
because..."	1
	1
"What	1
next?"	1
the	1
princess	1
interrupted,	1
smiling	1
sardonically	1
and	1
not	1
changing	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
eyes.	1
"I	1
am	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
stupid;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
this:	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
son	1
cannot	1
inherit...	1
un	1
batard!"	1
*	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
supposing	1
that	1
this	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
would	1
effectively	1
prove	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
the	1
invalidity	1
of	1
his	1
contention.	1
	1
	1
*	1
A	1
bastard.	1
	1
"Well,	1
really,	1
Catiche!	1
Can't	1
you	1
understand!	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
intelligent,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
don't	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
count	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
recognize	1
Pierre	1
as	1
legitimate,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
Pierre	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
Pierre	1
but	1
will	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
will	1
then	1
inherit	1
everything	1
under	1
the	1
will?	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
will	1
and	1
letter	1
are	1
not	1
destroyed,	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
dutiful	1
et	1
tout	1
ce	1
qui	1
s'ensuit!	1
*	1
That's	1
certain."	1
	1
	1
*	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
follows	1
therefrom.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
the	1
will	1
was	1
made,	1
but	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
invalid;	1
and	1
you,	1
mon	1
cousin,	1
seem	1
to	1
consider	1
me	1
a	1
perfect	1
fool,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
women	1
assume	1
when	1
they	1
suppose	1
they	1
are	1
saying	1
something	1
witty	1
and	1
stinging.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
Princess	1
Catherine	1
Semenovna,"	1
began	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
impatiently,	1
"I	1
came	1
here	1
not	1
to	1
wrangle	1
with	1
you,	1
but	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
your	1
interests	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
kinswoman,	1
a	1
good,	1
kind,	1
true	1
relation.	1
And	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
tenth	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
in	1
Pierre's	1
favor	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
count's	1
papers,	1
then,	1
my	1
dear	1
girl,	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
sisters	1
are	1
not	1
heiresses!	1
If	1
you	1
don't	1
believe	1
me,	1
then	1
believe	1
an	1
expert.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
Dmitri	1
Onufrich"	1
(the	1
family	1
solicitor)	1
"and	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
At	1
this	1
a	1
sudden	1
change	1
evidently	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
princess'	1
ideas;	1
her	1
thin	1
lips	1
grew	1
white,	1
though	1
her	1
eyes	1
did	1
not	1
change,	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
passed	1
through	1
such	1
transitions	1
as	1
she	1
herself	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
expect.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
thing!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
never	1
wanted	1
anything	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
now."	1
	1
She	1
pushed	1
the	1
little	1
dog	1
off	1
her	1
lap	1
and	1
smoothed	1
her	1
dress.	1
	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
gratitude--this	1
is	1
recognition	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
his	1
sake!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"It's	1
splendid!	1
Fine!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
anything,	1
Prince."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
one.	1
There	1
are	1
your	1
sisters..."	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
long	1
ago	1
but	1
had	1
forgotten.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
expect	1
nothing	1
but	1
meanness,	1
deceit,	1
envy,	1
intrigue,	1
and	1
ingratitude--the	1
blackest	1
ingratitude--in	1
this	1
house..."	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
that	1
will	1
is?"	1
insisted	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
twitching	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fool!	1
I	1
still	1
believed	1
in	1
people,	1
loved	1
them,	1
and	1
sacrificed	1
myself.	1
But	1
only	1
the	1
base,	1
the	1
vile	1
succeed!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing!"	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
wished	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
the	1
prince	1
held	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
suddenly	1
lost	1
faith	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race.	1
She	1
gave	1
her	1
companion	1
an	1
angry	1
glance.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
my	1
dear.	1
You	1
must	1
remember,	1
Catiche,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
casually	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
anger,	1
of	1
illness,	1
and	1
was	1
afterwards	1
forgotten.	1
Our	1
duty,	1
my	1
dear,	1
is	1
to	1
rectify	1
his	1
mistake,	1
to	1
ease	1
his	1
last	1
moments	1
by	1
not	1
letting	1
him	1
commit	1
this	1
injustice,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
rendering	1
unhappy	1
those	1
who..."	1
	1
"Who	1
sacrificed	1
everything	1
for	1
him,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
the	1
princess,	1
who	1
would	1
again	1
have	1
risen	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
held	1
her	1
fast,	1
"though	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
appreciate	1
it.	1
No,	1
mon	1
cousin,"	1
she	1
added	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
"I	1
shall	1
always	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
must	1
expect	1
no	1
reward,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
honor	1
nor	1
justice.	1
In	1
this	1
world	1
one	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
cunning	1
and	1
cruel."	1
	1
"Now	1
come,	1
come!	1
Be	1
reasonable.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart."	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
wicked	1
heart."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
your	1
heart,"	1
repeated	1
the	1
prince.	1
"I	1
value	1
your	1
friendship	1
and	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
good	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
me.	1
Don't	1
upset	1
yourself,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
sensibly	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
time,	1
be	1
it	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
be	1
it	1
but	1
an	1
hour....	1
Tell	1
me	1
all	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
will,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
where	1
it	1
is.	1
You	1
must	1
know.	1
We	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
show	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
count.	1
He	1
has,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
forgotten	1
it	1
and	1
will	1
wish	1
to	1
destroy	1
it.	1
You	1
understand	1
that	1
my	1
sole	1
desire	1
is	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
wishes;	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
reason	1
for	1
being	1
here.	1
I	1
came	1
simply	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
and	1
you."	1
	1
"Now	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
all!	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
intriguing--I	1
know!"	1
cried	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"That's	1
not	1
the	1
point,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
"It's	1
that	1
protege	1
of	1
yours,	1
that	1
sweet	1
Princess	1
Drubetskaya,	1
that	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
whom	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
for	1
a	1
housemaid...	1
the	1
infamous,	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
	1
"Do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
lose	1
any	1
time..."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
don't	1
talk	1
to	1
me!	1
Last	1
winter	1
she	1
wheedled	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
count	1
such	1
vile,	1
disgraceful	1
things	1
about	1
us,	1
especially	1
about	1
Sophie--I	1
can't	1
repeat	1
them--that	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
count	1
quite	1
ill	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
see	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
fortnight.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
this	1
vile,	1
infamous	1
paper,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
invalid."	1
	1
"We've	1
got	1
to	1
it	1
at	1
last--why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it	1
sooner?"	1
	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
that	1
he	1
keeps	1
under	1
his	1
pillow,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
ignoring	1
his	1
question.	1
"Now	1
I	1
know!	1
Yes;	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
sin,	1
a	1
great	1
sin,	1
it	1
is	1
hatred	1
of	1
that	1
vile	1
woman!"	1
almost	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess,	1
now	1
quite	1
changed.	1
"And	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
come	1
worming	1
herself	1
in	1
here	1
for?	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
my	1
mind.	1
The	1
time	1
will	1
come!"	1

CHAPTER	1
XXII	1
	1
While	1
these	1
conversations	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
princess'	1
room,	1
a	1
carriage	1
containing	1
Pierre	1
(who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
for)	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
(who	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
accompany	1
him)	1
was	1
driving	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house.	1
As	1
the	1
wheels	1
rolled	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
straw	1
beneath	1
the	1
windows,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
having	1
turned	1
with	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
realized	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep	1
in	1
his	1
corner	1
and	1
woke	1
him	1
up.	1
Rousing	1
himself,	1
Pierre	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
only	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
interview	1
with	1
his	1
dying	1
father	1
which	1
awaited	1
him.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
entrance	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
door.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
steps	1
two	1
men,	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
tradespeople,	1
ran	1
hurriedly	1
from	1
the	1
entrance	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
wall.	1
Pausing	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
several	1
other	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
But	1
neither	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nor	1
the	1
footman	1
nor	1
the	1
coachman,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
these	1
people,	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
them.	1
"It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
right,"	1
Pierre	1
concluded,	1
and	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
She	1
hurriedly	1
ascended	1
the	1
narrow	1
dimly	1
lit	1
stone	1
staircase,	1
calling	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
was	1
lagging	1
behind,	1
to	1
follow.	1
Though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
all,	1
still	1
less	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
stairs,	1
yet	1
judging	1
by	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
air	1
of	1
assurance	1
and	1
haste,	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
absolutely	1
necessary.	1
Halfway	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
they	1
were	1
almost	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
who,	1
carrying	1
pails,	1
came	1
running	1
downstairs,	1
their	1
boots	1
clattering.	1
These	1
men	1
pressed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
to	1
let	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
pass	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
surprise	1
at	1
seeing	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
"Is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments?"	1
asked	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
a	1
footman	1
in	1
a	1
bold	1
loud	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
anything	1
were	1
now	1
permissible;	1
"the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
ma'am."	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
the	1
count	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
for	1
me,"	1
said	1
Pierre	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
landing.	1
"I'd	1
better	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
room."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
paused	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
she	1
said,	1
touching	1
his	1
arm	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
son's	1
when	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
afternoon,	1
"believe	1
me	1
I	1
suffer	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
you	1
do,	1
but	1
be	1
a	1
man!"	1
	1
"But	1
really,	1
hadn't	1
I	1
better	1
go	1
away?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
looking	1
kindly	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend!	1
Forget	1
the	1
wrongs	1
that	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
you.	1
Think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father...	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
agony	1
of	1
death."	1
She	1
sighed.	1
"I	1
have	1
loved	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
Trust	1
yourself	1
to	1
me,	1
Pierre.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
forget	1
your	1
interests."	1
	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
grew	1
stronger,	1
and	1
he	1
meekly	1
followed	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
opening	1
a	1
door.	1
	1
This	1
door	1
led	1
into	1
a	1
back	1
anteroom.	1
An	1
old	1
man,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
princesses,	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
knitting	1
a	1
stocking.	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
rooms.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
addressing	1
a	1
maid	1
who	1
was	1
hurrying	1
past	1
with	1
a	1
decanter	1
on	1
a	1
tray	1
as	1
"my	1
dear"	1
and	1
"my	1
sweet,"	1
asked	1
about	1
the	1
princess'	1
health	1
and	1
then	1
led	1
Pierre	1
along	1
a	1
stone	1
passage.	1
The	1
first	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
princesses'	1
apartments.	1
The	1
maid	1
with	1
the	1
decanter	1
in	1
her	1
haste	1
had	1
not	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
(everything	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
haste	1
at	1
that	1
time),	1
and	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
in	1
passing	1
instinctively	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
were	1
sitting	1
close	1
together	1
talking.	1
Seeing	1
them	1
pass,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
drew	1
back	1
with	1
obvious	1
impatience,	1
while	1
the	1
princess	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
desperation	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might.	1
	1
This	1
action	1
was	1
so	1
unlike	1
her	1
usual	1
composure	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
depicted	1
on	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
dignity	1
that	1
Pierre	1
stopped	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
evinced	1
no	1
surprise,	1
she	1
only	1
smiled	1
faintly	1
and	1
sighed,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
expected.	1
	1
"Be	1
a	1
man,	1
my	1
friend.	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
interests,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
look,	1
and	1
went	1
still	1
faster	1
along	1
the	1
passage.	1
	1
Pierre	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
what	1
"watching	1
over	1
his	1
interests"	1
meant,	1
but	1
he	1
decided	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
had	1
to	1
be.	1
From	1
the	1
passage	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
large,	1
dimly	1
lit	1
room	1
adjoining	1
the	1
count's	1
reception	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sumptuous	1
but	1
cold	1
apartments	1
known	1
to	1
Pierre	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
front	1
approach,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
there	1
now	1
stood	1
an	1
empty	1
bath,	1
and	1
water	1
had	1
been	1
spilled	1
on	1
the	1
carpet.	1
They	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
deacon	1
with	1
a	1
censer	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
passed	1
out	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
without	1
heeding	1
them.	1
They	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
familiar	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
with	1
two	1
Italian	1
windows	1
opening	1
into	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
with	1
its	1
large	1
bust	1
and	1
full	1
length	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great.	1
The	1
same	1
people	1
were	1
still	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
positions	1
as	1
before,	1
whispering	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
All	1
became	1
silent	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
pale	1
tear-worn	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
as	1
she	1
entered,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
big	1
stout	1
figure	1
of	1
Pierre	1
who,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head,	1
meekly	1
followed	1
her.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
face	1
expressed	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
the	1
decisive	1
moment	1
had	1
arrived.	1
With	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
Petersburg	1
lady	1
she	1
now,	1
keeping	1
Pierre	1
close	1
beside	1
her,	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
even	1
more	1
boldly	1
than	1
that	1
afternoon.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
as	1
she	1
brought	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
person	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
wished	1
to	1
see,	1
her	1
own	1
admission	1
was	1
assured.	1
Casting	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
at	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
noticing	1
the	1
count's	1
confessor	1
there,	1
she	1
glided	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
amble,	1
not	1
exactly	1
bowing	1
yet	1
seeming	1
to	1
grow	1
suddenly	1
smaller,	1
and	1
respectfully	1
received	1
the	1
blessing	1
first	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
another	1
priest.	1
	1
"God	1
be	1
thanked	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
time,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
priests;	1
"all	1
we	1
relatives	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
such	1
anxiety.	1
This	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son,"	1
she	1
added	1
more	1
softly.	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
moment!"	1
	1
Having	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
doctor.	1
	1
"Dear	1
doctor,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"this	1
young	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
count's	1
son.	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
hope?"	1
	1
The	1
doctor	1
cast	1
a	1
rapid	1
glance	1
upwards	1
and	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
movement	1
raised	1
her	1
shoulders	1
and	1
eyes,	1
almost	1
closing	1
the	1
latter,	1
sighed,	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
To	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
particularly	1
respectful	1
and	1
tenderly	1
sad	1
voice,	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"Trust	1
in	1
His	1
mercy!"	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
sofa	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
her,	1
she	1
went	1
silently	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
watching	1
and	1
it	1
creaked	1
very	1
slightly	1
as	1
she	1
disappeared	1
behind	1
it.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
monitress	1
implicitly,	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
sofa	1
she	1
had	1
indicated.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
had	1
disappeared	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
curiosity	1
and	1
sympathy.	1
He	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
casting	1
significant	1
looks	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
awe	1
and	1
even	1
servility.	1
A	1
deference	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
received	1
was	1
shown	1
him.	1
A	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
rose	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
her	1
seat;	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
picked	1
up	1
and	1
returned	1
a	1
glove	1
Pierre	1
had	1
dropped;	1
the	1
doctors	1
became	1
respectfully	1
silent	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him.	1
At	1
first	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
seat	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
trouble	1
the	1
lady,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
glove	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
pass	1
round	1
the	1
doctors	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
way;	1
but	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
and	1
that	1
tonight	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
obliged	1
to	1
perform	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
awful	1
rite	1
which	1
everyone	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
bound	1
to	1
accept	1
their	1
services.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
glove	1
in	1
silence	1
from	1
the	1
aide-de-	1
camp,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lady's	1
chair,	1
placing	1
his	1
huge	1
hands	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
in	1
the	1
naive	1
attitude	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
and	1
decided	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
do	1
foolish	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
act	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
ideas	1
tonight,	1
but	1
must	1
yield	1
himself	1
up	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
guiding	1
him.	1
	1
Not	1
two	1
minutes	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
head	1
erect	1
majestically	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
was	1
wearing	1
his	1
long	1
coat	1
with	1
three	1
stars	1
on	1
his	1
breast.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
thinner	1
since	1
the	1
morning;	1
his	1
eyes	1
seemed	1
larger	1
than	1
usual	1
when	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
and	1
noticed	1
Pierre.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
took	1
his	1
hand	1
(a	1
thing	1
he	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
do),	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
downwards	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
on.	1
	1
"Courage,	1
courage,	1
my	1
friend!	1
He	1
has	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
you.	1
That	1
is	1
well!"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
go.	1
	1
But	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
ask:	1
"How	1
is..."	1
and	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
"the	1
count,"	1
yet	1
ashamed	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
"father."	1
	1
"He	1
had	1
another	1
stroke	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago.	1
Courage,	1
my	1
friend..."	1
	1
Pierre's	1
mind	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
confused	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
"stroke"	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
blow	1
from	1
something.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
only	1
later	1
grasped	1
that	1
a	1
stroke	1
was	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
illness.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
tiptoe.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
walk	1
well	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
body	1
jerked	1
at	1
each	1
step.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
and	1
deacons	1
and	1
some	1
servants	1
also	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
Through	1
that	1
door	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
things	1
being	1
moved	1
about,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
still	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
pale	1
but	1
resolute	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
duty,	1
ran	1
out	1
and	1
touching	1
Pierre	1
lightly	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
said:	1
	1
"The	1
divine	1
mercy	1
is	1
inexhaustible!	1
Unction	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
administered.	1
Come."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
stepping	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
carpet,	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
strange	1
lady,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
all	1
followed	1
him	1
in,	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
now	1
no	1
further	1
need	1
for	1
permission	1
to	1
enter	1
that	1
room.	1
	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXIII	1
	1
Pierre	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
large	1
room	1
divided	1
by	1
columns	1
and	1
an	1
arch,	1
its	1
walls	1
hung	1
round	1
with	1
Persian	1
carpets.	1
The	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
behind	1
the	1
columns,	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
silk-curtained	1
mahogany	1
bedstead	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
an	1
immense	1
case	1
containing	1
icons,	1
was	1
brightly	1
illuminated	1
with	1
red	1
light	1
like	1
a	1
Russian	1
church	1
during	1
evening	1
service.	1
Under	1
the	1
gleaming	1
icons	1
stood	1
a	1
long	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
chair	1
on	1
snowy-	1
white	1
smooth	1
pillows,	1
evidently	1
freshly	1
changed,	1
Pierre	1
saw--covered	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
by	1
a	1
bright	1
green	1
quilt--the	1
familiar,	1
majestic	1
figure	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
with	1
that	1
gray	1
mane	1
of	1
hair	1
above	1
his	1
broad	1
forehead	1
which	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
characteristically	1
noble	1
wrinkles	1
of	1
his	1
handsome,	1
ruddy	1
face.	1
He	1
lay	1
just	1
under	1
the	1
icons;	1
his	1
large	1
thick	1
hands	1
outside	1
the	1
quilt.	1
Into	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
palm	1
downwards,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
had	1
been	1
thrust	1
between	1
forefinger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
servant,	1
bending	1
over	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
chair,	1
held	1
it	1
in	1
position.	1
By	1
the	1
chair	1
stood	1
the	1
priests,	1
their	1
long	1
hair	1
falling	1
over	1
their	1
magnificent	1
glittering	1
vestments,	1
with	1
lighted	1
tapers	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
conducting	1
the	1
service.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
them	1
stood	1
the	1
two	1
younger	1
princesses	1
holding	1
handkerchiefs	1
to	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
their	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
Catiche,	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
and	1
determined	1
look	1
steadily	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
icons,	1
as	1
though	1
declaring	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
for	1
herself	1
should	1
she	1
glance	1
round.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
a	1
meek,	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
all-forgiving	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
near	1
the	1
strange	1
lady.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
near	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair,	1
a	1
wax	1
taper	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand,	1
was	1
leaning	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
carved	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
velvet	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
was	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
upward	1
each	1
time	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
forehead.	1
His	1
face	1
wore	1
a	1
calm	1
look	1
of	1
piety	1
and	1
resignation	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
"If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
these	1
sentiments,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying,	1
"so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
you!"	1
	1
Behind	1
him	1
stood	1
the	1
aide-de-camp,	1
the	1
doctors,	1
and	1
the	1
menservants;	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
had	1
separated	1
as	1
in	1
church.	1
All	1
were	1
silently	1
crossing	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
service,	1
the	1
subdued	1
chanting	1
of	1
deep	1
bass	1
voices,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
sighs	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
feet	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
quite	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
about,	1
went	1
across	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
where	1
Pierre	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
taper.	1
He	1
lit	1
it	1
and,	1
distracted	1
by	1
observing	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
held	1
the	1
taper.	1
	1
Sophie,	1
the	1
rosy,	1
laughter-loving,	1
youngest	1
princess	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
watched	1
him.	1
She	1
smiled,	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
remained	1
with	1
it	1
hidden	1
for	1
awhile;	1
then	1
looking	1
up	1
and	1
seeing	1
Pierre	1
she	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
She	1
evidently	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
without	1
laughing,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
looking	1
at	1
him:	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
temptation	1
she	1
slipped	1
quietly	1
behind	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
suddenly	1
ceased,	1
they	1
whispered	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
count's	1
hand	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
stepped	1
forward	1
and,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
beckoned	1
to	1
Lorrain	1
from	1
behind	1
her	1
back.	1
The	1
French	1
doctor	1
held	1
no	1
taper;	1
he	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
columns	1
in	1
a	1
respectful	1
attitude	1
implying	1
that	1
he,	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
differences	1
of	1
faith,	1
understood	1
the	1
full	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
rite	1
now	1
being	1
performed	1
and	1
even	1
approved	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
now	1
approached	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
noiseless	1
step	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
full	1
vigor	1
of	1
life,	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
quilt	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
was	1
free,	1
and	1
turning	1
sideways	1
felt	1
the	1
pulse	1
and	1
reflected	1
a	1
moment.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
given	1
something	1
to	1
drink,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
stir	1
around	1
him,	1
then	1
the	1
people	1
resumed	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
continued.	1
During	1
this	1
interval	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
left	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
leaning,	1
and--with	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
intimated	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
and	1
if	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
them--did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
dying	1
man,	1
but	1
passed	1
by	1
him,	1
joined	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
and	1
moved	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
stood	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead	1
with	1
its	1
silken	1
hangings.	1
On	1
leaving	1
the	1
bed	1
both	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
passed	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
back	1
door,	1
but	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
places	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other	1
before	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
concluded.	1
Pierre	1
paid	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
occurrence	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on,	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
happening	1
around	1
him	1
that	1
evening	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
essential.	1
	1
The	1
chanting	1
of	1
the	1
service	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
priest	1
was	1
heard	1
respectfully	1
congratulating	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
on	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sacrament.	1
The	1
dying	1
man	1
lay	1
as	1
lifeless	1
and	1
immovable	1
as	1
before.	1
Around	1
him	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
stir:	1
steps	1
were	1
audible	1
and	1
whispers,	1
among	1
which	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
distinct.	1
	1
Pierre	1
heard	1
her	1
say:	1
	1
"Certainly	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
moved	1
onto	1
the	1
bed;	1
here	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible..."	1
	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
so	1
surrounded	1
by	1
doctors,	1
princesses,	1
and	1
servants	1
that	1
Pierre	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
see	1
the	1
reddish-yellow	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
mane--	1
which,	1
though	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
faces	1
as	1
well,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
moment	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
service.	1
He	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
cautious	1
movements	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
invalid	1
chair	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
the	1
dying	1
man	1
and	1
were	1
moving	1
him.	1
	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
or	1
you'll	1
drop	1
him!"	1
he	1
heard	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper.	1
"Catch	1
hold	1
from	1
underneath.	1
Here!"	1
exclaimed	1
different	1
voices;	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
breathing	1
of	1
the	1
bearers	1
and	1
the	1
shuffling	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
grew	1
more	1
hurried,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
weight	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
were	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
As	1
the	1
bearers,	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
passed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
momentary	1
glimpse	1
between	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
dying	1
man's	1
high,	1
stout,	1
uncovered	1
chest	1
and	1
powerful	1
shoulders,	1
raised	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
holding	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
armpits,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
gray,	1
curly,	1
leonine	1
head.	1
This	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
remarkably	1
broad	1
brow	1
and	1
cheekbones,	1
its	1
handsome,	1
sensual	1
mouth,	1
and	1
its	1
cold,	1
majestic	1
expression,	1
was	1
not	1
disfigured	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Pierre	1
remembered	1
it	1
three	1
months	1
before,	1
when	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
But	1
now	1
this	1
head	1
was	1
swaying	1
helplessly	1
with	1
the	1
uneven	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
bearers,	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
listless	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
itself	1
upon	1
nothing.	1
	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
bustle	1
beside	1
the	1
high	1
bedstead,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
dispersed.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
touched	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
and	1
said,	1
"Come."	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
stately	1
pose	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
ceremony	1
just	1
completed.	1
He	1
lay	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
propped	1
high	1
on	1
the	1
pillows.	1
His	1
hands	1
were	1
symmetrically	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
silk	1
quilt,	1
the	1
palms	1
downward.	1
When	1
Pierre	1
came	1
up	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
gazing	1
straight	1
at	1
him,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
by	1
mortal	1
man.	1
Either	1
this	1
look	1
meant	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
has	1
eyes	1
they	1
must	1
look	1
somewhere,	1
or	1
it	1
meant	1
too	1
much.	1
Pierre	1
hesitated,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
guide.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
made	1
a	1
hurried	1
sign	1
with	1
her	1
eyes,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
hand	1
and	1
moving	1
her	1
lips	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
a	1
kiss.	1
Pierre,	1
carefully	1
stretching	1
his	1
neck	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
quilt,	1
followed	1
her	1
suggestion	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
boned,	1
fleshy	1
hand.	1
Neither	1
the	1
hand	1
nor	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
stirred.	1
Once	1
more	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
questioningly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
next.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
indicated	1
a	1
chair	1
that	1
stood	1
beside	1
the	1
bed.	1
Pierre	1
obediently	1
sat	1
down,	1
his	1
eyes	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
doing	1
right.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
nodded	1
approvingly.	1
Again	1
Pierre	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
naively	1
symmetrical	1
pose	1
of	1
an	1
Egyptian	1
statue,	1
evidently	1
distressed	1
that	1
his	1
stout	1
and	1
clumsy	1
body	1
took	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
room	1
and	1
doing	1
his	1
utmost	1
to	1
look	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
possible.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
count,	1
who	1
still	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Pierre's	1
face	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
he	1
sat	1
down.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
indicated	1
by	1
her	1
attitude	1
her	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
pathetic	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
moments	1
of	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
son.	1
This	1
lasted	1
about	1
two	1
minutes,	1
which	1
to	1
Pierre	1
seemed	1
an	1
hour.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
broad	1
muscles	1
and	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
count's	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
twitch.	1
The	1
twitching	1
increased,	1
the	1
handsome	1
mouth	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
(only	1
now	1
did	1
Pierre	1
realize	1
how	1
near	1
death	1
his	1
father	1
was),	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
distorted	1
mouth	1
issued	1
an	1
indistinct,	1
hoarse	1
sound.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
looked	1
attentively	1
at	1
the	1
sick	1
man's	1
eyes,	1
trying	1
to	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
wanted;	1
she	1
pointed	1
first	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
then	1
to	1
some	1
drink,	1
then	1
named	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
an	1
inquiring	1
whisper,	1
then	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
quilt.	1
The	1
eyes	1
and	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
showed	1
impatience.	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
stood	1
constantly	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
"Wants	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
servant,	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
count's	1
heavy	1
body	1
toward	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
to	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
being	1
turned	1
over,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
arms	1
fell	1
back	1
helplessly	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
fruitless	1
effort	1
to	1
pull	1
it	1
forward.	1
Whether	1
he	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
terror	1
with	1
which	1
Pierre	1
regarded	1
that	1
lifeless	1
arm,	1
or	1
whether	1
some	1
other	1
thought	1
flitted	1
across	1
his	1
dying	1
brain,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
refractory	1
arm,	1
at	1
Pierre's	1
terror-stricken	1
face,	1
and	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
a	1
feeble,	1
piteous	1
smile	1
appeared,	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
keeping	1
with	1
his	1
features,	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
deride	1
his	1
own	1
helplessness.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
smile	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
an	1
unexpected	1
quivering	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
a	1
tickling	1
in	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
tears	1
dimmed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
The	1
sick	1
man	1
was	1
turned	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
He	1
sighed.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
dozing,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
observing	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
princesses	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
turn	1
at	1
watching.	1
"Let	1
us	1
go."	1
	1
Pierre	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XXIV	1
	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
except	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
who	1
were	1
sitting	1
under	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
Catherine	1
the	1
Great	1
and	1
talking	1
eagerly.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
Pierre	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
they	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
princess	1
hide	1
something	1
as	1
she	1
whispered:	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
woman."	1
	1
"Catiche	1
has	1
had	1
tea	1
served	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
"Go	1
and	1
take	1
something,	1
my	1
poor	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
out."	1
	1
To	1
Pierre	1
he	1
said	1
nothing,	1
merely	1
giving	1
his	1
arm	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
squeeze	1
below	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
Pierre	1
went	1
with	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
into	1
the	1
small	1
drawing	1
room.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
refreshing	1
after	1
a	1
sleepless	1
night	1
as	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
this	1
delicious	1
Russian	1
tea,"	1
Lorrain	1
was	1
saying	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
restrained	1
animation	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
sipping	1
tea	1
from	1
a	1
delicate	1
Chinese	1
handleless	1
cup	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
tea	1
and	1
a	1
cold	1
supper	1
were	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
circular	1
room.	1
Around	1
the	1
table	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
house	1
that	1
night	1
had	1
gathered	1
to	1
fortify	1
themselves.	1
Pierre	1
well	1
remembered	1
this	1
small	1
circular	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
its	1
mirrors	1
and	1
little	1
tables.	1
During	1
balls	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
dance,	1
had	1
liked	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
room	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
ladies	1
who,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
in	1
their	1
ball	1
dresses	1
with	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls	1
on	1
their	1
bare	1
shoulders,	1
looked	1
at	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
brilliantly	1
lighted	1
mirrors	1
which	1
repeated	1
their	1
reflections	1
several	1
times.	1
Now	1
this	1
same	1
room	1
was	1
dimly	1
lighted	1
by	1
two	1
candles.	1
On	1
one	1
small	1
table	1
tea	1
things	1
and	1
supper	1
dishes	1
stood	1
in	1
disorder,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
a	1
motley	1
throng	1
of	1
people	1
sat	1
there,	1
not	1
merrymaking,	1
but	1
somberly	1
whispering,	1
and	1
betraying	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
that	1
they	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
forgot	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
much	1
have	1
liked	1
to.	1
He	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
his	1
monitress	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
going	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess.	1
Pierre	1
concluded	1
that	1
this	1
also	1
was	1
essential,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interval	1
followed	1
her.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
standing	1
beside	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
speaking	1
in	1
excited	1
whispers.	1
	1
"Permit	1
me,	1
Princess,	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
necessary	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
necessary,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
speakers,	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
excitement	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
slammed	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
her	1
room.	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
answered	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
blandly	1
but	1
impressively,	1
blocking	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
bedroom	1
and	1
preventing	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
passing,	1
"won't	1
this	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
poor	1
Uncle	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
needs	1
repose?	1
Worldly	1
conversation	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
is	1
already	1
prepared..."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
in	1
his	1
familiar	1
attitude,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
crossed	1
high	1
above	1
the	1
other.	1
His	1
cheeks,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
flabby	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
heavier	1
below,	1
were	1
twitching	1
violently;	1
but	1
he	1
wore	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
little	1
concerned	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"Come,	1
my	1
dear	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
let	1
Catiche	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
pleases.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
count	1
is	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
even	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
paper,"	1
said	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
an	1
inlaid	1
portfolio	1
she	1
held	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
"All	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
his	1
real	1
will	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
paper	1
he	1
has	1
forgotten...."	1
	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
pass	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
sprang	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bar	1
her	1
path.	1
	1
"I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear,	1
kind	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
seizing	1
the	1
portfolio	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
easily.	1
"Dear	1
princess,	1
I	1
beg	1
and	1
implore	1
you,	1
have	1
some	1
pity	1
on	1
him!	1
Je	1
vous	1
en	1
conjure..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
Their	1
efforts	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
portfolio	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
audible,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
princess	1
did	1
speak,	1
her	1
words	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
flattering	1
to	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
Though	1
the	1
latter	1
held	1
on	1
tenaciously,	1
her	1
voice	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
honeyed	1
firmness	1
and	1
softness.	1
	1
"Pierre,	1
my	1
dear,	1
come	1
here.	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
consultation;	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
Prince?"	1
	1
"Why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak,	1
cousin?"	1
suddenly	1
shrieked	1
the	1
princess	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
heard	1
her	1
and	1
were	1
startled.	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
remain	1
silent	1
when	1
heaven	1
knows	1
who	1
permits	1
herself	1
to	1
interfere,	1
making	1
a	1
scene	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
threshold	1
of	1
a	1
dying	1
man's	1
room?	1
Intriguer!"	1
she	1
hissed	1
viciously,	1
and	1
tugged	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
at	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
step	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
hold	1
on	1
the	1
portfolio,	1
and	1
changed	1
her	1
grip.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rose.	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
reproach	1
and	1
surprise,	1
"this	1
is	1
absurd!	1
Come,	1
let	1
go	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
let	1
go.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
too!"	1
	1
But	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
did	1
not	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
"Let	1
go,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
responsibility.	1
I	1
myself	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
ask	1
him,	1
I!...	1
does	1
that	1
satisfy	1
you?"	1
	1
"But,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
"after	1
such	1
a	1
solemn	1
sacrament,	1
allow	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
peace!	1
Here,	1
Pierre,	1
tell	1
them	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
said	1
she,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
having	1
come	1
quite	1
close,	1
was	1
gazing	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
angry	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
princess	1
which	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
dignity,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
twitching	1
cheeks	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Remember	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
the	1
consequences,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
severely.	1
"You	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing."	1
	1
"Vile	1
woman!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
princess,	1
darting	1
unexpectedly	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and	1
snatching	1
the	1
portfolio	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
terrible	1
door,	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
watched	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
opened	1
so	1
quietly,	1
burst	1
noisily	1
open	1
and	1
banged	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
sisters	1
rushed	1
out	1
wringing	1
her	1
hands.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
you	1
doing!"	1
she	1
cried	1
vehemently.	1
"He	1
is	1
dying	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
him!"	1
	1
Her	1
sister	1
dropped	1
the	1
portfolio.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
stooping,	1
quickly	1
caught	1
up	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
contention	1
and	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
The	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
recovering	1
themselves,	1
followed	1
her.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
eldest	1
sister	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
hard	1
face,	1
again	1
biting	1
her	1
underlip.	1
At	1
sight	1
of	1
Pierre	1
her	1
expression	1
showed	1
an	1
irrepressible	1
hatred.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
now	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
glad!"	1
said	1
she;	1
"this	1
is	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
waiting	1
for."	1
And	1
bursting	1
into	1
tears	1
she	1
hid	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
rushed	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
next.	1
He	1
staggered	1
to	1
the	1
sofa	1
on	1
which	1
Pierre	1
was	1
sitting	1
and	1
dropped	1
onto	1
it,	1
covering	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
jaw	1
quivered	1
and	1
shook	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
an	1
ague.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
Pierre	1
by	1
the	1
elbow;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
a	1
sincerity	1
and	1
weakness	1
Pierre	1
had	1
never	1
observed	1
in	1
it	1
before.	1
"How	1
often	1
we	1
sin,	1
how	1
much	1
we	1
deceive,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
what?	1
I	1
am	1
near	1
sixty,	1
dear	1
friend...	1
I	1
too...	1
All	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
death,	1
all!	1
Death	1
is	1
awful..."	1
and	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
came	1
out	1
last.	1
She	1
approached	1
Pierre	1
with	1
slow,	1
quiet	1
steps.	1
	1
"Pierre!"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
Pierre	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
She	1
kissed	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
wetting	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
tears.	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
she	1
said:	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
no	1
more...."	1
	1
Pierre	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
over	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
"Come,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you.	1
Try	1
to	1
weep,	1
nothing	1
gives	1
such	1
relief	1
as	1
tears."	1
	1
She	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
Pierre	1
was	1
glad	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
face.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
returned	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre:	1
	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
dear,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
you.	1
But	1
God	1
will	1
support	1
you:	1
you	1
are	1
young,	1
and	1
are	1
now,	1
I	1
hope,	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
fortune.	1
The	1
will	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
opened.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
your	1
head,	1
but	1
it	1
imposes	1
duties	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
Pierre	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"Perhaps	1
later	1
on	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
there,	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
happened!	1
You	1
know,	1
Uncle	1
promised	1
me	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
Boris.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time.	1
I	1
hope,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
will	1
carry	1
out	1
your	1
father's	1
wish?"	1
	1
Pierre	1
understood	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
coloring	1
shyly	1
looked	1
in	1
silence	1
at	1
Princess	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna.	1
After	1
her	1
talk	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
On	1
waking	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
she	1
told	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death.	1
She	1
said	1
the	1
count	1
had	1
died	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
herself	1
wish	1
to	1
die,	1
that	1
his	1
end	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
touching	1
but	1
edifying.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
meeting	1
between	1
father	1
and	1
son,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
touching	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
had	1
behaved	1
better	1
during	1
those	1
awful	1
moments--the	1
father	1
who	1
so	1
remembered	1
everything	1
and	1
everybody	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
pathetic	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
son,	1
or	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pitiful	1
to	1
see,	1
so	1
stricken	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
grief,	1
though	1
he	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
not	1
to	1
sadden	1
his	1
dying	1
father.	1
"It	1
is	1
painful,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
one	1
good.	1
It	1
uplifts	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
and	1
his	1
worthy	1
son,"	1
said	1
she.	1
Of	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
she	1
spoke	1
disapprovingly,	1
but	1
in	1
whispers	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
secret.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXV	1
	1
At	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
Bolkonski's	1
estate,	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
young	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
daily	1
expected,	1
but	1
this	1
expectation	1
did	1
not	1
upset	1
the	1
regular	1
routine	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
household.	1
General	1
in	1
Chief	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Andreevich	1
(nicknamed	1
in	1
society,	1
"the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia")	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Paul	1
had	1
exiled	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
country	1
estate	1
had	1
lived	1
there	1
continuously	1
with	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
her	1
companion,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
Though	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
reign	1
he	1
was	1
free	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
capitals,	1
he	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
remarking	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
could	1
come	1
the	1
hundred	1
miles	1
from	1
Moscow	1
to	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
needed	1
no	1
one	1
and	1
nothing.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
sources	1
of	1
human	1
vice--idleness	1
and	1
superstition,	1
and	1
only	1
two	1
virtues--activity	1
and	1
intelligence.	1
He	1
himself	1
undertook	1
his	1
daughter's	1
education,	1
and	1
to	1
develop	1
these	1
two	1
cardinal	1
virtues	1
in	1
her	1
gave	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
algebra	1
and	1
geometry	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
twenty,	1
and	1
arranged	1
her	1
life	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
time	1
was	1
occupied.	1
He	1
was	1
himself	1
always	1
occupied:	1
writing	1
his	1
memoirs,	1
solving	1
problems	1
in	1
higher	1
mathematics,	1
turning	1
snuffboxes	1
on	1
a	1
lathe,	1
working	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
or	1
superintending	1
the	1
building	1
that	1
was	1
always	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
his	1
estate.	1
As	1
regularity	1
is	1
a	1
prime	1
condition	1
facilitating	1
activity,	1
regularity	1
in	1
his	1
household	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
exactitude.	1
He	1
always	1
came	1
to	1
table	1
under	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
conditions,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
minute.	1
With	1
those	1
about	1
him,	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
to	1
his	1
serfs,	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sharp	1
and	1
invariably	1
exacting,	1
so	1
that	1
without	1
being	1
a	1
hardhearted	1
man	1
he	1
inspired	1
such	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
as	1
few	1
hardhearted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
aroused.	1
Although	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
retirement	1
and	1
had	1
now	1
no	1
influence	1
in	1
political	1
affairs,	1
every	1
high	1
official	1
appointed	1
to	1
the	1
province	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
prince's	1
estate	1
lay	1
considered	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
lofty	1
antechamber	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
architect,	1
gardener,	1
or	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did,	1
till	1
the	1
prince	1
appeared	1
punctually	1
to	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour.	1
Everyone	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
antechamber	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
of	1
respect	1
and	1
even	1
fear	1
when	1
the	1
enormously	1
high	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
rather	1
small	1
old	1
man,	1
with	1
powdered	1
wig,	1
small	1
withered	1
hands,	1
and	1
bushy	1
gray	1
eyebrows	1
which,	1
when	1
he	1
frowned,	1
sometimes	1
hid	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
his	1
shrewd,	1
youthfully	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
were	1
to	1
arrive,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered	1
the	1
antechamber	1
as	1
usual	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
for	1
the	1
morning	1
greeting,	1
crossing	1
herself	1
with	1
trepidation	1
and	1
repeating	1
a	1
silent	1
prayer.	1
Every	1
morning	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
like	1
that,	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
prayed	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
interview	1
might	1
pass	1
off	1
well.	1
	1
An	1
old	1
powdered	1
manservant	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
antechamber	1
rose	1
quietly	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"Please	1
walk	1
in."	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
regular	1
hum	1
of	1
a	1
lathe.	1
The	1
princess	1
timidly	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
which	1
moved	1
noiselessly	1
and	1
easily.	1
She	1
paused	1
at	1
the	1
entrance.	1
The	1
prince	1
was	1
working	1
at	1
the	1
lathe	1
and	1
after	1
glancing	1
round	1
continued	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
The	1
enormous	1
study	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
things	1
evidently	1
in	1
constant	1
use.	1
The	1
large	1
table	1
covered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
plans,	1
the	1
tall	1
glass-fronted	1
bookcases	1
with	1
keys	1
in	1
the	1
locks,	1
the	1
high	1
desk	1
for	1
writing	1
while	1
standing	1
up,	1
on	1
which	1
lay	1
an	1
open	1
exercise	1
book,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe	1
with	1
tools	1
laid	1
ready	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
shavings	1
scattered	1
around--all	1
indicated	1
continuous,	1
varied,	1
and	1
orderly	1
activity.	1
The	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
foot	1
shod	1
in	1
a	1
Tartar	1
boot	1
embroidered	1
with	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
firm	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
lean	1
sinewy	1
hand,	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
still	1
possessed	1
the	1
tenacious	1
endurance	1
and	1
vigor	1
of	1
hardy	1
old	1
age.	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
more	1
turns	1
of	1
the	1
lathe	1
he	1
removed	1
his	1
foot	1
from	1
the	1
pedal,	1
wiped	1
his	1
chisel,	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
leather	1
pouch	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and,	1
approaching	1
the	1
table,	1
summoned	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
never	1
gave	1
his	1
children	1
a	1
blessing,	1
so	1
he	1
simply	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
bristly	1
cheek	1
(as	1
yet	1
unshaven)	1
and,	1
regarding	1
her	1
tenderly	1
and	1
attentively,	1
said	1
severely:	1
	1
"Quite	1
well?	1
All	1
right	1
then,	1
sit	1
down."	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
written	1
by	1
himself	1
and	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
foot.	1
	1
"For	1
tomorrow!"	1
said	1
he,	1
quickly	1
finding	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
scratch	1
from	1
one	1
paragraph	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
his	1
hard	1
nail.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
here's	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
suddenly,	1
taking	1
a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
a	1
woman's	1
hand	1
from	1
a	1
bag	1
hanging	1
above	1
the	1
table,	1
onto	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
it.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
red	1
patches	1
showed	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
princess'	1
face.	1
She	1
took	1
it	1
quickly	1
and	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
it.	1
	1
"From	1
Heloise?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
a	1
cold	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
still	1
sound,	1
yellowish	1
teeth.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
from	1
Julie,"	1
replied	1
the	1
princess	1
with	1
a	1
timid	1
glance	1
and	1
a	1
timid	1
smile.	1
	1
"I'll	1
let	1
two	1
more	1
letters	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
I'll	1
read,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
sternly;	1
"I'm	1
afraid	1
you	1
write	1
much	1
nonsense.	1
I'll	1
read	1
the	1
third!"	1
	1
"Read	1
this	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
blushing	1
still	1
more	1
and	1
holding	1
out	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"The	1
third,	1
I	1
said	1
the	1
third!"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince	1
abruptly,	1
pushing	1
the	1
letter	1
away,	1
and	1
leaning	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
he	1
drew	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
containing	1
geometrical	1
figures.	1
	1
"Well,	1
madam,"	1
he	1
began,	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
book	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
placing	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
sat,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
surrounded	1
on	1
all	1
sides	1
by	1
the	1
acrid	1
scent	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
and	1
tobacco,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
so	1
long.	1
"Now,	1
madam,	1
these	1
triangles	1
are	1
equal;	1
please	1
note	1
that	1
the	1
angle	1
ABC..."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
scared	1
way	1
at	1
her	1
father's	1
eyes	1
glittering	1
close	1
to	1
her;	1
the	1
red	1
patches	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
came	1
and	1
went,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
nothing	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
that	1
her	1
fear	1
would	1
prevent	1
her	1
understanding	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
further	1
explanations,	1
however	1
clear	1
they	1
might	1
be.	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
teacher's	1
fault	1
or	1
the	1
pupil's,	1
this	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
every	1
day:	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
anything,	1
but	1
was	1
only	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
stern	1
father's	1
withered	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her,	1
of	1
his	1
breath	1
and	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
problem	1
in	1
peace.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
beside	1
himself:	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
noisily	1
backward	1
and	1
forward,	1
made	1
efforts	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
become	1
vehement,	1
but	1
almost	1
always	1
did	1
become	1
vehement,	1
scolded,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
flung	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
gave	1
a	1
wrong	1
answer.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
isn't	1
she	1
a	1
fool!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
pushing	1
the	1
book	1
aside	1
and	1
turning	1
sharply	1
away;	1
but	1
rising	1
immediately,	1
he	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
lightly	1
touched	1
his	1
daughter's	1
hair	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again.	1
	1
He	1
drew	1
up	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
explain.	1
	1
"This	1
won't	1
do,	1
Princess;	1
it	1
won't	1
do,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
having	1
taken	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
exercise	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
lesson,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
leave:	1
"Mathematics	1
are	1
most	1
important,	1
madam!	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
like	1
our	1
silly	1
ladies.	1
Get	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
you'll	1
like	1
it,"	1
and	1
he	1
patted	1
her	1
cheek.	1
"It	1
will	1
drive	1
all	1
the	1
nonsense	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
head."	1
	1
She	1
turned	1
to	1
go,	1
but	1
he	1
stopped	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
and	1
took	1
an	1
uncut	1
book	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
desk.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
Key	1
to	1
the	1
Mysteries	1
that	1
your	1
Heloise	1
has	1
sent	1
you.	1
Religious!	1
I	1
don't	1
interfere	1
with	1
anyone's	1
belief...	1
I	1
have	1
looked	1
at	1
it.	1
Take	1
it.	1
Well,	1
now	1
go.	1
Go."	1
	1
He	1
patted	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
himself	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
her.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
sad,	1
scared	1
expression	1
that	1
rarely	1
left	1
her	1
and	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
plain,	1
sickly	1
face	1
yet	1
plainer.	1
She	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
her	1
writing	1
table,	1
on	1
which	1
stood	1
miniature	1
portraits	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
littered	1
with	1
books	1
and	1
papers.	1
The	1
princess	1
was	1
as	1
untidy	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
tidy.	1
She	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
geometry	1
book	1
and	1
eagerly	1
broke	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
her	1
letter.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
her	1
most	1
intimate	1
friend	1
from	1
childhood;	1
that	1
same	1
Julie	1
Karagina	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
Rostovs'	1
name-	1
day	1
party.	1
	1
Julie	1
wrote	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
How	1
terrible	1
and	1
frightful	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
separation!	1
Though	1
I	1
tell	1
myself	1
that	1
half	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
half	1
my	1
happiness	1
are	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
distance	1
separating	1
us	1
our	1
hearts	1
are	1
united	1
by	1
indissoluble	1
bonds,	1
my	1
heart	1
rebels	1
against	1
fate	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
distractions	1
around	1
me	1
I	1
cannot	1
overcome	1
a	1
certain	1
secret	1
sorrow	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
ever	1
since	1
we	1
parted.	1
Why	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
together	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
last	1
summer,	1
in	1
your	1
big	1
study,	1
on	1
the	1
blue	1
sofa,	1
the	1
confidential	1
sofa?	1
Why	1
cannot	1
I	1
now,	1
as	1
three	1
months	1
ago,	1
draw	1
fresh	1
moral	1
strength	1
from	1
your	1
look,	1
so	1
gentle,	1
calm,	1
and	1
penetrating,	1
a	1
look	1
I	1
loved	1
so	1
well	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
write?	1
	1
Having	1
read	1
thus	1
far,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
mirror	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
her	1
right.	1
It	1
reflected	1
a	1
weak,	1
ungraceful	1
figure	1
and	1
thin	1
face.	1
Her	1
eyes,	1
always	1
sad,	1
now	1
looked	1
with	1
particular	1
hopelessness	1
at	1
her	1
reflection	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
"She	1
flatters	1
me,"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess,	1
turning	1
away	1
and	1
continuing	1
to	1
read.	1
But	1
Julie	1
did	1
not	1
flatter	1
her	1
friend,	1
the	1
princess'	1
eyes--large,	1
deep	1
and	1
luminous	1
(it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
radiated	1
from	1
them	1
shafts	1
of	1
warm	1
light)--were	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
very	1
often	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
plainness	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
they	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
attraction	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
beauty.	1
But	1
the	1
princess	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
eyes--the	1
look	1
they	1
had	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
herself.	1
As	1
with	1
everyone,	1
her	1
face	1
assumed	1
a	1
forced	1
unnatural	1
expression	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
in	1
a	1
glass.	1
She	1
went	1
on	1
reading:	1
	1
All	1
Moscow	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
war.	1
One	1
of	1
my	1
two	1
brothers	1
is	1
already	1
abroad,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
Guards,	1
who	1
are	1
starting	1
on	1
their	1
march	1
to	1
the	1
frontier.	1
Our	1
dear	1
Emperor	1
has	1
left	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
intends	1
to	1
expose	1
his	1
precious	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
war.	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
Corsican	1
monster	1
who	1
is	1
destroying	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
Europe	1
may	1
be	1
overthrown	1
by	1
the	1
angel	1
whom	1
it	1
has	1
pleased	1
the	1
Almighty,	1
in	1
His	1
goodness,	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
as	1
sovereign!	1
To	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
my	1
brothers,	1
this	1
war	1
has	1
deprived	1
me	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
associations	1
nearest	1
my	1
heart.	1
I	1
mean	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
with	1
his	1
enthusiasm	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
remain	1
inactive	1
and	1
has	1
left	1
the	1
university	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
you,	1
dear	1
Mary,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
youth	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
grief	1
to	1
me.	1
This	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
summer,	1
is	1
so	1
noble-minded	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
that	1
real	1
youthfulness	1
which	1
one	1
seldom	1
finds	1
nowadays	1
among	1
our	1
old	1
men	1
of	1
twenty	1
and,	1
particularly,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
frank	1
and	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
heart.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
pure	1
and	1
poetic	1
that	1
my	1
relations	1
with	1
him,	1
transient	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
comforts	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
heart,	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
suffered	1
so	1
much.	1
Someday	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
our	1
parting	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
then.	1
That	1
is	1
still	1
too	1
fresh.	1
Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
you	1
are	1
happy	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
these	1
poignant	1
joys	1
and	1
sorrows.	1
You	1
are	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
stronger!	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Count	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
too	1
young	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
this	1
sweet	1
friendship,	1
this	1
poetic	1
and	1
pure	1
intimacy,	1
were	1
what	1
my	1
heart	1
needed.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this!	1
The	1
chief	1
news,	1
about	1
which	1
all	1
Moscow	1
gossips,	1
is	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
old	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
Fancy!	1
The	1
three	1
princesses	1
have	1
received	1
very	1
little,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
nothing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre	1
who	1
has	1
inherited	1
all	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
has	1
besides	1
been	1
recognized	1
as	1
legitimate;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
possessor	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
fortune	1
in	1
Russia.	1
It	1
is	1
rumored	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
played	1
a	1
very	1
despicable	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
quite	1
crestfallen.	1
	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
understand	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
all	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
wills	1
and	1
inheritance;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
know	1
that	1
since	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
plain	1
Monsieur	1
Pierre,	1
has	1
become	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
fortunes	1
in	1
Russia,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
amused	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
and	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
mammas	1
burdened	1
by	1
marriageable	1
daughters,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
themselves,	1
toward	1
him,	1
though,	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
me,	1
he	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
poor	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
past	1
two	1
years	1
people	1
have	1
amused	1
themselves	1
by	1
finding	1
husbands	1
for	1
me	1
(most	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
know),	1
the	1
matchmaking	1
chronicles	1
of	1
Moscow	1
now	1
speak	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
Countess	1
Bezukhova.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
for	1
the	1
post.	1
A	1
propos	1
of	1
marriages:	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
while	1
ago	1
that	1
universal	1
auntie	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
told	1
me,	1
under	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
strict	1
secrecy,	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
than	1
with	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
son	1
Anatole,	1
whom	1
they	1
wish	1
to	1
reform	1
by	1
marrying	1
him	1
to	1
someone	1
rich	1
and	1
distinguee,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
you	1
that	1
his	1
relations'	1
choice	1
has	1
fallen.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
handsome	1
and	1
a	1
terrible	1
scapegrace.	1
That	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
gossip.	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
second	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
and	1
Mamma	1
has	1
sent	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
Apraksins'.	1
Read	1
the	1
mystical	1
book	1
I	1
am	1
sending	1
you;	1
it	1
has	1
an	1
enormous	1
success	1
here.	1
Though	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
in	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
the	1
feeble	1
human	1
mind	1
to	1
grasp,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
admirable	1
book	1
which	1
calms	1
and	1
elevates	1
the	1
soul.	1
Adieu!	1
Give	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
monsieur	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
compliments	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
I	1
embrace	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
love	1
you.	1
	1
JULIE	1
	1
P.S.	1
Let	1
me	1
have	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
charming	1
little	1
wife.	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
pondered	1
awhile	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
smile	1
and	1
her	1
luminous	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
entirely	1
transformed.	1
Then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
rose	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
tread	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
over	1
it.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
reply	1
she	1
wrote,	1
also	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
Dear	1
and	1
precious	1
Friend,	1
Your	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
13th	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
great	1
delight.	1
So	1
you	1
still	1
love	1
me,	1
my	1
romantic	1
Julie?	1
Separation,	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
is	1
bad,	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
its	1
usual	1
effect	1
on	1
you.	1
You	1
complain	1
of	1
our	1
separation.	1
What	1
then	1
should	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
I	1
dared	1
complain,	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
dear	1
to	1
me?	1
Ah,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
religion	1
to	1
console	1
us	1
life	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sad.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
look	1
severely	1
on	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
that	1
young	1
man?	1
On	1
such	1
matters	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
severe	1
with	1
myself.	1
I	1
understand	1
such	1
feelings	1
in	1
others,	1
and	1
if	1
never	1
having	1
felt	1
them	1
I	1
cannot	1
approve	1
of	1
them,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
them.	1
Only	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Christian	1
love,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbor,	1
love	1
of	1
one's	1
enemy,	1
is	1
worthier,	1
sweeter,	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
the	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
can	1
inspire	1
in	1
a	1
romantic	1
and	1
loving	1
young	1
girl	1
like	1
yourself.	1
	1
The	1
news	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
death	1
reached	1
us	1
before	1
your	1
letter	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
much	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
says	1
the	1
count	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
representative	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
century,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
turn	1
now,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
turn	1
come	1
as	1
late	1
as	1
possible.	1
God	1
preserve	1
us	1
from	1
that	1
terrible	1
misfortune!	1
	1
I	1
cannot	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
about	1
Pierre,	1
whom	1
I	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
heart,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
I	1
value	1
most	1
in	1
people.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
inheritance	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
played	1
by	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
for	1
both.	1
Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour's	1
words,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
are	1
terribly	1
true.	1
I	1
pity	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
but	1
am	1
still	1
more	1
sorry	1
for	1
Pierre.	1
So	1
young,	1
and	1
burdened	1
with	1
such	1
riches--to	1
what	1
temptations	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
exposed!	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
asked	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
most	1
on	1
earth,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
poorer	1
than	1
the	1
poorest	1
beggar.	1
A	1
thousand	1
thanks,	1
dear	1
friend,	1
for	1
the	1
volume	1
you	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
such	1
success	1
in	1
Moscow.	1
Yet	1
since	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
among	1
some	1
good	1
things	1
it	1
contains	1
others	1
which	1
our	1
weak	1
human	1
understanding	1
cannot	1
grasp,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
rather	1
useless	1
to	1
spend	1
time	1
in	1
reading	1
what	1
is	1
unintelligible	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit.	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
understand	1
the	1
fondness	1
some	1
people	1
have	1
for	1
confusing	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
mystical	1
books	1
that	1
merely	1
awaken	1
their	1
doubts	1
and	1
excite	1
their	1
imagination,	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
bent	1
for	1
exaggeration	1
quite	1
contrary	1
to	1
Christian	1
simplicity.	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
read	1
the	1
Epistles	1
and	1
Gospels.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
penetrate	1
what	1
mysteries	1
they	1
contain;	1
for	1
how	1
can	1
we,	1
miserable	1
sinners	1
that	1
we	1
are,	1
know	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
holy	1
secrets	1
of	1
Providence	1
while	1
we	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
flesh	1
which	1
forms	1
an	1
impenetrable	1
veil	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
Eternal?	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
studying	1
those	1
sublime	1
rules	1
which	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
has	1
left	1
for	1
our	1
guidance	1
here	1
below.	1
Let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
follow	1
them,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
let	1
our	1
feeble	1
human	1
minds	1
roam,	1
the	1
better	1
we	1
shall	1
please	1
God,	1
who	1
rejects	1
all	1
knowledge	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
Him;	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
we	1
seek	1
to	1
fathom	1
what	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
us,	1
the	1
sooner	1
will	1
He	1
vouchsafe	1
its	1
revelation	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
His	1
divine	1
Spirit.	1
	1
My	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
suitor,	1
but	1
has	1
only	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
is	1
expecting	1
a	1
visit	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
project	1
of	1
marriage	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
dear	1
sweet	1
friend,	1
that	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
marriage	1
as	1
a	1
divine	1
institution	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
conform.	1
However	1
painful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
me,	1
should	1
the	1
Almighty	1
lay	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
wife	1
and	1
mother	1
upon	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
try	1
to	1
perform	1
them	1
as	1
faithfully	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
without	1
disquieting	1
myself	1
by	1
examining	1
my	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him	1
whom	1
He	1
may	1
give	1
me	1
for	1
husband.	1
	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
my	1
brother,	1
who	1
announces	1
his	1
speedy	1
arrival	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
This	1
pleasure	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
brief	1
one,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
leave	1
us	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
this	1
unhappy	1
war	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
drawn,	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
or	1
why.	1
Not	1
only	1
where	1
you	1
are--at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
world--is	1
the	1
talk	1
all	1
of	1
war,	1
even	1
here	1
amid	1
fieldwork	1
and	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
nature--which	1
townsfolk	1
consider	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
country--rumors	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
heard	1
and	1
painfully	1
felt.	1
My	1
father	1
talks	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
marches	1
and	1
countermarches,	1
things	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
understand	1
nothing;	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
during	1
my	1
daily	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
village	1
I	1
witnessed	1
a	1
heartrending	1
scene....	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
conscripts	1
enrolled	1
from	1
our	1
people	1
and	1
starting	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
army.	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
mothers,	1
wives,	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
sobs.	1
It	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
mankind	1
has	1
forgotten	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
its	1
divine	1
Saviour,	1
Who	1
preached	1
love	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
injuries--	1
and	1
that	1
men	1
attribute	1
the	1
greatest	1
merit	1
to	1
skill	1
in	1
killing	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
Adieu,	1
dear	1
and	1
kind	1
friend;	1
may	1
our	1
divine	1
Saviour	1
and	1
His	1
most	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
keep	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
holy	1
and	1
all-powerful	1
care!	1
	1
MARY	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
are	1
sending	1
off	1
a	1
letter,	1
Princess?	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
dispatched	1
mine.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
mother,"	1
said	1
the	1
smiling	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
rapidly,	1
in	1
her	1
pleasant	1
mellow	1
tones	1
and	1
with	1
guttural	1
r's.	1
She	1
brought	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
strenuous,	1
mournful,	1
and	1
gloomy	1
world	1
a	1
quite	1
different	1
atmosphere,	1
careless,	1
lighthearted,	1
and	1
self-satisfied.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
I	1
must	1
warn	1
you,"	1
she	1
added,	1
lowering	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
evidently	1
listening	1
to	1
herself	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
speaking	1
with	1
exaggerated	1
grasseyement,	1
"the	1
prince	1
has	1
been	1
scolding	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
humor,	1
very	1
morose.	1
Be	1
prepared."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
dear	1
friend,"	1
replied	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"I	1
have	1
asked	1
you	1
never	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
humor	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
in.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
judge	1
him	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
others	1
do	1
so."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
glanced	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
and,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
five	1
minutes	1
late	1
in	1
starting	1
her	1
practice	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
alarm.	1
Between	1
twelve	1
and	1
two	1
o'clock,	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
mapped	1
out,	1
the	1
prince	1
rested	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
played	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVI	1
	1
The	1
gray-haired	1
valet	1
was	1
sitting	1
drowsily	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
snoring	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
large	1
study.	1
From	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
through	1
the	1
closed	1
doors	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
difficult	1
passages--twenty	1
times	1
repeated--of	1
a	1
sonata	1
by	1
Dussek.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
a	1
closed	1
carriage	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
helped	1
his	1
little	1
wife	1
to	1
alight,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
before	1
him.	1
Old	1
Tikhon,	1
wearing	1
a	1
wig,	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
antechamber,	1
reported	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
hastily	1
closed	1
the	1
door.	1
Tikhon	1
knew	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
son's	1
arrival	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
unusual	1
event	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
appointed	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
apparently	1
knew	1
this	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Tikhon;	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ascertain	1
whether	1
his	1
father's	1
habits	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home	1
last,	1
and,	1
having	1
assured	1
himself	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
"He	1
will	1
get	1
up	1
in	1
twenty	1
minutes.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
across	1
to	1
Mary's	1
room,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
stouter	1
during	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
her	1
short,	1
downy,	1
smiling	1
lip	1
lifted	1
when	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
just	1
as	1
merrily	1
and	1
prettily	1
as	1
ever.	1
	1
"Why,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
palace!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
looking	1
around	1
with	1
the	1
expression	1
with	1
which	1
people	1
compliment	1
their	1
host	1
at	1
a	1
ball.	1
"Let's	1
come,	1
quick,	1
quick!"	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
round,	1
she	1
smiled	1
at	1
Tikhon,	1
at	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
footman	1
who	1
accompanied	1
them.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
Mary	1
practicing?	1
Let's	1
go	1
quietly	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
by	1
surprise."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
courteous	1
but	1
sad	1
expression.	1
	1
"You've	1
grown	1
older,	1
Tikhon,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
passing	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
who	1
kissed	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
Before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
clavichord	1
came,	1
the	1
pretty,	1
fair	1
haired	1
Frenchwoman,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
rushed	1
out	1
apparently	1
beside	1
herself	1
with	1
delight.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
what	1
joy	1
for	1
the	1
princess!"	1
exclaimed	1
she:	1
"At	1
last!	1
I	1
must	1
let	1
her	1
know."	1
	1
"No,	1
no,	1
please	1
not...	1
You	1
are	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
kissing	1
her.	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
already	1
through	1
my	1
sister-in-law's	1
friendship	1
for	1
you.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?"	1
	1
They	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
oft-repeated	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
sonata.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
grimace,	1
as	1
if	1
expecting	1
something	1
unpleasant.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
passage	1
broke	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
a	1
cry	1
was	1
heard,	1
then	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
heavy	1
tread	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
kissing.	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
princesses,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
met	1
once	1
before	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
wedding,	1
were	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
arms	1
warmly	1
pressing	1
their	1
lips	1
to	1
whatever	1
place	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
touch.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
heart,	1
with	1
a	1
beatific	1
smile	1
and	1
obviously	1
equally	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
or	1
to	1
laugh.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
frowned,	1
as	1
lovers	1
of	1
music	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
hear	1
a	1
false	1
note.	1
The	1
two	1
women	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late,	1
seized	1
each	1
other's	1
hands,	1
kissing	1
them	1
and	1
pulling	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
kissing	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
surprise	1
both	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
and	1
kissed	1
again.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
also	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
evidently	1
felt	1
ill	1
at	1
ease,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
women	1
it	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cry,	1
and	1
apparently	1
it	1
never	1
entered	1
their	1
heads	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
otherwise	1
at	1
this	1
meeting.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear!...	1
Ah!	1
Mary!"	1
they	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
then	1
laughed.	1
"I	1
dreamed	1
last	1
night..."--"You	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
us?..."	1
"Ah!	1
Mary,	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
thinner?..."	1
"And	1
you	1
have	1
grown	1
stouter!..."	1
	1
"I	1
knew	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
once,"	1
put	1
in	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
idea!..."	1
exclaimed	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"Ah,	1
Andrew,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
you."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
his	1
sister,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
crybaby	1
as	1
ever.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
had	1
turned	1
toward	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
through	1
her	1
tears	1
the	1
loving,	1
warm,	1
gentle	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
large	1
luminous	1
eyes,	1
very	1
beautiful	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
rested	1
on	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
talked	1
incessantly,	1
her	1
short,	1
downy	1
upper	1
lip	1
continually	1
and	1
rapidly	1
touching	1
her	1
rosy	1
nether	1
lip	1
when	1
necessary	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
again	1
next	1
moment	1
when	1
her	1
face	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
glittering	1
teeth	1
and	1
sparkling	1
eyes.	1
She	1
told	1
of	1
an	1
accident	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
Spasski	1
Hill	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
serious	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
condition,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
all	1
her	1
clothes	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
that	1
heaven	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
dress	1
in	1
here;	1
and	1
that	1
Andrew	1
had	1
quite	1
changed,	1
and	1
that	1
Kitty	1
Odyntsova	1
had	1
married	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
suitor	1
for	1
Mary,	1
a	1
real	1
one,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
later.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
still	1
looking	1
silently	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
sadness.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
following	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
independent	1
of	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
words.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
Petersburg	1
fete	1
she	1
addressed	1
her	1
brother:	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
Andrew?"	1
she	1
said	1
sighing.	1
	1
Lise	1
sighed	1
too.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
even	1
tomorrow,"	1
replied	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
leaving	1
me	1
here,	1
God	1
knows	1
why,	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
promotion..."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
but	1
continuing	1
her	1
train	1
of	1
thought	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
glance	1
at	1
her	1
figure.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
certain?"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
changed.	1
She	1
sighed	1
and	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
quite	1
certain.	1
Ah!	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
dreadful..."	1
	1
Her	1
lip	1
descended.	1
She	1
brought	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"She	1
needs	1
rest,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
"Don't	1
you,	1
Lise?	1
Take	1
her	1
to	1
your	1
room	1
and	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
Father.	1
How	1
is	1
he?	1
Just	1
the	1
same?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
just	1
the	1
same.	1
Though	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
your	1
opinion	1
will	1
be,"	1
answered	1
the	1
princess	1
joyfully.	1
	1
"And	1
are	1
the	1
hours	1
the	1
same?	1
And	1
the	1
walks	1
in	1
the	1
avenues?	1
And	1
the	1
lathe?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
weaknesses.	1
	1
"The	1
hours	1
are	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
the	1
lathe,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
mathematics	1
and	1
my	1
geometry	1
lessons,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gleefully,	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
lessons	1
in	1
geometry	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
greatest	1
delights	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
twenty	1
minutes	1
had	1
elapsed	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
get	1
up,	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
young	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
his	1
usual	1
routine	1
in	1
honor	1
of	1
his	1
son's	1
arrival:	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
admit	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
apartments	1
while	1
he	1
dressed	1
for	1
dinner.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
always	1
dressed	1
in	1
old-fashioned	1
style,	1
wearing	1
an	1
antique	1
coat	1
and	1
powdered	1
hair;	1
and	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
his	1
father's	1
dressing	1
room	1
(not	1
with	1
the	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
and	1
manner	1
he	1
wore	1
in	1
drawing	1
rooms,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
animated	1
face	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
Pierre),	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
leather-covered	1
chair,	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
powdering	1
mantle,	1
entrusting	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
Tikhon.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
here's	1
the	1
warrior!	1
Wants	1
to	1
vanquish	1
Buonaparte?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
powdered	1
head	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
tail,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
holding	1
fast	1
to	1
plait,	1
would	1
allow.	1
	1
"You	1
at	1
least	1
must	1
tackle	1
him	1
properly,	1
or	1
else	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
he'll	1
soon	1
have	1
us,	1
too,	1
for	1
his	1
subjects!	1
How	1
are	1
you?"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
cheek.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
temper	1
after	1
his	1
nap	1
before	1
dinner.	1
(He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
nap	1
"after	1
dinner	1
was	1
silver--before	1
dinner,	1
golden.")	1
He	1
cast	1
happy,	1
sidelong	1
glances	1
at	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
indicated	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
on	1
his	1
father's	1
favorite	1
topic--	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
more	1
particularly	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
brought	1
my	1
wife	1
who	1
is	1
pregnant,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
following	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
father's	1
face	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
and	1
respectful	1
look.	1
"How	1
is	1
your	1
health?"	1
	1
"Only	1
fools	1
and	1
rakes	1
fall	1
ill,	1
my	1
boy.	1
You	1
know	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
busy	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
night	1
and	1
abstemious,	1
so	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
am	1
well."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God,"	1
said	1
his	1
son	1
smiling.	1
	1
"God	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it!	1
Well,	1
go	1
on,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
hobby;	1
"tell	1
me	1
how	1
the	1
Germans	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
to	1
fight	1
Bonaparte	1
by	1
this	1
new	1
science	1
you	1
call	1
'strategy.'"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
collect	1
my	1
wits,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
showed	1
that	1
his	1
father's	1
foibles	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
his	1
son	1
from	1
loving	1
and	1
honoring	1
him.	1
"Why,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
settle	1
down!"	1
	1
"Nonsense,	1
nonsense!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
shaking	1
his	1
pigtail	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
firmly	1
plaited,	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
"The	1
house	1
for	1
your	1
wife	1
is	1
ready.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
will	1
take	1
her	1
there	1
and	1
show	1
her	1
over,	1
and	1
they'll	1
talk	1
nineteen	1
to	1
the	1
dozen.	1
That's	1
their	1
woman's	1
way!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
Sit	1
down	1
and	1
talk.	1
About	1
Mikhelson's	1
army	1
I	1
understand--Tolstoy's	1
too...	1
a	1
simultaneous	1
expedition....	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
southern	1
army	1
to	1
do?	1
Prussia	1
is	1
neutral...	1
I	1
know	1
that.	1
What	1
about	1
Austria?"	1
said	1
he,	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
followed	1
by	1
Tikhon,	1
who	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
handing	1
him	1
different	1
articles	1
of	1
clothing.	1
"What	1
of	1
Sweden?	1
How	1
will	1
they	1
cross	1
Pomerania?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
seeing	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
insisted,	1
began--at	1
first	1
reluctantly,	1
but	1
gradually	1
with	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animation,	1
and	1
from	1
habit	1
changing	1
unconsciously	1
from	1
Russian	1
to	1
French	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on--to	1
explain	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
operation	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
campaign.	1
He	1
explained	1
how	1
an	1
army,	1
ninety	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
was	1
to	1
threaten	1
Prussia	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
neutrality	1
and	1
draw	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
war;	1
how	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
army	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
some	1
Swedish	1
forces	1
at	1
Stralsund;	1
how	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
Austrians,	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Russians,	1
were	1
to	1
operate	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
Rhine;	1
how	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
Russians	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
English	1
were	1
to	1
land	1
at	1
Naples,	1
and	1
how	1
a	1
total	1
force	1
of	1
five	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
was	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
different	1
sides.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
evince	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
during	1
this	1
explanation,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
it	1
continued	1
to	1
dress	1
while	1
walking	1
about,	1
and	1
three	1
times	1
unexpectedly	1
interrupted.	1
Once	1
he	1
stopped	1
it	1
by	1
shouting:	1
"The	1
white	1
one,	1
the	1
white	1
one!"	1
	1
This	1
meant	1
that	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
not	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
waistcoat	1
he	1
wanted.	1
Another	1
time	1
he	1
interrupted,	1
saying:	1
	1
"And	1
will	1
she	1
soon	1
be	1
confined?"	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
reproachfully	1
said:	1
"That's	1
bad!	1
Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on."	1
	1
The	1
third	1
interruption	1
came	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
finishing	1
his	1
description.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
sing,	1
in	1
the	1
cracked	1
voice	1
of	1
old	1
age:	1
"Malbrook	1
s'en	1
va-t-en	1
guerre.	1
Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Marlborough	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wars;	1
God	1
knows	1
when	1
he'll	1
return."	1
	1
His	1
son	1
only	1
smiled.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
say	1
it's	1
a	1
plan	1
I	1
approve	1
of,"	1
said	1
the	1
son;	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
telling	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Napoleon	1
has	1
also	1
formed	1
his	1
plan	1
by	1
now,	1
not	1
worse	1
than	1
this	1
one."	1
	1
"Well,	1
you've	1
told	1
me	1
nothing	1
new,"	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
repeated,	1
meditatively	1
and	1
rapidly:	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
room."	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XXVII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
appointed	1
hour	1
the	1
prince,	1
powdered	1
and	1
shaven,	1
entered	1
the	1
dining	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
daughter-in-law,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
were	1
already	1
awaiting	1
him	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
architect,	1
who	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
caprice	1
of	1
his	1
employer's	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
table	1
though	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
that	1
insignificant	1
individual	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
certainly	1
not	1
have	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
honor.	1
The	1
prince,	1
who	1
generally	1
kept	1
very	1
strictly	1
to	1
social	1
distinctions	1
and	1
rarely	1
admitted	1
even	1
important	1
government	1
officials	1
to	1
his	1
table,	1
had	1
unexpectedly	1
selected	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
(who	1
always	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
blow	1
his	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
checked	1
handkerchief)	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
equals,	1
and	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
impressed	1
on	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
was	1
"not	1
a	1
whit	1
worse	1
than	1
you	1
or	1
I."	1
At	1
dinner	1
the	1
prince	1
usually	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
taciturn	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
to	1
anyone	1
else.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
dining	1
room,	1
which	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
lofty,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
and	1
the	1
footmen--one	1
behind	1
each	1
chair--stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
enter.	1
The	1
head	1
butler,	1
napkin	1
on	1
arm,	1
was	1
scanning	1
the	1
setting	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
footmen,	1
and	1
anxiously	1
glancing	1
from	1
the	1
clock	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
to	1
enter.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
gilt	1
frame,	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
containing	1
the	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
of	1
the	1
Princes	1
Bolkonski,	1
opposite	1
which	1
hung	1
another	1
such	1
frame	1
with	1
a	1
badly	1
painted	1
portrait	1
(evidently	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
artist	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
estate)	1
of	1
a	1
ruling	1
prince,	1
in	1
a	1
crown--an	1
alleged	1
descendant	1
of	1
Rurik	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
Bolkonskis.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
looking	1
again	1
at	1
that	1
genealogical	1
tree,	1
shook	1
his	1
head,	1
laughing	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
laughs	1
who	1
looks	1
at	1
a	1
portrait	1
so	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
amusing.	1
	1
"How	1
thoroughly	1
like	1
him	1
that	1
is!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
surprise.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at.	1
Everything	1
her	1
father	1
did	1
inspired	1
her	1
with	1
reverence	1
and	1
was	1
beyond	1
question.	1
	1
"Everyone	1
has	1
his	1
Achilles'	1
heel,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Fancy,	1
with	1
his	1
powerful	1
mind,	1
indulging	1
in	1
such	1
nonsense!"	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
criticism	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
when	1
the	1
expected	1
footsteps	1
were	1
heard	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
study.	1
The	1
prince	1
walked	1
in	1
quickly	1
and	1
jauntily	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
wont,	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally	1
contrasting	1
the	1
briskness	1
of	1
his	1
manners	1
with	1
the	1
strict	1
formality	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
great	1
clock	1
struck	1
two	1
and	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
shrill	1
tone	1
joined	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
prince	1
stood	1
still;	1
his	1
lively	1
glittering	1
eyes	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
thick,	1
bushy	1
eyebrows	1
sternly	1
scanned	1
all	1
present	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
She	1
felt,	1
as	1
courtiers	1
do	1
when	1
the	1
Tsar	1
enters,	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
fear	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
inspired	1
in	1
all	1
around	1
him.	1
He	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
then	1
patted	1
her	1
awkwardly	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
her	1
neck.	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,	1
glad,	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
attentively	1
into	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
then	1
quickly	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
"Sit	1
down,	1
sit	1
down!	1
Sit	1
down,	1
Michael	1
Ianovich!"	1
	1
He	1
indicated	1
a	1
place	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
A	1
footman	1
moved	1
the	1
chair	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
"Ho,	1
ho!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
casting	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
rounded	1
figure.	1
"You've	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
That's	1
bad!"	1
	1
He	1
laughed	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
dry,	1
cold,	1
unpleasant	1
way,	1
with	1
his	1
lips	1
only	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
walk,	1
walk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
did	1
not,	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
hear	1
his	1
words.	1
She	1
was	1
silent	1
and	1
seemed	1
confused.	1
The	1
prince	1
asked	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
smile	1
and	1
talk.	1
He	1
asked	1
about	1
mutual	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
she	1
became	1
still	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
chattered	1
away	1
giving	1
him	1
greetings	1
from	1
various	1
people	1
and	1
retelling	1
the	1
town	1
gossip.	1
	1
"Countess	1
Apraksina,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
has	1
lost	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
cried	1
her	1
eyes	1
out,"	1
she	1
said,	1
growing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
lively.	1
	1
As	1
she	1
became	1
animated	1
the	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
sternly,	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
studied	1
her	1
sufficiently	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1
her,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
addressed	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
our	1
Bonaparte	1
will	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
of	1
it.	1
Prince	1
Andrew"	1
(he	1
always	1
spoke	1
thus	1
of	1
his	1
son)	1
"has	1
been	1
telling	1
me	1
what	1
forces	1
are	1
being	1
collected	1
against	1
him!	1
While	1
you	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
much	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know	1
when	1
"you	1
and	1
I"	1
had	1
said	1
such	1
things	1
about	1
Bonaparte,	1
but	1
understanding	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wanted	1
as	1
a	1
peg	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
hang	1
the	1
prince's	1
favorite	1
topic,	1
he	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
prince,	1
wondering	1
what	1
would	1
follow.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
tactician!"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
conversation	1
again	1
turned	1
on	1
the	1
war,	1
on	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
the	1
generals	1
and	1
statesmen	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
seemed	1
convinced	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
mere	1
babies	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
A	1
B	1
C	1
of	1
war	1
or	1
of	1
politics,	1
and	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
was	1
an	1
insignificant	1
little	1
Frenchy,	1
successful	1
only	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
Potemkins	1
or	1
Suvorovs	1
left	1
to	1
oppose	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
convinced	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
political	1
difficulties	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
no	1
real	1
war,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
puppet	1
show	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
playing,	1
pretending	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
real.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gaily	1
bore	1
with	1
his	1
father's	1
ridicule	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
men,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
on	1
and	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"The	1
past	1
always	1
seems	1
good,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
did	1
not	1
Suvorov	1
himself	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
trap	1
Moreau	1
set	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
escape?"	1
	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?	1
Who?"	1
cried	1
the	1
prince.	1
"Suvorov!"	1
And	1
he	1
jerked	1
away	1
his	1
plate,	1
which	1
Tikhon	1
briskly	1
caught.	1
"Suvorov!...	1
Consider,	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
Two...	1
Frederick	1
and	1
Suvorov;	1
Moreau!...	1
Moreau	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
prisoner	1
if	1
Suvorov	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
free	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath	1
on	1
his	1
hands.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
puzzled	1
the	1
devil	1
himself!	1
When	1
you	1
get	1
there	1
you'll	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
those	1
Hofs-	1
kriegs-wurst-Raths	1
are!	1
Suvorov	1
couldn't	1
manage	1
them	1
so	1
what	1
chance	1
has	1
Michael	1
Kutuzov?	1
No,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"you	1
and	1
your	1
generals	1
won't	1
get	1
on	1
against	1
Buonaparte;	1
you'll	1
have	1
to	1
call	1
in	1
the	1
French,	1
so	1
that	1
birds	1
of	1
a	1
feather	1
may	1
fight	1
together.	1
The	1
German,	1
Pahlen,	1
has	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
New	1
York	1
in	1
America,	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
Frenchman,	1
Moreau,"	1
he	1
said,	1
alluding	1
to	1
the	1
invitation	1
made	1
that	1
year	1
to	1
Moreau	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
Russian	1
service....	1
"Wonderful!...	1
Were	1
the	1
Potemkins,	1
Suvorovs,	1
and	1
Orlovs	1
Germans?	1
No,	1
lad,	1
either	1
you	1
fellows	1
have	1
all	1
lost	1
your	1
wits,	1
or	1
I	1
have	1
outlived	1
mine.	1
May	1
God	1
help	1
you,	1
but	1
we'll	1
see	1
what	1
will	1
happen.	1
Buonaparte	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
commander	1
among	1
them!	1
Hm!..."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
say	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
plans	1
are	1
good,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"I	1
am	1
only	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bonaparte.	1
You	1
may	1
laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
Bonaparte	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
general!"	1
	1
"Michael	1
Ivanovich!"	1
cried	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
the	1
architect	1
who,	1
busy	1
with	1
his	1
roast	1
meat,	1
hoped	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten:	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
Buonaparte	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
tactician?	1
Here,	1
he	1
says	1
the	1
same	1
thing."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
replied	1
the	1
architect.	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
was	1
born	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
spoon	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
He	1
has	1
got	1
splendid	1
soldiers.	1
Besides	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
attacking	1
Germans.	1
And	1
only	1
idlers	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
Germans.	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
everybody	1
has	1
beaten	1
the	1
Germans.	1
They	1
beat	1
no	1
one--except	1
one	1
another.	1
He	1
made	1
his	1
reputation	1
fighting	1
them."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
began	1
explaining	1
all	1
the	1
blunders	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
him,	1
Bonaparte	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
his	1
campaigns	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
politics.	1
His	1
son	1
made	1
no	1
rejoinder,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
whatever	1
arguments	1
were	1
presented	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
little	1
able	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
change	1
his	1
opinion.	1
He	1
listened,	1
refraining	1
from	1
a	1
reply,	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
wondered	1
how	1
this	1
old	1
man,	1
living	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
years,	1
could	1
know	1
and	1
discuss	1
so	1
minutely	1
and	1
acutely	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
European	1
military	1
and	1
political	1
events.	1
	1
"You	1
think	1
I'm	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
don't	1
understand	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs?"	1
concluded	1
his	1
father.	1
"But	1
it	1
troubles	1
me.	1
I	1
don't	1
sleep	1
at	1
night.	1
Come	1
now,	1
where	1
has	1
this	1
great	1
commander	1
of	1
yours	1
shown	1
his	1
skill?"	1
he	1
concluded.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
take	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
tell,"	1
answered	1
the	1
son.	1
	1
"Well,	1
then	1
go	1
to	1
your	1
Buonaparte!	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
here's	1
another	1
admirer	1
of	1
that	1
powder-monkey	1
emperor	1
of	1
yours,"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
excellent	1
French.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Prince,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
Bonapartist!"	1
	1
"Dieu	1
sait	1
quand	1
reviendra..."	1
hummed	1
the	1
prince	1
out	1
of	1
tune	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
still	1
more	1
so,	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
discussion	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
sat	1
silent,	1
glancing	1
with	1
a	1
frightened	1
look	1
now	1
at	1
her	1
father-in-	1
law	1
and	1
now	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
arm	1
and	1
drew	1
her	1
into	1
another	1
room.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
clever	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
is,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
kind!"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXVIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
next	1
evening.	1
The	1
old	1
prince,	1
not	1
altering	1
his	1
routine,	1
retired	1
as	1
usual	1
after	1
dinner.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
sister-in-law's	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
a	1
traveling	1
coat	1
without	1
epaulettes	1
had	1
been	1
packing	1
with	1
his	1
valet	1
in	1
the	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
him.	1
After	1
inspecting	1
the	1
carriage	1
himself	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
trunks	1
put	1
in,	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
horses	1
to	1
be	1
harnessed.	1
Only	1
those	1
things	1
he	1
always	1
kept	1
with	1
him	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
room;	1
a	1
small	1
box,	1
a	1
large	1
canteen	1
fitted	1
with	1
silver	1
plate,	1
two	1
Turkish	1
pistols	1
and	1
a	1
saber--a	1
present	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Ochakov.	1
All	1
these	1
traveling	1
effects	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
order:	1
new,	1
clean,	1
and	1
in	1
cloth	1
covers	1
carefully	1
tied	1
with	1
tapes.	1
	1
When	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
or	1
changing	1
their	1
mode	1
of	1
life,	1
men	1
capable	1
of	1
reflection	1
are	1
generally	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
frame	1
of	1
mind.	1
At	1
such	1
moments	1
one	1
reviews	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face	1
looked	1
very	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
tender.	1
With	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him	1
he	1
paced	1
briskly	1
from	1
corner	1
to	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
straight	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
thoughtfully	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
Did	1
he	1
fear	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
was	1
he	1
sad	1
at	1
leaving	1
his	1
wife?--perhaps	1
both,	1
but	1
evidently	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
mood,	1
for	1
hearing	1
footsteps	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
he	1
hurriedly	1
unclasped	1
his	1
hands,	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
table	1
as	1
if	1
tying	1
the	1
cover	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
box,	1
and	1
assumed	1
his	1
usual	1
tranquil	1
and	1
impenetrable	1
expression.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
harness,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
panting	1
(she	1
had	1
apparently	1
been	1
running),	1
"and	1
I	1
did	1
so	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
talk	1
with	1
you	1
alone!	1
God	1
knows	1
how	1
long	1
we	1
may	1
again	1
be	1
parted.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
coming?	1
You	1
have	1
changed	1
so,	1
Andrusha,"	1
she	1
added,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
explain	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
	1
She	1
smiled	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
his	1
pet	1
name,	1
"Andrusha."	1
It	1
was	1
obviously	1
strange	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
stern	1
handsome	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
Andrusha-	1
-the	1
slender	1
mischievous	1
boy	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
playfellow	1
in	1
childhood.	1
	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
Lise?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
answering	1
her	1
question	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"She	1
was	1
so	1
tired	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
my	1
room.	1
Oh,	1
Andrew!	1
What	1
a	1
treasure	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
you	1
have,"	1
said	1
she,	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
facing	1
her	1
brother.	1
"She	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
child:	1
such	1
a	1
dear,	1
merry	1
child.	1
I	1
have	1
grown	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
her."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
silent,	1
but	1
the	1
princess	1
noticed	1
the	1
ironical	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
look	1
that	1
showed	1
itself	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"One	1
must	1
be	1
indulgent	1
to	1
little	1
weaknesses;	1
who	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
them,	1
Andrew?	1
Don't	1
forget	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
grown	1
up	1
and	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
so	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
rosy	1
one.	1
We	1
should	1
enter	1
into	1
everyone's	1
situation.	1
Tout	1
comprendre,	1
c'est	1
tout	1
pardonner.	1
*	1
Think	1
what	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
her,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
after	1
what	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
used	1
to,	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
in	1
her	1
condition!	1
It's	1
very	1
hard."	1
	1
	1
*	1
To	1
understand	1
all	1
is	1
to	1
forgive	1
all.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
sister,	1
as	1
we	1
smile	1
at	1
those	1
we	1
think	1
we	1
thoroughly	1
understand.	1
	1
"You	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
don't	1
think	1
the	1
life	1
terrible,"	1
he	1
replied.	1
	1
"I...	1
that's	1
different.	1
Why	1
speak	1
of	1
me?	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
any	1
other	1
life,	1
and	1
can't,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
other.	1
But	1
think,	1
Andrew:	1
for	1
a	1
young	1
society	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
during	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
all	1
alone--for	1
Papa	1
is	1
always	1
busy,	1
and	1
I...	1
well,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
poor	1
resources	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
entertaining	1
a	1
woman	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
society.	1
There	1
is	1
only	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne...."	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
like	1
your	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No?	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
kind	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
she's	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
She	1
has	1
no	1
one,	1
no	1
one.	1
To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
don't	1
need	1
her,	1
and	1
she's	1
even	1
in	1
my	1
way.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
was	1
a	1
savage,	1
and	1
now	1
am	1
even	1
more	1
so.	1
I	1
like	1
being	1
alone....	1
Father	1
likes	1
her	1
very	1
much.	1
She	1
and	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
people	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
gentle	1
and	1
kind,	1
because	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
benefactor	1
to	1
them	1
both.	1
As	1
Sterne	1
says:	1
'We	1
don't	1
love	1
people	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
us,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
them.'	1
Father	1
took	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
homeless	1
after	1
losing	1
her	1
own	1
father.	1
She	1
is	1
very	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
likes	1
her	1
way	1
of	1
reading.	1
She	1
reads	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
evenings	1
and	1
reads	1
splendidly."	1
	1
"To	1
be	1
quite	1
frank,	1
Mary,	1
I	1
expect	1
Father's	1
character	1
sometimes	1
makes	1
things	1
trying	1
for	1
you,	1
doesn't	1
it?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
suddenly.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
first	1
surprised	1
and	1
then	1
aghast	1
at	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
"For	1
me?	1
For	1
me?...	1
Trying	1
for	1
me!..."	1
said	1
she.	1
	1
"He	1
always	1
was	1
rather	1
harsh;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
he's	1
getting	1
very	1
trying,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
apparently	1
speaking	1
lightly	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
puzzle	1
or	1
test	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
good	1
in	1
every	1
way,	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
intellectual	1
pride,"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
following	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
conversation--"and	1
that's	1
a	1
great	1
sin.	1
How	1
can	1
one	1
judge	1
Father?	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
one	1
might,	1
what	1
feeling	1
except	1
veneration	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
evoke?	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
contented	1
and	1
happy	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
all	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
I	1
am."	1
	1
Her	1
brother	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
incredulously.	1
	1
"The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
me...	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
Andrew...	1
is	1
Father's	1
way	1
of	1
treating	1
religious	1
subjects.	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
immense	1
intellect	1
can	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
day,	1
and	1
can	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
astray.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
makes	1
me	1
unhappy.	1
But	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
lately	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
improvement.	1
His	1
satire	1
has	1
been	1
less	1
bitter	1
of	1
late,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
monk	1
he	1
received	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
talk	1
with."	1
	1
"Ah!	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
monk	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
powder,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
banteringly	1
yet	1
tenderly.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
mon	1
ami,	1
I	1
only	1
pray,	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
Andrew..."	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence,	1
"I	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
favor	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
you."	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it,	1
dear?"	1
	1
"No--promise	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
refuse!	1
It	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
trouble	1
and	1
is	1
nothing	1
unworthy	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
comfort	1
me.	1
Promise,	1
Andrusha!..."	1
said	1
she,	1
putting	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
her	1
reticule	1
but	1
not	1
yet	1
taking	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
inside	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
what	1
she	1
held	1
were	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
her	1
request	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
shown	1
before	1
the	1
request	1
was	1
granted.	1
	1
She	1
looked	1
timidly	1
at	1
her	1
brother.	1
	1
"Even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble..."	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
as	1
if	1
guessing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
about.	1
	1
"Think	1
what	1
you	1
please!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
like	1
Father.	1
Think	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
but	1
do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
Please	1
do!	1
Father's	1
father,	1
our	1
grandfather,	1
wore	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
wars."	1
(She	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
out	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
reticule.)	1
"So	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"Of	1
course.	1
What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
I	1
bless	1
you	1
with	1
this	1
icon	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
me	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
take	1
it	1
off.	1
Do	1
you	1
promise?"	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
weigh	1
a	1
hundredweight	1
and	1
won't	1
break	1
my	1
neck...	1
To	1
please	1
you..."	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
But	1
immediately,	1
noticing	1
the	1
pained	1
expression	1
his	1
joke	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
face,	1
he	1
repented	1
and	1
added:	1
"I	1
am	1
glad;	1
really,	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad."	1
	1
"Against	1
your	1
will	1
He	1
will	1
save	1
and	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
Himself,	1
for	1
in	1
Him	1
alone	1
is	1
truth	1
and	1
peace,"	1
said	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
trembling	1
with	1
emotion,	1
solemnly	1
holding	1
up	1
in	1
both	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
brother	1
a	1
small,	1
oval,	1
antique,	1
dark-faced	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Saviour	1
in	1
a	1
gold	1
setting,	1
on	1
a	1
finely	1
wrought	1
silver	1
chain.	1
	1
She	1
crossed	1
herself,	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon,	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Andrew,	1
for	1
my	1
sake!..."	1
	1
Rays	1
of	1
gentle	1
light	1
shone	1
from	1
her	1
large,	1
timid	1
eyes.	1
Those	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
thin,	1
sickly	1
face	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
beautiful.	1
Her	1
brother	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
icon,	1
but	1
she	1
stopped	1
him.	1
Andrew	1
understood,	1
crossed	1
himself	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
icon.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
touched,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
irony	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
my	1
dear."	1
She	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
They	1
were	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
	1
"As	1
I	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
you,	1
Andrew,	1
be	1
kind	1
and	1
generous	1
as	1
you	1
always	1
used	1
to	1
be.	1
Don't	1
judge	1
Lise	1
harshly,"	1
she	1
began.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
sweet,	1
so	1
good-	1
natured,	1
and	1
her	1
position	1
now	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
hard	1
one."	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
complained	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
to	1
you,	1
Masha,	1
or	1
blamed	1
her.	1
Why	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
me?"	1
	1
Red	1
patches	1
appeared	1
on	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
face	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
silent	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
guilty.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
talked	1
to.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
that,"	1
he	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
patches	1
grew	1
deeper	1
on	1
her	1
forehead,	1
neck,	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
Her	1
brother	1
had	1
guessed	1
right:	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
been	1
crying	1
after	1
dinner	1
and	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
her	1
forebodings	1
about	1
her	1
confinement,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
dreaded	1
it,	1
and	1
had	1
complained	1
of	1
her	1
fate,	1
her	1
father-in-law,	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
After	1
crying	1
she	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
	1
"Know	1
this,	1
Masha:	1
I	1
can't	1
reproach,	1
have	1
not	1
reproached,	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
reproach	1
my	1
wife	1
with	1
anything,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
reproach	1
myself	1
with	1
anything	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
that	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
in	1
whatever	1
circumstances	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
placed.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth...	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
happy?	1
No!	1
Is	1
she	1
happy?	1
No!	1
But	1
why	1
this	1
is	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
know..."	1
	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
rose,	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
and,	1
stooping,	1
kissed	1
her	1
forehead.	1
His	1
fine	1
eyes	1
lit	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
thoughtful,	1
kindly,	1
and	1
unaccustomed	1
brightness,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
sister	1
but	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
toward	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
doorway.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
good-by.	1
Or--go	1
and	1
wake	1
and	1
I'll	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
Petrushka!"	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
valet:	1
"Come	1
here,	1
take	1
these	1
away.	1
Put	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
right."	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
rose	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
then	1
stopped	1
and	1
said:	1
"Andrew,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
faith	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
turned	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
asked	1
Him	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
feel,	1
and	1
your	1
prayer	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
answered."	1
	1
"Well,	1
may	1
be!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Go,	1
Masha;	1
I'll	1
come	1
immediately."	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
sister's	1
room,	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
connected	1
one	1
wing	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
smiling	1
sweetly.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
day	1
that,	1
with	1
an	1
ecstatic	1
and	1
artless	1
smile,	1
she	1
had	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
secluded	1
passages.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
your	1
room,"	1
she	1
said,	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
blushing	1
and	1
dropping	1
her	1
eyes.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
anger	1
suddenly	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
forehead	1
and	1
hair,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
eyes,	1
with	1
such	1
contempt	1
that	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
blushed	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
his	1
sister's	1
room	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
already	1
awake	1
and	1
her	1
merry	1
voice,	1
hurrying	1
one	1
word	1
after	1
another,	1
came	1
through	1
the	1
open	1
door.	1
She	1
was	1
speaking	1
as	1
usual	1
in	1
French,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
after	1
long	1
self-restraint	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
lost	1
time.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
imagine	1
the	1
old	1
Countess	1
Zubova,	1
with	1
false	1
curls	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
false	1
teeth,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
cheat	1
old	1
age....	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!	1
Mary!"	1
	1
This	1
very	1
sentence	1
about	1
Countess	1
Zubova	1
and	1
this	1
same	1
laugh	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
already	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
others	1
some	1
five	1
times.	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
softly.	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
plump	1
and	1
rosy,	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair	1
with	1
her	1
work	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
talking	1
incessantly,	1
repeating	1
Petersburg	1
reminiscences	1
and	1
even	1
phrases.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up,	1
stroked	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
she	1
felt	1
rested	1
after	1
their	1
journey.	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
continued	1
her	1
chatter.	1
	1
The	1
coach	1
with	1
six	1
horses	1
was	1
waiting	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
autumn	1
night,	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
the	1
coachman	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
carriage	1
pole.	1
Servants	1
with	1
lanterns	1
were	1
bustling	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
porch.	1
The	1
immense	1
house	1
was	1
brilliant	1
with	1
lights	1
shining	1
through	1
its	1
lofty	1
windows.	1
The	1
domestic	1
serfs	1
were	1
crowding	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
waiting	1
to	1
bid	1
good-by	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
prince.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
were	1
all	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
reception	1
hall:	1
Michael	1
Ivanovich,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
father's	1
study	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
good-by	1
to	1
him	1
alone.	1
All	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
study	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
old-age	1
spectacles	1
and	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
received	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
his	1
son,	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
writing.	1
He	1
glanced	1
round.	1
	1
"Going?"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing.	1
	1
"I've	1
come	1
to	1
say	1
good-by."	1
	1
"Kiss	1
me	1
here,"	1
and	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
cheek:	1
"Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
thank	1
me	1
for?"	1
	1
"For	1
not	1
dilly-dallying	1
and	1
not	1
hanging	1
to	1
a	1
woman's	1
apron	1
strings.	1
The	1
Service	1
before	1
everything.	1
Thanks,	1
thanks!"	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
writing,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
quill	1
spluttered	1
and	1
squeaked.	1
"If	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
say,	1
say	1
it.	1
These	1
two	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
together,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"About	1
my	1
wife...	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
on	1
your	1
hands..."	1
	1
"Why	1
talk	1
nonsense?	1
Say	1
what	1
you	1
want."	1
	1
"When	1
her	1
confinement	1
is	1
due,	1
send	1
to	1
Moscow	1
for	1
an	1
accoucheur....	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
here...."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
stopped	1
writing	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
understanding,	1
fixed	1
his	1
stern	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
help	1
if	1
nature	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
her	1
work,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
confused.	1
"I	1
know	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
cases	1
only	1
one	1
goes	1
wrong,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
fancy	1
and	1
mine.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
her	1
things.	1
She	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
is	1
frightened."	1
	1
"Hm...	1
Hm..."	1
muttered	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
himself,	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
writing.	1
"I'll	1
do	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
signed	1
with	1
a	1
flourish	1
and	1
suddenly	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
bad	1
business,	1
eh?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
bad,	1
Father?"	1
	1
"The	1
wife!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince,	1
briefly	1
and	1
significantly.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped,	1
lad,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince.	1
"They're	1
all	1
like	1
that;	1
one	1
can't	1
unmarry.	1
Don't	1
be	1
afraid;	1
I	1
won't	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
but	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
yourself."	1
	1
He	1
seized	1
his	1
son	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
small	1
bony	1
fingers,	1
shook	1
it,	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
son's	1
face	1
with	1
keen	1
eyes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
laughed	1
his	1
frigid	1
laugh.	1
	1
The	1
son	1
sighed,	1
thus	1
admitting	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
continued	1
to	1
fold	1
and	1
seal	1
his	1
letter,	1
snatching	1
up	1
and	1
throwing	1
down	1
the	1
wax,	1
the	1
seal,	1
and	1
the	1
paper,	1
with	1
his	1
accustomed	1
rapidity.	1
	1
"What's	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
She's	1
pretty!	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
everything.	1
Make	1
your	1
mind	1
easy,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences	1
while	1
sealing	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
speak;	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
displeased	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
understood	1
him.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"Listen!"	1
said	1
he;	1
"don't	1
worry	1
about	1
your	1
wife:	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
shall	1
be.	1
Now	1
listen!	1
Give	1
this	1
letter	1
to	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich.	1
*	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
proper	1
places	1
and	1
not	1
keep	1
you	1
long	1
as	1
an	1
adjutant:	1
a	1
bad	1
position!	1
Tell	1
him	1
I	1
remember	1
and	1
like	1
him.	1
Write	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
he	1
receives	1
you.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
all	1
right--serve	1
him.	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski's	1
son	1
need	1
not	1
serve	1
under	1
anyone	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
disfavor.	1
Now	1
come	1
here."	1
	1
	1
*Kutuzov.	1
	1
He	1
spoke	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
half	1
his	1
words,	1
but	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
understand	1
him.	1
He	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
desk,	1
raised	1
the	1
lid,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
drawer,	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
an	1
exercise	1
book	1
filled	1
with	1
his	1
bold,	1
tall,	1
close	1
handwriting.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
probably	1
die	1
before	1
you.	1
So	1
remember,	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
memoirs;	1
hand	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
after	1
my	1
death.	1
Now	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
Lombard	1
bond	1
and	1
a	1
letter;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
premium	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
writes	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
Suvorov's	1
wars.	1
Send	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Academy.	1
Here	1
are	1
some	1
jottings	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
read	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
useful."	1
	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
his	1
father	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
live	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
yet.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
it.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
all,	1
Father,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now,	1
good-by!"	1
He	1
gave	1
his	1
son	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss,	1
and	1
embraced	1
him.	1
"Remember	1
this,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
if	1
they	1
kill	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
hurt	1
me,	1
your	1
old	1
father..."	1
he	1
paused	1
unexpectedly,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
voice	1
suddenly	1
shrieked:	1
"but	1
if	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
behaved	1
like	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed!"	1
	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
to	1
me,	1
Father,"	1
said	1
the	1
son	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
silent.	1
	1
"I	1
also	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
you,"	1
continued	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"if	1
I'm	1
killed	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
son,	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
you--as	1
I	1
said	1
yesterday...	1
let	1
him	1
grow	1
up	1
with	1
you....	1
Please."	1
	1
"Not	1
let	1
the	1
wife	1
have	1
him?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
They	1
stood	1
silent,	1
facing	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
old	1
man's	1
sharp	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
straight	1
on	1
his	1
son's.	1
Something	1
twitched	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prince's	1
face.	1
	1
"We've	1
said	1
good-by.	1
Go!"	1
he	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
angry	1
voice,	1
opening	1
his	1
door.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?	1
What?"	1
asked	1
both	1
princesses	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
spectacled	1
and	1
wigless,	1
shouting	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sighed	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Well!"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
And	1
this	1
"Well!"	1
sounded	1
coldly	1
ironic,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying,:	1
"Now	1
go	1
through	1
your	1
performance."	1
	1
"Andrew,	1
already!"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
turning	1
pale	1
and	1
looking	1
with	1
dismay	1
at	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
her.	1
She	1
screamed	1
and	1
fell	1
unconscious	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
He	1
cautiously	1
released	1
the	1
shoulder	1
she	1
leaned	1
on,	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
carefully	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
easy	1
chair.	1
	1
"Adieu,	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
he	1
gently	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
kissing	1
her,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
rapid	1
steps.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
armchair,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
chafing	1
her	1
temples.	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
supporting	1
her	1
sister-in-law,	1
still	1
looked	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
through	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
in	1
his	1
direction.	1
From	1
the	1
study,	1
like	1
pistol	1
shots,	1
came	1
the	1
frequent	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
angrily	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose.	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gone	1
when	1
the	1
study	1
door	1
opened	1
quickly	1
and	1
the	1
stern	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
dressing	1
gown	1
looked	1
out.	1
	1
"Gone?	1
That's	1
all	1
right!"	1
said	1
he;	1
and	1
looking	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
unconscious	1
little	1
princess,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
reprovingly	1
and	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
In	1
October,	1
1805,	1
a	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
occupying	1
the	1
villages	1
and	1
towns	1
of	1
the	1
Archduchy	1
of	1
Austria,	1
and	1
yet	1
other	1
regiments	1
freshly	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia	1
were	1
settling	1
near	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
Braunau	1
and	1
burdening	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
quartered.	1
Braunau	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
1805,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
had	1
halted	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
the	1
town,	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
inspected	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
Despite	1
the	1
un-Russian	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
locality	1
and	1
surroundings--fruit	1
gardens,	1
stone	1
fences,	1
tiled	1
roofs,	1
and	1
hills	1
in	1
the	1
distance--and	1
despite	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
(who	1
gazed	1
with	1
curiosity	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers)	1
were	1
not	1
Russians,	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
just	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
any	1
Russian	1
regiment	1
preparing	1
for	1
an	1
inspection	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Russia.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
day's	1
march	1
an	1
order	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
inspect	1
the	1
regiment	1
on	1
the	1
march.	1
Though	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
were	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
arose	1
whether	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
marching	1
order	1
or	1
not,	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
at	1
a	1
consultation	1
between	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
parade	1
order,	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
better	1
to	1
"bow	1
too	1
low	1
than	1
not	1
bow	1
low	1
enough."	1
So	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
after	1
a	1
twenty-mile	1
march,	1
were	1
kept	1
mending	1
and	1
cleaning	1
all	1
night	1
long	1
without	1
closing	1
their	1
eyes,	1
while	1
the	1
adjutants	1
and	1
company	1
commanders	1
calculated	1
and	1
reckoned,	1
and	1
by	1
morning	1
the	1
regiment--instead	1
of	1
the	1
straggling,	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
its	1
last	1
march	1
the	1
day	1
before--presented	1
a	1
well-ordered	1
array	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
each	1
of	1
whom	1
knew	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
his	1
duty,	1
had	1
every	1
button	1
and	1
every	1
strap	1
in	1
place,	1
and	1
shone	1
with	1
cleanliness.	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
externally	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
order,	1
but	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
look	1
under	1
the	1
uniforms	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
on	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
knapsack	1
the	1
appointed	1
number	1
of	1
articles,	1
"awl,	1
soap,	1
and	1
all,"	1
as	1
the	1
soldiers	1
say.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
circumstance	1
concerning	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
be	1
at	1
ease.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
boots.	1
More	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
men's	1
boots	1
were	1
in	1
holes.	1
But	1
this	1
defect	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
repeated	1
demands	1
boots	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
issued	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
commissariat,	1
and	1
the	1
regiment	1
had	1
marched	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
miles.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
an	1
elderly,	1
choleric,	1
stout,	1
and	1
thick-set	1
general	1
with	1
grizzled	1
eyebrows	1
and	1
whiskers,	1
and	1
wider	1
from	1
chest	1
to	1
back	1
than	1
across	1
the	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
brand-new	1
uniform	1
showing	1
the	1
creases	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
folded	1
and	1
thick	1
gold	1
epaulettes	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
stand	1
rather	1
than	1
lie	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
massive	1
shoulders.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
happily	1
performing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
walked	1
about	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
pulled	1
himself	1
up,	1
slightly	1
arching	1
his	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
admired	1
his	1
regiment,	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
mind	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
it,	1
yet	1
his	1
strut	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate	1
that,	1
besides	1
military	1
matters,	1
social	1
interests	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
sex	1
occupied	1
no	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
sir?"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
commanders	1
who	1
smilingly	1
pressed	1
forward	1
(it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
felt	1
happy).	1
"We	1
had	1
our	1
hands	1
full	1
last	1
night.	1
However,	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
regiment	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
eh?"	1
	1
The	1
battalion	1
commander	1
perceived	1
the	1
jovial	1
irony	1
and	1
laughed.	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
turned	1
off	1
the	1
field	1
even	1
on	1
the	1
Tsaritsin	1
Meadow."	1
	1
"What?"	1
asked	1
the	1
commander.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
on	1
which	1
signalers	1
had	1
been	1
posted,	1
two	1
men	1
appeared	1
on	1
horse	1
back.	1
They	1
were	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
Cossack.	1
	1
The	1
aide-de-camp	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
order	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
clearly	1
worded	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
namely,	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
regiment	1
just	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
march:	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats,	1
and	1
packs,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
preparation	1
whatever.	1
	1
A	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
from	1
Vienna	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
with	1
proposals	1
and	1
demands	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
join	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
Mack,	1
and	1
Kutuzov,	1
not	1
considering	1
this	1
junction	1
advisable,	1
meant,	1
among	1
other	1
arguments	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
view,	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
regiment;	1
so	1
the	1
worse	1
the	1
condition	1
it	1
was	1
in,	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
the	1
commander-	1
in-chief	1
would	1
be.	1
Though	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
nevertheless	1
delivered	1
the	1
definite	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
and	1
in	1
marching	1
order,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
dissatisfied.	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
silently	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
with	1
a	1
choleric	1
gesture.	1
	1
"A	1
fine	1
mess	1
we've	1
made	1
of	1
it!"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Michael	1
Mitrich,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
'on	1
the	1
march'	1
it	1
meant	1
in	1
greatcoats?"	1
said	1
he	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
the	1
battalion	1
commander.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!"	1
he	1
added,	1
stepping	1
resolutely	1
forward.	1
"Company	1
commanders!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
accustomed	1
to	1
command.	1
"Sergeants	1
major!...	1
How	1
soon	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
with	1
a	1
respectful	1
politeness	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
personage	1
he	1
was	1
referring	1
to.	1
	1
"In	1
an	1
hour's	1
time,	1
I	1
should	1
say."	1
	1
"Shall	1
we	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
change	1
clothes?"	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know,	1
General...."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
himself,	1
ordered	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
change	1
into	1
their	1
greatcoats.	1
The	1
company	1
commanders	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1
their	1
companies,	1
the	1
sergeants	1
major	1
began	1
bustling	1
(the	1
greatcoats	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
condition),	1
and	1
instantly	1
the	1
squares	1
that	1
had	1
up	1
to	1
then	1
been	1
in	1
regular	1
order	1
and	1
silent	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
and	1
stretch	1
and	1
hum	1
with	1
voices.	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
soldiers	1
were	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
throwing	1
up	1
their	1
knapsacks	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
of	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
pulling	1
the	1
straps	1
over	1
their	1
heads,	1
unstrapping	1
their	1
overcoats	1
and	1
drawing	1
the	1
sleeves	1
on	1
with	1
upraised	1
arms.	1
	1
In	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
all	1
was	1
again	1
in	1
order,	1
only	1
the	1
squares	1
had	1
become	1
gray	1
instead	1
of	1
black.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
walked	1
with	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
examined	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
is	1
this?	1
This!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
and	1
stood	1
still.	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company!"	1
	1
"Commander	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
wanted	1
by	1
the	1
general!...	1
commander	1
to	1
the	1
general...	1
third	1
company	1
to	1
the	1
commander."	1
The	1
words	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
an	1
adjutant	1
ran	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
missing	1
officer.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
eager	1
but	1
misrepeated	1
words	1
had	1
reached	1
their	1
destination	1
in	1
a	1
cry	1
of:	1
"The	1
general	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
company,"	1
the	1
missing	1
officer	1
appeared	1
from	1
behind	1
his	1
company	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
running,	1
trotted	1
awkwardly	1
stumbling	1
on	1
his	1
toes	1
toward	1
the	1
general.	1
The	1
captain's	1
face	1
showed	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
is	1
told	1
to	1
repeat	1
a	1
lesson	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
learned.	1
Spots	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
nose,	1
the	1
redness	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
evidently	1
due	1
to	1
intemperance,	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
twitched	1
nervously.	1
The	1
general	1
looked	1
the	1
captain	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
panting,	1
slackening	1
his	1
pace	1
as	1
he	1
approached.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
dressing	1
your	1
men	1
in	1
petticoats!	1
What	1
is	1
this?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
thrusting	1
forward	1
his	1
jaw	1
and	1
pointing	1
at	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat	1
of	1
bluish	1
cloth,	1
which	1
contrasted	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
"What	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
after?	1
The	1
commander	1
in	1
chief	1
is	1
expected	1
and	1
you	1
leave	1
your	1
place?	1
Eh?	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
fancy	1
coats	1
for	1
a	1
parade....	1
Eh...?"	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
superior,	1
pressed	1
two	1
fingers	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rigidly	1
to	1
his	1
cap,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
this	1
pressure	1
lay	1
his	1
only	1
hope	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
"Well,	1
why	1
don't	1
you	1
speak?	1
Whom	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
there	1
dressed	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
Hungarian?"	1
said	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
an	1
austere	1
gibe.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
what?	1
Your	1
excellency!	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
excellency?...	1
nobody	1
knows."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
it's	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks,"	1
said	1
the	1
captain	1
softly.	1
	1
"Well?	1
Has	1
he	1
been	1
degraded	1
into	1
a	1
field	1
marshal,	1
or	1
into	1
a	1
soldier?	1
If	1
a	1
soldier,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
dressed	1
in	1
regulation	1
uniform	1
like	1
the	1
others."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
you	1
gave	1
him	1
leave	1
yourself,	1
on	1
the	1
march."	1
	1
"Gave	1
him	1
leave?	1
Leave?	1
That's	1
just	1
like	1
you	1
young	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
cooling	1
down	1
a	1
little.	1
"Leave	1
indeed....	1
One	1
says	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
you...	1
What?"	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
renewed	1
irritation,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
to	1
dress	1
your	1
men	1
decently."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
commander,	1
turning	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant,	1
directed	1
his	1
jerky	1
steps	1
down	1
the	1
line.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
display	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
walking	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
wished	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
further	1
excuse	1
for	1
wrath.	1
Having	1
snapped	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
for	1
an	1
unpolished	1
badge,	1
at	1
another	1
because	1
his	1
line	1
was	1
not	1
straight,	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
third	1
company.	1
	1
"H-o-o-w	1
are	1
you	1
standing?	1
Where's	1
your	1
leg?	1
Your	1
leg?"	1
shouted	1
the	1
commander	1
with	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
still	1
five	1
men	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Dolokhov	1
with	1
his	1
bluish-gray	1
uniform.	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
slowly	1
straightened	1
his	1
bent	1
knee,	1
looking	1
straight	1
with	1
his	1
clear,	1
insolent	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
general's	1
face.	1
	1
"Why	1
a	1
blue	1
coat?	1
Off	1
with	1
it...	1
Sergeant	1
major!	1
Change	1
his	1
coat...	1
the	1
ras..."	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
	1
"General,	1
I	1
must	1
obey	1
orders,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure..."	1
Dolokhov	1
hurriedly	1
interrupted.	1
	1
"No	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
ranks!...	1
No	1
talking,	1
no	1
talking!"	1
	1
"Not	1
bound	1
to	1
endure	1
insults,"	1
Dolokhov	1
concluded	1
in	1
loud,	1
ringing	1
tones.	1
	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
soldier	1
met.	1
The	1
general	1
became	1
silent,	1
angrily	1
pulling	1
down	1
his	1
tight	1
scarf.	1
	1
"I	1
request	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
goodness	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
coat,"	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
turned	1
away.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
signaler	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
flushing,	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
seized	1
the	1
stirrup	1
with	1
trembling	1
hands,	1
threw	1
his	1
body	1
across	1
the	1
saddle,	1
righted	1
himself,	1
drew	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
resolute	1
countenance,	1
opening	1
his	1
mouth	1
awry,	1
prepared	1
to	1
shout.	1
The	1
regiment	1
fluttered	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
preening	1
its	1
plumage	1
and	1
became	1
motionless.	1
	1
"Att-ention!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
in	1
a	1
soul-shaking	1
voice	1
which	1
expressed	1
joy	1
for	1
himself,	1
severity	1
for	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
welcome	1
for	1
the	1
approaching	1
chief.	1
	1
Along	1
the	1
broad	1
country	1
road,	1
edged	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
by	1
trees,	1
came	1
a	1
high,	1
light	1
blue	1
Viennese	1
caleche,	1
slightly	1
creaking	1
on	1
its	1
springs	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
horses	1
at	1
a	1
smart	1
trot.	1
Behind	1
the	1
caleche	1
galloped	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
Croats.	1
Beside	1
Kutuzov	1
sat	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
that	1
looked	1
strange	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
black	1
ones.	1
The	1
caleche	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
were	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
voices	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
slightly	1
as	1
treading	1
heavily	1
he	1
stepped	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
two	1
thousand	1
men	1
breathlessly	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
command	1
rang	1
out,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
regiment	1
quivered,	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
jingling	1
sound	1
it	1
presented	1
arms.	1
Then	1
amidst	1
a	1
dead	1
silence	1
the	1
feeble	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
heard.	1
The	1
regiment	1
roared,	1
"Health	1
to	1
your	1
ex...	1
len...	1
len...	1
lency!"	1
and	1
again	1
all	1
became	1
silent.	1
At	1
first	1
Kutuzov	1
stood	1
still	1
while	1
the	1
regiment	1
moved;	1
then	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
white,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
suite,	1
walked	1
between	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
way	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
saluted	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
devoured	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
drawing	1
himself	1
up	1
obsequiously,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks	1
behind	1
the	1
generals,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
jerky	1
movements,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
darted	1
forward	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
or	1
gesture	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
performed	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
subordinate	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
zeal	1
than	1
his	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
commander.	1
Thanks	1
to	1
the	1
strictness	1
and	1
assiduity	1
of	1
its	1
commander	1
the	1
regiment,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
others	1
that	1
had	1
reached	1
Braunau	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
was	1
in	1
splendid	1
condition.	1
There	1
were	1
only	1
217	1
sick	1
and	1
stragglers.	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
order	1
except	1
the	1
boots.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
through	1
the	1
ranks,	1
sometimes	1
stopping	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
few	1
friendly	1
words	1
to	1
officers	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
war,	1
sometimes	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
Looking	1
at	1
their	1
boots	1
he	1
several	1
times	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
sadly,	1
pointing	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
blaming	1
anyone,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
noticing	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
it	1
was.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
ran	1
forward	1
on	1
each	1
such	1
occasion,	1
fearing	1
to	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
regarding	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Behind	1
Kutuzov,	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
that	1
allowed	1
every	1
softly	1
spoken	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
followed	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
suite.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
talked	1
among	1
themselves	1
and	1
sometimes	1
laughed.	1
Nearest	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
walked	1
a	1
handsome	1
adjutant.	1
This	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
Beside	1
him	1
was	1
his	1
comrade	1
Nesvitski,	1
a	1
tall	1
staff	1
officer,	1
extremely	1
stout,	1
with	1
a	1
kindly,	1
smiling,	1
handsome	1
face	1
and	1
moist	1
eyes.	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
from	1
laughter	1
provoked	1
by	1
a	1
swarthy	1
hussar	1
officer	1
who	1
walked	1
beside	1
him.	1
This	1
hussar,	1
with	1
a	1
grave	1
face	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
smile	1
or	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
fixed	1
eyes,	1
watched	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
back	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
every	1
movement.	1
Each	1
time	1
the	1
commander	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward,	1
the	1
hussar	1
started	1
and	1
bent	1
forward	1
in	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
manner.	1
Nesvitski	1
laughed	1
and	1
nudged	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
wag.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
walked	1
slowly	1
and	1
languidly	1
past	1
thousands	1
of	1
eyes	1
which	1
were	1
starting	1
from	1
their	1
sockets	1
to	1
watch	1
their	1
chief.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
he	1
suddenly	1
stopped.	1
His	1
suite,	1
not	1
having	1
expected	1
this,	1
involuntarily	1
came	1
closer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Timokhin!"	1
said	1
he,	1
recognizing	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
reprimanded	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
blue	1
greatcoat.	1
	1
One	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
more	1
than	1
Timokhin	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
reprimanded	1
by	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
addressed	1
him	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
sustained	1
it	1
had	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
evidently	1
understood	1
his	1
case	1
and	1
wished	1
him	1
nothing	1
but	1
good,	1
quickly	1
turned	1
away,	1
a	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
smile	1
flitting	1
over	1
his	1
scarred	1
and	1
puffy	1
face.	1
	1
"Another	1
Ismail	1
comrade,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"A	1
brave	1
officer!	1
Are	1
you	1
satisfied	1
with	1
him?"	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
latter--unconscious	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
reflected	1
in	1
the	1
hussar	1
officer	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
looking	1
glass--started,	1
moved	1
forward,	1
and	1
answered:	1
"Highly	1
satisfied,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
"We	1
all	1
have	1
our	1
weaknesses,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
smiling	1
and	1
walking	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"He	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
predilection	1
for	1
Bacchus."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
The	1
hussar	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
noticed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
red-nosed	1
captain	1
and	1
his	1
drawn-in	1
stomach,	1
and	1
mimicked	1
his	1
expression	1
and	1
pose	1
with	1
such	1
exactitude	1
that	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing.	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
round.	1
The	1
officer	1
evidently	1
had	1
complete	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
while	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
turning	1
managed	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
grimace	1
and	1
then	1
assume	1
a	1
most	1
serious,	1
deferential,	1
and	1
innocent	1
expression.	1
	1
The	1
third	1
company	1
was	1
the	1
last,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
pondered,	1
apparently	1
trying	1
to	1
recollect	1
something.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
suite	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
French:	1
	1
"You	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
remind	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
officer	1
Dolokhov,	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
in	1
this	1
regiment."	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
Dolokhov?"	1
asked	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
soldier's	1
gray	1
greatcoat,	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
The	1
shapely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
fair-haired	1
soldier,	1
with	1
his	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
stepped	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
ranks,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
presented	1
arms.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
a	1
complaint	1
to	1
make?"	1
Kutuzov	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
frown.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
Dolokhov,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
"I	1
hope	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lesson	1
to	1
you.	1
Do	1
your	1
duty.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
is	1
gracious,	1
and	1
I	1
shan't	1
forget	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
deserve	1
well."	1
	1
The	1
clear	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
just	1
as	1
boldly	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
seeming	1
by	1
their	1
expression	1
to	1
tear	1
open	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
convention	1
that	1
separates	1
a	1
commander-in-chief	1
so	1
widely	1
from	1
a	1
private.	1
	1
"One	1
thing	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
Dolokhov	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
firm,	1
ringing,	1
deliberate	1
voice.	1
"I	1
ask	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
my	1
fault	1
and	1
prove	1
my	1
devotion	1
to	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
to	1
Russia!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
away.	1
The	1
same	1
smile	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
from	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
again	1
flitted	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
grimace	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
everything	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
could	1
say	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
	1
The	1
regiment	1
broke	1
up	1
into	1
companies,	1
which	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
appointed	1
quarters	1
near	1
Braunau,	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
receive	1
boots	1
and	1
clothes	1
and	1
to	1
rest	1
after	1
their	1
hard	1
marches.	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
bear	1
me	1
a	1
grudge,	1
Prokhor	1
Ignatych?"	1
said	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
overtaking	1
the	1
third	1
company	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
its	1
quarters	1
and	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Captain	1
Timokhin	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
front.	1
(The	1
regimental	1
commander's	1
face	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
inspection	1
was	1
happily	1
over	1
beamed	1
with	1
irrepressible	1
delight.)	1
"It's	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
service...	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
helped...	1
one	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
bit	1
hasty	1
on	1
parade...	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
apologize,	1
you	1
know	1
me!...	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
pleased!"	1
And	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
"Don't	1
mention	1
it,	1
General,	1
as	1
if	1
I'd	1
be	1
so	1
bold!"	1
replied	1
the	1
captain,	1
his	1
nose	1
growing	1
redder	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
smile	1
which	1
showed	1
where	1
two	1
front	1
teeth	1
were	1
missing	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
knocked	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
at	1
Ismail.	1
	1
"And	1
tell	1
Mr.	1
Dolokhov	1
that	1
I	1
won't	1
forget	1
him--he	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
easy.	1
And	1
tell	1
me,	1
please--I've	1
been	1
meaning	1
to	1
ask--how	1
is	1
he	1
behaving	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
general..."	1
	1
"As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
service	1
goes	1
he	1
is	1
quite	1
punctilious,	1
your	1
excellency;	1
but	1
his	1
character..."	1
said	1
Timokhin.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
about	1
his	1
character?"	1
asked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
	1
"It's	1
different	1
on	1
different	1
days,"	1
answered	1
the	1
captain.	1
"One	1
day	1
he	1
is	1
sensible,	1
well	1
educated,	1
and	1
good-natured,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
he's	1
a	1
wild	1
beast....	1
In	1
Poland,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
he	1
nearly	1
killed	1
a	1
Jew."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
well,	1
well!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"Still,	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
misfortune.	1
You	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
important	1
connections...	1
Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
just..."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Timokhin,	1
showing	1
by	1
his	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
his	1
commander's	1
wish.	1
	1
"Well,	1
of	1
course,	1
of	1
course!"	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
sought	1
out	1
Dolokhov	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
and,	1
reining	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"After	1
the	1
next	1
affair...	1
epaulettes."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
looked	1
round	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
anything,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
mocking	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
change.	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
all	1
right,"	1
continued	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander.	1
"A	1
cup	1
of	1
vodka	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
from	1
me,"	1
he	1
added	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
soldiers	1
could	1
hear.	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all!	1
God	1
be	1
praised!"	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
that	1
company	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
next	1
one.	1
	1
"Well,	1
he's	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
one	1
can	1
serve	1
under	1
him,"	1
said	1
Timokhin	1
to	1
the	1
subaltern	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
"In	1
a	1
word,	1
a	1
hearty	1
one..."	1
said	1
the	1
subaltern,	1
laughing	1
(the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
was	1
nicknamed	1
King	1
of	1
Hearts).	1
	1
The	1
cheerful	1
mood	1
of	1
their	1
officers	1
after	1
the	1
inspection	1
infected	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
company	1
marched	1
on	1
gaily.	1
The	1
soldiers'	1
voices	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
	1
"And	1
they	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye?"	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
he	1
is!	1
Quite	1
blind!"	1
	1
"No,	1
friend,	1
he	1
is	1
sharper-eyed	1
than	1
you	1
are.	1
Boots	1
and	1
leg	1
bands...	1
he	1
noticed	1
everything..."	1
	1
"When	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
feet,	1
friend...	1
well,	1
thinks	1
I..."	1
	1
"And	1
that	1
other	1
one	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
Austrian,	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
smeared	1
with	1
chalk--as	1
white	1
as	1
flour!	1
I	1
suppose	1
they	1
polish	1
him	1
up	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
the	1
guns."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Fedeshon!...	1
Did	1
he	1
say	1
when	1
the	1
battles	1
are	1
to	1
begin?	1
You	1
were	1
near	1
him.	1
Everybody	1
said	1
that	1
Buonaparte	1
himself	1
was	1
at	1
Braunau."	1
	1
"Buonaparte	1
himself!...	1
Just	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
fool,	1
what	1
he	1
doesn't	1
know!	1
The	1
Prussians	1
are	1
up	1
in	1
arms	1
now.	1
The	1
Austrians,	1
you	1
see,	1
are	1
putting	1
them	1
down.	1
When	1
they've	1
been	1
put	1
down,	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Buonaparte	1
will	1
begin.	1
And	1
he	1
says	1
Buonaparte	1
is	1
in	1
Braunau!	1
Shows	1
you're	1
a	1
fool.	1
You'd	1
better	1
listen	1
more	1
carefully!"	1
	1
"What	1
devils	1
these	1
quartermasters	1
are!	1
See,	1
the	1
fifth	1
company	1
is	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
already...	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
their	1
buckwheat	1
cooked	1
before	1
we	1
reach	1
our	1
quarters."	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
a	1
biscuit,	1
you	1
devil!"	1
	1
"And	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
tobacco	1
yesterday?	1
That's	1
just	1
it,	1
friend!	1
Ah,	1
well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
here	1
you	1
are."	1
	1
"They	1
might	1
call	1
a	1
halt	1
here	1
or	1
we'll	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
another	1
four	1
miles	1
without	1
eating."	1
	1
"Wasn't	1
it	1
fine	1
when	1
those	1
Germans	1
gave	1
us	1
lifts!	1
You	1
just	1
sit	1
still	1
and	1
are	1
drawn	1
along."	1
	1
"And	1
here,	1
friend,	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
quite	1
beggarly.	1
There	1
they	1
all	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
Poles--all	1
under	1
the	1
Russian	1
crown--but	1
here	1
they're	1
all	1
regular	1
Germans."	1
	1
"Singers	1
to	1
the	1
front"	1
came	1
the	1
captain's	1
order.	1
	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
ranks	1
some	1
twenty	1
men	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
A	1
drummer,	1
their	1
leader,	1
turned	1
round	1
facing	1
the	1
singers,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm,	1
began	1
a	1
long-drawn-out	1
soldiers'	1
song,	1
commencing	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Morning	1
dawned,	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
rising,"	1
and	1
concluding:	1
"On	1
then,	1
brothers,	1
on	1
to	1
glory,	1
led	1
by	1
Father	1
Kamenski."	1
This	1
song	1
had	1
been	1
composed	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
campaign	1
and	1
now	1
being	1
sung	1
in	1
Austria,	1
the	1
only	1
change	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
"Father	1
Kamenski"	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
"Father	1
Kutuzov."	1
	1
Having	1
jerked	1
out	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
as	1
soldiers	1
do	1
and	1
waved	1
his	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
flinging	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
drummer--a	1
lean,	1
handsome	1
soldier	1
of	1
forty--looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
the	1
singers	1
and	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Then	1
having	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
that	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
both	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
carefully	1
lifting	1
some	1
invisible	1
but	1
precious	1
object	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
and,	1
holding	1
it	1
there	1
for	1
some	1
seconds,	1
suddenly	1
flung	1
it	1
down	1
and	1
began:	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower,	1
oh,	1
my	1
bower...!"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
bower	1
new...!"	1
chimed	1
in	1
twenty	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
castanet	1
player,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
his	1
equipment,	1
rushed	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
and,	1
walking	1
backwards	1
before	1
the	1
company,	1
jerked	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
flourished	1
his	1
castanets	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
someone.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
swinging	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
keeping	1
time	1
spontaneously,	1
marched	1
with	1
long	1
steps.	1
Behind	1
the	1
company	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
springs,	1
and	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
were	1
heard.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
suite	1
were	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
town.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
continue	1
to	1
march	1
at	1
ease,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
suite	1
showed	1
pleasure	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
singing	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
dancing	1
soldier	1
and	1
the	1
gay	1
and	1
smartly	1
marching	1
men.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
file	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
flank,	1
beside	1
which	1
the	1
carriage	1
passed	1
the	1
company,	1
a	1
blue-	1
eyed	1
soldier	1
involuntarily	1
attracted	1
notice.	1
It	1
was	1
Dolokhov	1
marching	1
with	1
particular	1
grace	1
and	1
boldness	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
those	1
driving	1
past	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
pitied	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
marching	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
The	1
hussar	1
cornet	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
who	1
had	1
mimicked	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
fell	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
Hussar	1
cornet	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
set	1
led	1
by	1
Dolokhov.	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
met	1
Dolokhov	1
abroad	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
fit	1
to	1
recognize	1
him.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
ranker,	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
cordiality	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
said	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
singing,	1
making	1
his	1
horse	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
company.	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I?"	1
Dolokhov	1
answered	1
coldly.	1
"I	1
am	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
	1
The	1
lively	1
song	1
gave	1
a	1
special	1
flavor	1
to	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
free	1
and	1
easy	1
gaiety	1
with	1
which	1
Zherkov	1
spoke,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
intentional	1
coldness	1
of	1
Dolokhov's	1
reply.	1
	1
"And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
officers?"	1
inquired	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"All	1
right.	1
They	1
are	1
good	1
fellows.	1
And	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
wriggled	1
onto	1
the	1
staff?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
attached;	1
I'm	1
on	1
duty."	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
	1
"She	1
let	1
the	1
hawk	1
fly	1
upward	1
from	1
her	1
wide	1
right	1
sleeve,"	1
went	1
the	1
song,	1
arousing	1
an	1
involuntary	1
sensation	1
of	1
courage	1
and	1
cheerfulness.	1
Their	1
conversation	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
different	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
song.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
Austrians	1
have	1
been	1
beaten?"	1
asked	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
only	1
knows!	1
They	1
say	1
so."	1
	1
"I'm	1
glad,"	1
answered	1
Dolokhov	1
briefly	1
and	1
clearly,	1
as	1
the	1
song	1
demanded.	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
come	1
round	1
some	1
evening	1
and	1
we'll	1
have	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
faro!"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"Why,	1
have	1
you	1
too	1
much	1
money?"	1
	1
"Do	1
come."	1
	1
"I	1
can't.	1
I've	1
sworn	1
not	1
to.	1
I	1
won't	1
drink	1
and	1
won't	1
play	1
till	1
I	1
get	1
reinstated."	1
	1
"Well,	1
that's	1
only	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
engagement."	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
see."	1
	1
They	1
were	1
again	1
silent.	1
	1
"Come	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
anything.	1
One	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
on	1
the	1
staff..."	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
smiled.	1
"Don't	1
trouble.	1
If	1
I	1
want	1
anything,	1
I	1
won't	1
beg--I'll	1
take	1
it!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
never	1
mind;	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
only..."	1
	1
"Good-bye."	1
	1
"Good	1
health..."	1
	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
long,	1
long	1
way.	1
To	1
my	1
native	1
land..."	1
	1
Zherkov	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
spurs;	1
it	1
pranced	1
excitedly	1
from	1
foot	1
to	1
foot	1
uncertain	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
start,	1
then	1
settled	1
down,	1
galloped	1
past	1
the	1
company,	1
and	1
overtook	1
the	1
carriage,	1
still	1
keeping	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
song.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
On	1
returning	1
from	1
the	1
review,	1
Kutuzov	1
took	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
into	1
his	1
private	1
room	1
and,	1
calling	1
his	1
adjutant,	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
papers	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
their	1
arrival,	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
advanced	1
army.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
required	1
papers.	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
plan	1
was	1
spread	1
out.	1
	1
"Ah!..."	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
glancing	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
this	1
exclamation	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
the	1
adjutant	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
conversation	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,"	1
said	1
he	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
elegance	1
of	1
expression	1
and	1
intonation	1
that	1
obliged	1
one	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
each	1
deliberately	1
spoken	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
listened	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
voice.	1
"All	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
General,	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
matter	1
depended	1
on	1
my	1
personal	1
wishes,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
joined	1
the	1
archduke.	1
And	1
believe	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
honour	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
personally	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
supreme	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
informed	1
and	1
more	1
skillful	1
general--of	1
whom	1
Austria	1
has	1
so	1
many--and	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
all	1
this	1
heavy	1
responsibility.	1
But	1
circumstances	1
are	1
sometimes	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
us,	1
General."	1
	1
And	1
Kutuzov	1
smiled	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say,	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
at	1
liberty	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
don't	1
even	1
care	1
whether	1
you	1
do	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
grounds	1
for	1
telling	1
me	1
so.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
point."	1
	1
The	1
Austrian	1
general	1
looked	1
dissatisfied,	1
but	1
had	1
no	1
option	1
but	1
to	1
reply	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,"	1
he	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
querulous	1
and	1
angry	1
tone	1
that	1
contrasted	1
with	1
his	1
flattering	1
words,	1
"on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
your	1
excellency's	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
action	1
is	1
highly	1
valued	1
by	1
His	1
Majesty;	1
but	1
we	1
think	1
the	1
present	1
delay	1
is	1
depriving	1
the	1
splendid	1
Russian	1
troops	1
and	1
their	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
laurels	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
win	1
in	1
their	1
battles,"	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
evidently	1
prearranged	1
sentence.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
bowed	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
smile.	1
	1
"But	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
conviction,	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
with	1
which	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
has	1
honored	1
me,	1
I	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
Austrian	1
troops,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
so	1
skillful	1
a	1
leader	1
as	1
General	1
Mack,	1
have	1
by	1
now	1
already	1
gained	1
a	1
decisive	1
victory	1
and	1
no	1
longer	1
need	1
our	1
aid,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned.	1
Though	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
definite	1
news	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
defeat,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
circumstances	1
confirming	1
the	1
unfavorable	1
rumors	1
that	1
were	1
afloat,	1
and	1
so	1
Kutuzov's	1
suggestion	1
of	1
an	1
Austrian	1
victory	1
sounded	1
much	1
like	1
irony.	1
But	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
on	1
blandly	1
smiling	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
expression,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
suppose	1
so.	1
And,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
Mack's	1
army	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
and	1
stated	1
strategically	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
very	1
favorable.	1
	1
"Give	1
me	1
that	1
letter,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Please	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
it"--and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile	1
about	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
the	1
following	1
passage,	1
in	1
German,	1
from	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand's	1
letter:	1
	1
We	1
have	1
fully	1
concentrated	1
forces	1
of	1
nearly	1
seventy	1
thousand	1
men	1
with	1
which	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
defeat	1
the	1
enemy	1
should	1
he	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech.	1
Also,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
masters	1
of	1
Ulm,	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
commanding	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
so	1
that	1
should	1
the	1
enemy	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
Lech,	1
we	1
can	1
cross	1
the	1
Danube,	1
throw	1
ourselves	1
on	1
his	1
line	1
of	1
communications,	1
recross	1
the	1
river	1
lower	1
down,	1
and	1
frustrate	1
his	1
intention	1
should	1
he	1
try	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
whole	1
force	1
against	1
our	1
faithful	1
ally.	1
We	1
shall	1
therefore	1
confidently	1
await	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Russian	1
army	1
will	1
be	1
fully	1
equipped,	1
and	1
shall	1
then,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
it,	1
easily	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
enemy	1
the	1
fate	1
he	1
deserves.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
on	1
finishing	1
this	1
paragraph	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
mildly	1
and	1
attentively.	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
wise	1
maxim	1
your	1
excellency,	1
advising	1
one	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
worst,"	1
said	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
jests	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
business.	1
He	1
involuntarily	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
aide-de-camp.	1
	1
"Excuse	1
me,	1
General,"	1
interrupted	1
Kutuzov,	1
also	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Look	1
here,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
get	1
from	1
Kozlovski	1
all	1
the	1
reports	1
from	1
our	1
scouts.	1
Here	1
are	1
two	1
letters	1
from	1
Count	1
Nostitz	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
one	1
from	1
His	1
Highness	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
these,"	1
he	1
said,	1
handing	1
him	1
several	1
papers,	1
"make	1
a	1
neat	1
memorandum	1
in	1
French	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
showing	1
all	1
the	1
news	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army,	1
and	1
then	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
excellency."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
having	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
but	1
also	1
what	1
Kutuzov	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
He	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
both,	1
stepped	1
softly	1
over	1
the	1
carpet	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room.	1
	1
Though	1
not	1
much	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
since	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
left	1
Russia,	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
during	1
that	1
period.	1
In	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face,	1
in	1
his	1
movements,	1
in	1
his	1
walk,	1
scarcely	1
a	1
trace	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
affected	1
languor	1
and	1
indolence.	1
He	1
now	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
impression	1
he	1
makes	1
on	1
others,	1
but	1
is	1
occupied	1
with	1
agreeable	1
and	1
interesting	1
work.	1
His	1
face	1
expressed	1
more	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
himself	1
and	1
those	1
around	1
him,	1
his	1
smile	1
and	1
glance	1
were	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
attractive.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
received	1
him	1
very	1
kindly,	1
promised	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
him,	1
distinguished	1
him	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
adjutants,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
to	1
Vienna	1
and	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
more	1
serious	1
commissions.	1
From	1
Vienna	1
Kutuzov	1
wrote	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
comrade,	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
father.	1
	1
Your	1
son	1
bids	1
fair	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
officer	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
industry,	1
firmness,	1
and	1
expedition.	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
fortunate	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
subordinate	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
On	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
among	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
generally,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
two	1
quite	1
opposite	1
reputations.	1
Some,	1
a	1
minority,	1
acknowledged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
different	1
from	1
themselves	1
and	1
from	1
everyone	1
else,	1
expected	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
him,	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
admired,	1
and	1
imitated	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
pleasant.	1
Others,	1
the	1
majority,	1
disliked	1
him	1
and	1
considered	1
him	1
conceited,	1
cold,	1
and	1
disagreeable.	1
But	1
among	1
these	1
people	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stand	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
respected	1
and	1
even	1
feared	1
him.	1
	1
Coming	1
out	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
room	1
into	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
papers	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
comrade,	1
the	1
aide-de-camp	1
on	1
duty,	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
a	1
book.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Prince?"	1
asked	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
ordered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
memorandum	1
explaining	1
why	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
advancing."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"Any	1
news	1
from	1
Mack?"	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
beaten,	1
news	1
would	1
have	1
come."	1
	1
"Probably,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
outer	1
door.	1
	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
a	1
tall	1
Austrian	1
general	1
in	1
a	1
greatcoat,	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Maria	1
Theresa	1
on	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
black	1
bandage	1
round	1
his	1
head,	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
just	1
arrived,	1
entered	1
quickly,	1
slamming	1
the	1
door.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
short.	1
	1
"Commander	1
in	1
Chief	1
Kutuzov?"	1
said	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
general	1
speaking	1
quickly	1
with	1
a	1
harsh	1
German	1
accent,	1
looking	1
to	1
both	1
sides	1
and	1
advancing	1
straight	1
toward	1
the	1
inner	1
door.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
said	1
Kozlovski,	1
going	1
hurriedly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
general	1
and	1
blocking	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
"Whom	1
shall	1
I	1
announce?"	1
	1
The	1
unknown	1
general	1
looked	1
disdainfully	1
down	1
at	1
Kozlovski,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
surprised	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
"The	1
commander-in-chief	1
is	1
engaged,"	1
repeated	1
Kozlovski	1
calmly.	1
	1
The	1
general's	1
face	1
clouded,	1
his	1
lips	1
quivered	1
and	1
trembled.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
notebook,	1
hurriedly	1
scribbled	1
something	1
in	1
pencil,	1
tore	1
out	1
the	1
leaf,	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Kozlovski,	1
stepped	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
threw	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chair,	1
gazing	1
at	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
asking,	1
"Why	1
do	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
me?"	1
Then	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
head,	1
stretched	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
immediately,	1
with	1
affected	1
indifference,	1
began	1
to	1
hum	1
to	1
himself,	1
producing	1
a	1
queer	1
sound	1
which	1
immediately	1
broke	1
off.	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
room	1
opened	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
The	1
general	1
with	1
the	1
bandaged	1
head	1
bent	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
some	1
danger,	1
and,	1
making	1
long,	1
quick	1
strides	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
legs,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"Vous	1
voyez	1
le	1
malheureux	1
Mack,"	1
he	1
uttered	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
voice.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
face	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
immobile	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
Then	1
wrinkles	1
ran	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
wave	1
and	1
his	1
forehead	1
became	1
smooth	1
again,	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
respectfully,	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
silently	1
let	1
Mack	1
enter	1
his	1
room	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
himself	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
report	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
circulated	1
that	1
the	1
Austrians	1
had	1
been	1
beaten	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
had	1
surrendered	1
at	1
Ulm	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
correct.	1
Within	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
adjutants	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
in	1
various	1
directions	1
with	1
orders	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
inactive,	1
would	1
also	1
soon	1
have	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
staff	1
officers	1
whose	1
chief	1
interest	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Mack	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
disaster	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
half	1
the	1
campaign	1
was	1
lost,	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army's	1
position,	1
and	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
what	1
awaited	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
play.	1
Involuntarily	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
joyful	1
agitation	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
humiliation	1
of	1
arrogant	1
Austria	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
week's	1
time	1
he	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
see	1
and	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
Russian	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
since	1
Suvorov	1
met	1
them.	1
He	1
feared	1
that	1
Bonaparte's	1
genius	1
might	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
could	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
hero	1
being	1
disgraced.	1
	1
Excited	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
these	1
thoughts	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
room	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
wrote	1
every	1
day.	1
In	1
the	1
corridor	1
he	1
met	1
Nesvitski,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
shared	1
a	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov;	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
usual	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
so	1
glum?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski	1
noticing	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
"There's	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
gay	1
about,"	1
answered	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
met	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
there	1
came	1
toward	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
corridor,	1
Strauch,	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general	1
who	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
provisioning	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
who	1
had	1
arrived	1
the	1
previous	1
evening.	1
There	1
was	1
room	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
corridor	1
for	1
the	1
generals	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
three	1
officers	1
quite	1
easily,	1
but	1
Zherkov,	1
pushing	1
Nesvitski	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
arm,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
breathless	1
voice,	1
	1
"They're	1
coming!...	1
they're	1
coming!...	1
Stand	1
aside,	1
make	1
way,	1
please	1
make	1
way!"	1
	1
The	1
generals	1
were	1
passing	1
by,	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
embarrassing	1
attentions.	1
On	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
wag	1
Zherkov	1
there	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
a	1
stupid	1
smile	1
of	1
glee	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
German,	1
stepping	1
forward	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
scraped	1
first	1
with	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
awkwardly,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
at	1
a	1
dancing	1
lesson.	1
	1
The	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
severely	1
but,	1
seeing	1
the	1
seriousness	1
of	1
his	1
stupid	1
smile,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
moment's	1
attention.	1
He	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
listening.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
congratulate	1
you.	1
General	1
Mack	1
has	1
arrived,	1
quite	1
well,	1
only	1
a	1
little	1
bruised	1
just	1
here,"	1
he	1
added,	1
pointing	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
smile	1
to	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
frowned,	1
turned	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
	1
"Gott,	1
wie	1
naiv!"	1
*	1
said	1
he	1
angrily,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
few	1
steps.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Good	1
God,	1
what	1
simplicity!"	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
threw	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
but	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
still	1
paler,	1
pushed	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
look	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Zherkov.	1
The	1
nervous	1
irritation	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Mack,	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
defeat,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
lay	1
before	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
found	1
vent	1
in	1
anger	1
at	1
Zherkov's	1
untimely	1
jest.	1
	1
"If	1
you,	1
sir,	1
choose	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
buffoon	1
of	1
yourself,"	1
he	1
said	1
sharply,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
trembling	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
"I	1
can't	1
prevent	1
your	1
doing	1
so;	1
but	1
I	1
warn	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
dare	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fool	1
in	1
my	1
presence,	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
behave	1
yourself."	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
Zherkov	1
were	1
so	1
surprised	1
by	1
this	1
outburst	1
that	1
they	1
gazed	1
at	1
Bolkonski	1
silently	1
with	1
wide-open	1
eyes.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?	1
I	1
only	1
congratulated	1
them,"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
jesting	1
with	1
you;	1
please	1
be	1
silent!"	1
cried	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
taking	1
Nesvitski's	1
arm	1
he	1
left	1
Zherkov,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Come,	1
what's	1
the	1
matter,	1
old	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
trying	1
to	1
soothe	1
him.	1
	1
"What's	1
the	1
matter?"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
standing	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
excitement.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand	1
that	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
officers	1
serving	1
our	1
Tsar	1
and	1
our	1
country,	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
successes	1
and	1
grieving	1
at	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
our	1
common	1
cause,	1
or	1
we	1
are	1
merely	1
lackeys	1
who	1
care	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
master's	1
business.	1
Quarante	1
mille	1
hommes	1
massacres	1
et	1
l'armee	1
de	1
nos	1
allies	1
detruite,	1
et	1
vous	1
trouvez	1
la	1
le	1
mot	1
pour	1
rire,"	1
*	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
strengthening	1
his	1
views	1
by	1
this	1
French	1
sentence.	1
"C'est	1
bien	1
pour	1
un	1
garcon	1
de	1
rien	1
comme	1
cet	1
individu	1
dont	1
vous	1
avez	1
fait	1
un	1
ami,	1
mais	1
pas	1
pour	1
vous,	1
pas	1
pour	1
vous.	1
*(2)	1
Only	1
a	1
hobbledehoy	1
could	1
amuse	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
way,"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
Russian--but	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
accent--having	1
noticed	1
that	1
Zherkov	1
could	1
still	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Forty	1
thousand	1
men	1
massacred	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
our	1
allies	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
jesting!"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
that	1
good-for-nothing	1
fellow	1
of	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
friend,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
you,	1
not	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
He	1
waited	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
cornet	1
would	1
answer,	1
but	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
corridor.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
The	1
Pavlograd	1
Hussars	1
were	1
stationed	1
two	1
miles	1
from	1
Braunau.	1
The	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
cadet	1
was	1
quartered	1
in	1
the	1
German	1
village	1
of	1
Salzeneck.	1
The	1
best	1
quarters	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
were	1
assigned	1
to	1
cavalry-captain	1
Denisov,	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
known	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
cavalry	1
division	1
as	1
Vaska	1
Denisov.	1
Cadet	1
Rostov,	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
overtaken	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
Poland,	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander.	1
	1
On	1
October	1
11,	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
astir	1
at	1
headquarters	1
over	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Mack's	1
defeat,	1
the	1
camp	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
this	1
squadron	1
was	1
proceeding	1
as	1
usual.	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
losing	1
at	1
cards	1
all	1
night,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
home	1
when	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
back	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
from	1
a	1
foraging	1
expedition.	1
Rostov	1
in	1
his	1
cadet	1
uniform,	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch,	1
swung	1
his	1
leg	1
over	1
the	1
saddle	1
with	1
a	1
supple	1
youthful	1
movement,	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
stirrup	1
as	1
if	1
loathe	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
sprang	1
down	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
orderly.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Bondarenko,	1
dear	1
friend!"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
who	1
rushed	1
up	1
headlong	1
to	1
the	1
horse.	1
"Walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
that	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
cordiality	1
which	1
goodhearted	1
young	1
people	1
show	1
to	1
everyone	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
happy.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
the	1
Ukrainian	1
gaily,	1
tossing	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Mind,	1
walk	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
well!"	1
	1
Another	1
hussar	1
also	1
rushed	1
toward	1
the	1
horse,	1
but	1
Bondarenko	1
had	1
already	1
thrown	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
the	1
snaffle	1
bridle	1
over	1
the	1
horse's	1
head.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
cadet	1
was	1
liberal	1
with	1
his	1
tips	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
paid	1
to	1
serve	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
patted	1
the	1
horse's	1
neck	1
and	1
then	1
his	1
flank,	1
and	1
lingered	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
	1
"Splendid!	1
What	1
a	1
horse	1
he	1
will	1
be!"	1
he	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
saber,	1
his	1
spurs	1
jingling,	1
he	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
porch.	1
His	1
landlord,	1
who	1
in	1
a	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
a	1
pointed	1
cap,	1
pitchfork	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
clearing	1
manure	1
from	1
the	1
cowhouse,	1
looked	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
immediately	1
brightened	1
on	1
seeing	1
Rostov.	1
"Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!	1
Schon	1
gut	1
Morgen!"	1
*	1
he	1
said	1
winking	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
to	1
greet	1
the	1
young	1
man.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!	1
A	1
very	1
good	1
morning!"	1
	1
"Schon	1
fleissig?"	1
*	1
said	1
Rostov	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
gay	1
brotherly	1
smile	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
eager	1
face.	1
"Hoch	1
Oestreicher!	1
Hoch	1
Russen!	1
Kaiser	1
Alexander	1
hoch!"	1
*(2)	1
said	1
he,	1
quoting	1
words	1
often	1
repeated	1
by	1
the	1
German	1
landlord.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Busy	1
already?"	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
"Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Austrians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Russians!	1
Hurrah	1
for	1
Emperor	1
Alexander!"	1
	1
The	1
German	1
laughed,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cowshed,	1
pulled	1
off	1
his	1
cap,	1
and	1
waving	1
it	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
cried:	1
	1
"Und	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt	1
hoch!"	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"And	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
world!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
waved	1
his	1
cap	1
above	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
German	1
and	1
cried	1
laughing,	1
"Und	1
vivat	1
die	1
ganze	1
Welt!"	1
Though	1
neither	1
the	1
German	1
cleaning	1
his	1
cowshed	1
nor	1
Rostov	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
platoon	1
from	1
foraging	1
for	1
hay	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
rejoicing,	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
joyful	1
delight	1
and	1
brotherly	1
love,	1
wagged	1
their	1
heads	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
affection,	1
and	1
parted	1
smiling,	1
the	1
German	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
cowshed	1
and	1
Rostov	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
cottage	1
he	1
occupied	1
with	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
your	1
master?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Lavrushka,	1
Denisov's	1
orderly,	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
regiment	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
rogue.	1
	1
"Hasn't	1
been	1
in	1
since	1
the	1
evening.	1
Must	1
have	1
been	1
losing,"	1
answered	1
Lavrushka.	1
"I	1
know	1
by	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
wins	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
early	1
to	1
brag	1
about	1
it,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
stays	1
out	1
till	1
morning	1
it	1
means	1
he's	1
lost	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
rage.	1
Will	1
you	1
have	1
coffee?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
bring	1
some."	1
	1
Ten	1
minutes	1
later	1
Lavrushka	1
brought	1
the	1
coffee.	1
"He's	1
coming!"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Now	1
for	1
trouble!"	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
saw	1
Denisov	1
coming	1
home.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face,	1
sparkling	1
black	1
eyes,	1
and	1
black	1
tousled	1
mustache	1
and	1
hair.	1
He	1
wore	1
an	1
unfastened	1
cloak,	1
wide	1
breeches	1
hanging	1
down	1
in	1
creases,	1
and	1
a	1
crumpled	1
shako	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch	1
gloomily,	1
hanging	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"Lavwuska!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
loudly	1
and	1
angrily,	1
"take	1
it	1
off,	1
blockhead!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
it	1
off,"	1
replied	1
Lavrushka's	1
voice.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you're	1
up	1
already,"	1
said	1
Denisov,	1
entering	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Long	1
ago,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
hay,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
Fraulein	1
Mathilde."	1
	1
"Weally!	1
And	1
I've	1
been	1
losing,	1
bwother.	1
I	1
lost	1
yesterday	1
like	1
a	1
damned	1
fool!"	1
cried	1
Denisov,	1
not	1
pronouncing	1
his	1
r's.	1
"Such	1
ill	1
luck!	1
Such	1
ill	1
luck.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
left,	1
it	1
began	1
and	1
went	1
on.	1
Hullo	1
there!	1
Tea!"	1
	1
Puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
though	1
smiling,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
short	1
strong	1
teeth,	1
he	1
began	1
with	1
stubby	1
fingers	1
of	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
ruffle	1
up	1
his	1
thick	1
tangled	1
black	1
hair.	1
	1
"And	1
what	1
devil	1
made	1
me	1
go	1
to	1
that	1
wat?"	1
(an	1
officer	1
nicknamed	1
"the	1
rat")	1
he	1
said,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
whole	1
face	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
"Just	1
fancy,	1
he	1
didn't	1
let	1
me	1
win	1
a	1
single	1
cahd,	1
not	1
one	1
cahd."	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
lighted	1
pipe	1
that	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
him,	1
gripped	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
fist,	1
and	1
tapped	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
making	1
the	1
sparks	1
fly,	1
while	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout.	1
	1
"He	1
lets	1
one	1
win	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
collahs	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
one	1
doubles	1
it;	1
gives	1
the	1
singles	1
and	1
snatches	1
the	1
doubles!"	1
	1
He	1
scattered	1
the	1
burning	1
tobacco,	1
smashed	1
the	1
pipe,	1
and	1
threw	1
it	1
away.	1
Then	1
he	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
looked	1
cheerfully	1
with	1
his	1
glittering,	1
black	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"If	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
women	1
here;	1
but	1
there's	1
nothing	1
foh	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
dwink.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
to	1
fighting	1
soon.	1
Hullo,	1
who's	1
there?"	1
he	1
said,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
tread	1
of	1
heavy	1
boots	1
and	1
the	1
clinking	1
of	1
spurs	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop,	1
and	1
a	1
respectful	1
cough.	1
	1
"The	1
squadron	1
quartermaster!"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
Denisov's	1
face	1
puckered	1
still	1
more.	1
	1
"Wetched!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
throwing	1
down	1
a	1
purse	1
with	1
some	1
gold	1
in	1
it.	1
"Wostov,	1
deah	1
fellow,	1
just	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
there	1
is	1
left	1
and	1
shove	1
the	1
purse	1
undah	1
the	1
pillow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
quartermaster.	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
and,	1
mechanically	1
arranging	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
new	1
coins	1
in	1
separate	1
piles,	1
began	1
counting	1
them.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Telyanin!	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
They	1
plucked	1
me	1
last	1
night,"	1
came	1
Denisov's	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
	1
"Where?	1
At	1
Bykov's,	1
at	1
the	1
rat's...	1
I	1
knew	1
it,"	1
replied	1
a	1
piping	1
voice,	1
and	1
Lieutenant	1
Telyanin,	1
a	1
small	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
squadron,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Rostov	1
thrust	1
the	1
purse	1
under	1
the	1
pillow	1
and	1
shook	1
the	1
damp	1
little	1
hand	1
which	1
was	1
offered	1
him.	1
Telyanin	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
been	1
transferred	1
from	1
the	1
Guards	1
just	1
before	1
this	1
campaign.	1
He	1
behaved	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
liked;	1
Rostov	1
especially	1
detested	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
overcome	1
or	1
conceal	1
his	1
groundless	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
cavalryman,	1
how	1
is	1
my	1
Rook	1
behaving?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
(Rook	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
horse	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
sold	1
to	1
Rostov.)	1
	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
never	1
looked	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
face;	1
his	1
eyes	1
continually	1
wandered	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
you	1
riding	1
this	1
morning..."	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
he's	1
all	1
right,	1
a	1
good	1
horse,"	1
answered	1
Rostov,	1
though	1
the	1
horse	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
seven	1
hundred	1
rubbles	1
was	1
not	1
worth	1
half	1
that	1
sum.	1
"He's	1
begun	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
little	1
lame	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
foreleg,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
"The	1
hoof's	1
cracked!	1
That's	1
nothing.	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
show	1
you	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
rivet	1
to	1
use."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
please	1
do,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I'll	1
show	1
you,	1
I'll	1
show	1
you!	1
It's	1
not	1
a	1
secret.	1
And	1
it's	1
a	1
horse	1
you'll	1
thank	1
me	1
for."	1
	1
"Then	1
I'll	1
have	1
it	1
brought	1
round,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
wishing	1
to	1
avoid	1
Telyanin,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
Denisov,	1
with	1
a	1
pipe,	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
threshold	1
facing	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
who	1
was	1
reporting	1
to	1
him.	1
On	1
seeing	1
Rostov,	1
Denisov	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
pointing	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
thumb	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting,	1
he	1
frowned	1
and	1
gave	1
a	1
shudder	1
of	1
disgust.	1
	1
"Ugh!	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
that	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said,	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
quartermaster's	1
presence.	1
	1
Rostov	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
"Nor	1
do	1
I,	1
but	1
what's	1
one	1
to	1
do?"	1
and,	1
having	1
given	1
his	1
order,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
Telyanin	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
indolent	1
pose	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
rubbing	1
his	1
small	1
white	1
hands.	1
	1
"Well	1
there	1
certainly	1
are	1
disgusting	1
people,"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
as	1
he	1
entered.	1
	1
"Have	1
you	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
horse?"	1
asked	1
Telyanin,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
looking	1
carelessly	1
about	1
him.	1
	1
"I	1
have."	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go	1
ourselves.	1
I	1
only	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
ask	1
Denisov	1
about	1
yesterday's	1
order.	1
Have	1
you	1
got	1
it,	1
Denisov?"	1
	1
"Not	1
yet.	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
teach	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
how	1
to	1
shoe	1
a	1
horse,"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
They	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
stable.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
explained	1
how	1
to	1
rivet	1
the	1
hoof	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
quarters.	1
	1
When	1
Rostov	1
went	1
back	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
a	1
sausage	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Denisov	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
scratching	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
on	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper.	1
He	1
looked	1
gloomily	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
am	1
witing	1
to	1
her."	1
	1
He	1
leaned	1
his	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and,	1
evidently	1
glad	1
of	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
say	1
quicker	1
in	1
words	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
write,	1
told	1
Rostov	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
his	1
letter.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
fwiend,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"we	1
sleep	1
when	1
we	1
don't	1
love.	1
We	1
are	1
childwen	1
of	1
the	1
dust...	1
but	1
one	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
a	1
God,	1
one	1
is	1
pua'	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
cweation...	1
Who's	1
that	1
now?	1
Send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
I'm	1
busy!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka,	1
who	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
abashed.	1
	1
"Who	1
should	1
it	1
be?	1
You	1
yourself	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
It's	1
the	1
quartermaster	1
for	1
the	1
money."	1
	1
Denisov	1
frowned	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
shout	1
some	1
reply	1
but	1
stopped.	1
	1
"Wetched	1
business,"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself.	1
"How	1
much	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
puhse?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Seven	1
new	1
and	1
three	1
old	1
imperials."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
it's	1
wetched!	1
Well,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
standing	1
there	1
for,	1
you	1
sca'cwow?	1
Call	1
the	1
quahtehmasteh,"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Please,	1
Denisov,	1
let	1
me	1
lend	1
you	1
some:	1
I	1
have	1
some,	1
you	1
know,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"Don't	1
like	1
bowwowing	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
fellows,	1
I	1
don't,"	1
growled	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
won't	1
accept	1
money	1
from	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
comrade,	1
you	1
will	1
offend	1
me.	1
Really	1
I	1
have	1
some,"	1
Rostov	1
repeated.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
tell	1
you."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bed	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
purse	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
pillow.	1
	1
"Where	1
have	1
you	1
put	1
it,	1
Wostov?"	1
	1
"Under	1
the	1
lower	1
pillow."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
there."	1
	1
Denisov	1
threw	1
both	1
pillows	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
miwacle."	1
	1
"Wait,	1
haven't	1
you	1
dropped	1
it?"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
picking	1
up	1
the	1
pillows	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
shaking	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
pulled	1
off	1
the	1
quilt	1
and	1
shook	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
can	1
I	1
have	1
forgotten?	1
No,	1
I	1
remember	1
thinking	1
that	1
you	1
kept	1
it	1
under	1
your	1
head	1
like	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
put	1
it	1
just	1
here.	1
Where	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
to	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"I	1
haven't	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
where	1
you	1
put	1
it."	1
	1
"But	1
it	1
isn't?..."	1
	1
"You're	1
always	1
like	1
that;	1
you	1
thwow	1
a	1
thing	1
down	1
anywhere	1
and	1
forget	1
it.	1
Feel	1
in	1
your	1
pockets."	1
	1
"No,	1
if	1
I	1
hadn't	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
treasure,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"but	1
I	1
remember	1
putting	1
it	1
there."	1
	1
Lavrushka	1
turned	1
all	1
the	1
bedding	1
over,	1
looked	1
under	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
table,	1
searched	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Denisov	1
silently	1
watched	1
Lavrushka's	1
movements,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
arms	1
in	1
surprise	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
Denisov	1
glanced	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Wostov,	1
you've	1
not	1
been	1
playing	1
schoolboy	1
twicks..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
Denisov's	1
gaze	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
instantly	1
dropped	1
them	1
again.	1
All	1
the	1
blood	1
which	1
had	1
seemed	1
congested	1
somewhere	1
below	1
his	1
throat	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
eyes.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
draw	1
breath.	1
	1
"And	1
there	1
hasn't	1
been	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
and	1
yourselves.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
here	1
somewhere,"	1
said	1
Lavrushka.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
you	1
devil's	1
puppet,	1
look	1
alive	1
and	1
hunt	1
for	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
suddenly,	1
turning	1
purple	1
and	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
threatening	1
gesture.	1
"If	1
the	1
purse	1
isn't	1
found	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you,	1
I'll	1
flog	1
you	1
all."	1
	1
Rostov,	1
his	1
eyes	1
avoiding	1
Denisov,	1
began	1
buttoning	1
his	1
coat,	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
saber,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
cap.	1
	1
"I	1
must	1
have	1
that	1
purse,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
shaking	1
his	1
orderly	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
knocking	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
	1
"Denisov,	1
let	1
him	1
alone,	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
going	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Denisov	1
paused,	1
thought	1
a	1
moment,	1
and,	1
evidently	1
understanding	1
what	1
Rostov	1
hinted	1
at,	1
seized	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Nonsense!"	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
the	1
veins	1
on	1
his	1
forehead	1
and	1
neck	1
stood	1
out	1
like	1
cords.	1
"You	1
are	1
mad,	1
I	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
won't	1
allow	1
it.	1
The	1
purse	1
is	1
here!	1
I'll	1
flay	1
this	1
scoundwel	1
alive,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it,"	1
repeated	1
Rostov	1
in	1
an	1
unsteady	1
voice,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
don't	1
you	1
dahe	1
to	1
do	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
cadet	1
to	1
restrain	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
pulled	1
away	1
his	1
arm	1
and,	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
anger	1
as	1
though	1
Denisov	1
were	1
his	1
worst	1
enemy,	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
directly	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
you're	1
saying?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice.	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
except	1
myself.	1
So	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
then..."	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
finish,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
may	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
you	1
and	1
evewybody,"	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
Rostov	1
heard.	1
	1
Rostov	1
went	1
to	1
Telyanin's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"The	1
master	1
is	1
not	1
in,	1
he's	1
gone	1
to	1
headquarters,"	1
said	1
Telyanin's	1
orderly.	1
"Has	1
something	1
happened?"	1
he	1
added,	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
cadet's	1
troubled	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
nothing."	1
	1
"You've	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1
him,"	1
said	1
the	1
orderly.	1
	1
The	1
headquarters	1
were	1
situated	1
two	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
Salzeneck,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
returning	1
home,	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
there.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
inn	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
which	1
the	1
officers	1
frequented.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
saw	1
Telyanin's	1
horse	1
at	1
the	1
porch.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
sitting	1
over	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
sausages	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
you've	1
come	1
here	1
too,	1
young	1
man!"	1
he	1
said,	1
smiling	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows.	1
	1
"Yes,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
nearest	1
table.	1
	1
Both	1
were	1
silent.	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
Germans	1
and	1
a	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
No	1
one	1
spoke	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
heard	1
were	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
knives	1
and	1
the	1
munching	1
of	1
the	1
lieutenant.	1
	1
When	1
Telyanin	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
lunch	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
double	1
purse	1
and,	1
drawing	1
its	1
rings	1
aside	1
with	1
his	1
small,	1
white,	1
turned-up	1
fingers,	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
gold	1
imperial,	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
waiter.	1
	1
"Please	1
be	1
quick,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
coin	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
Rostov	1
rose	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
"Allow	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
purse,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
almost	1
inaudible,	1
voice.	1
	1
With	1
shifting	1
eyes	1
but	1
eyebrows	1
still	1
raised,	1
Telyanin	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
purse.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it's	1
a	1
nice	1
purse.	1
Yes,	1
yes,"	1
he	1
said,	1
growing	1
suddenly	1
pale,	1
and	1
added,	1
"Look	1
at	1
it,	1
young	1
man."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
examined	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Telyanin.	1
The	1
lieutenant	1
was	1
looking	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
way	1
and	1
suddenly	1
seemed	1
to	1
grow	1
very	1
merry.	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
Vienna	1
I'll	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
but	1
in	1
these	1
wretched	1
little	1
towns	1
there's	1
nowhere	1
to	1
spend	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Well,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it,	1
young	1
man,	1
I'm	1
going."	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
speak.	1
	1
"And	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
lunch	1
too?	1
They	1
feed	1
you	1
quite	1
decently	1
here,"	1
continued	1
Telyanin.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
it."	1
	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
purse.	1
Rostov	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
it.	1
Telyanin	1
took	1
the	1
purse	1
and	1
began	1
carelessly	1
slipping	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
with	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
lifted	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
slightly	1
open,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
I	1
am	1
putting	1
my	1
purse	1
in	1
my	1
pocket	1
and	1
that's	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
else's	1
business."	1
	1
"Well,	1
young	1
man?"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sigh,	1
and	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
lifted	1
brows	1
he	1
glanced	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
eyes.	1
	1
Some	1
flash	1
as	1
of	1
an	1
electric	1
spark	1
shot	1
from	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
back,	1
and	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
	1
"Come	1
here,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
arm	1
and	1
almost	1
dragging	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
"That	1
money	1
is	1
Denisov's;	1
you	1
took	1
it..."	1
he	1
whispered	1
just	1
above	1
Telyanin's	1
ear.	1
	1
"What?	1
What?	1
How	1
dare	1
you?	1
What?"	1
said	1
Telyanin.	1
	1
But	1
these	1
words	1
came	1
like	1
a	1
piteous,	1
despairing	1
cry	1
and	1
an	1
entreaty	1
for	1
pardon.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Rostov	1
heard	1
them,	1
an	1
enormous	1
load	1
of	1
doubt	1
fell	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
began	1
to	1
pity	1
the	1
miserable	1
man	1
who	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
task	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
completed.	1
	1
"Heaven	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
the	1
people	1
here	1
may	1
imagine,"	1
muttered	1
Telyanin,	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
moving	1
toward	1
a	1
small	1
empty	1
room.	1
"We	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
explanation..."	1
	1
"I	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
shall	1
prove	1
it,"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I..."	1
	1
Every	1
muscle	1
of	1
Telyanin's	1
pale,	1
terrified	1
face	1
began	1
to	1
quiver,	1
his	1
eyes	1
still	1
shifted	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
downward	1
look	1
not	1
rising	1
to	1
Rostov's	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
sobs	1
were	1
audible.	1
	1
"Count!...	1
Don't	1
ruin	1
a	1
young	1
fellow...	1
here	1
is	1
this	1
wretched	1
money,	1
take	1
it..."	1
He	1
threw	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
old	1
father	1
and	1
mother!..."	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
avoiding	1
Telyanin's	1
eyes,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
then	1
retraced	1
his	1
steps.	1
"O	1
God,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
"how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
it?"	1
	1
"Count..."	1
said	1
Telyanin	1
drawing	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Don't	1
touch	1
me,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
drawing	1
back.	1
"If	1
you	1
need	1
it,	1
take	1
the	1
money,"	1
and	1
he	1
threw	1
the	1
purse	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
That	1
same	1
evening	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
animated	1
discussion	1
among	1
the	1
squadron's	1
officers	1
in	1
Denisov's	1
quarters.	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Rostov,	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
apologize	1
to	1
the	1
colonel!"	1
said	1
a	1
tall,	1
grizzly-haired	1
staff	1
captain,	1
with	1
enormous	1
mustaches	1
and	1
many	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
large	1
features,	1
to	1
Rostov	1
who	1
was	1
crimson	1
with	1
excitement.	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
captain,	1
Kirsten,	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
for	1
affairs	1
of	1
honor	1
and	1
had	1
twice	1
regained	1
his	1
commission.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
allow	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
liar!"	1
cried	1
Rostov.	1
"He	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
lied,	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
lied.	1
And	1
there	1
it	1
rests.	1
He	1
may	1
keep	1
me	1
on	1
duty	1
every	1
day,	1
or	1
may	1
place	1
me	1
under	1
arrest,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
me	1
apologize,	1
because	1
if	1
he,	1
as	1
commander	1
of	1
this	1
regiment,	1
thinks	1
it	1
beneath	1
his	1
dignity	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction,	1
then..."	1
	1
"You	1
just	1
wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
and	1
listen,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
in	1
his	1
deep	1
bass,	1
calmly	1
stroking	1
his	1
long	1
mustache.	1
"You	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers	1
that	1
an	1
officer	1
has	1
stolen..."	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
other	1
officers.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
spoken	1
before	1
them,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
diplomatist.	1
That's	1
why	1
I	1
joined	1
the	1
hussars,	1
thinking	1
that	1
here	1
one	1
would	1
not	1
need	1
finesse;	1
and	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
lying--so	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
me	1
satisfaction..."	1
	1
"That's	1
all	1
right.	1
No	1
one	1
thinks	1
you	1
a	1
coward,	1
but	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point.	1
Ask	1
Denisov	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
for	1
a	1
cadet	1
to	1
demand	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
regimental	1
commander?"	1
	1
Denisov	1
sat	1
gloomily	1
biting	1
his	1
mustache	1
and	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation,	1
evidently	1
with	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
answered	1
the	1
staff	1
captain's	1
question	1
by	1
a	1
disapproving	1
shake	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"You	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
about	1
this	1
nasty	1
business	1
before	1
other	1
officers,"	1
continued	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
"and	1
Bogdanich"	1
(the	1
colonel	1
was	1
called	1
Bogdanich)	1
"shuts	1
you	1
up."	1
	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
shut	1
me	1
up,	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
telling	1
an	1
untruth."	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
and	1
you	1
talked	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nonsense	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
must	1
apologize."	1
	1
"Not	1
on	1
any	1
account!"	1
exclaimed	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
this	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
seriously	1
and	1
severely.	1
"You	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
apologize,	1
but,	1
man,	1
it's	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
him	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment--all	1
of	1
us--you're	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
round.	1
The	1
case	1
is	1
this:	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
thought	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
and	1
taken	1
advice;	1
but	1
no,	1
you	1
go	1
and	1
blurt	1
it	1
all	1
straight	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
officers.	1
Now	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
do?	1
Have	1
the	1
officer	1
tried	1
and	1
disgrace	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment?	1
Disgrace	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment	1
because	1
of	1
one	1
scoundrel?	1
Is	1
that	1
how	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
it?	1
We	1
don't	1
see	1
it	1
like	1
that.	1
And	1
Bogdanich	1
was	1
a	1
brick:	1
he	1
told	1
you	1
you	1
were	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
not	1
true.	1
It's	1
not	1
pleasant,	1
but	1
what's	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?	1
You	1
landed	1
yourself	1
in	1
it.	1
And	1
now,	1
when	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
smooth	1
the	1
thing	1
over,	1
some	1
conceit	1
prevents	1
your	1
apologizing,	1
and	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
public.	1
You	1
are	1
offended	1
at	1
being	1
put	1
on	1
duty	1
a	1
bit,	1
but	1
why	1
not	1
apologize	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
and	1
honorable	1
officer?	1
Whatever	1
Bogdanich	1
may	1
be,	1
anyway	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honorable	1
and	1
brave	1
old	1
colonel!	1
You're	1
quick	1
at	1
taking	1
offense,	1
but	1
you	1
don't	1
mind	1
disgracing	1
the	1
whole	1
regiment!"	1
The	1
staff	1
captain's	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
tremble.	1
"You	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
next	1
to	1
no	1
time,	1
my	1
lad,	1
you're	1
here	1
today	1
and	1
tomorrow	1
you'll	1
be	1
appointed	1
adjutant	1
somewhere	1
and	1
can	1
snap	1
your	1
fingers	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
'There	1
are	1
thieves	1
among	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
officers!'	1
But	1
it's	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
us!	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
right,	1
Denisov?	1
It's	1
not	1
the	1
same!"	1
	1
Denisov	1
remained	1
silent	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
but	1
occasionally	1
looked	1
with	1
his	1
glittering	1
black	1
eyes	1
at	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"You	1
value	1
your	1
own	1
pride	1
and	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
apologize,"	1
continued	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
"but	1
we	1
old	1
fellows,	1
who	1
have	1
grown	1
up	1
in	1
and,	1
God	1
willing,	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
we	1
prize	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
and	1
Bogdanich	1
knows	1
it.	1
Oh,	1
we	1
do	1
prize	1
it,	1
old	1
fellow!	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
right,	1
it's	1
not	1
right!	1
You	1
may	1
take	1
offense	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
stick	1
to	1
mother	1
truth.	1
It's	1
not	1
right!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
staff	1
captain	1
rose	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
Rostov.	1
	1
	1
"That's	1
twue,	1
devil	1
take	1
it!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
jumping	1
up.	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Wostov,	1
now	1
then!"	1
	1
Rostov,	1
growing	1
red	1
and	1
pale	1
alternately,	1
looked	1
first	1
at	1
one	1
officer	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"No,	1
gentlemen,	1
no...	1
you	1
mustn't	1
think...	1
I	1
quite	1
understand.	1
You're	1
wrong	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
of	1
me...	1
I...	1
for	1
me...	1
for	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
I'd...	1
Ah	1
well,	1
I'll	1
show	1
that	1
in	1
action,	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
flag...	1
Well,	1
never	1
mind,	1
it's	1
true	1
I'm	1
to	1
blame,	1
to	1
blame	1
all	1
round.	1
Well,	1
what	1
else	1
do	1
you	1
want?..."	1
	1
"Come,	1
that's	1
right,	1
Count!"	1
cried	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
turning	1
round	1
and	1
clapping	1
Rostov	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
with	1
his	1
big	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
"he's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow."	1
	1
"That's	1
better,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain,	1
beginning	1
to	1
address	1
Rostov	1
by	1
his	1
title,	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
recognition	1
of	1
his	1
confession.	1
"Go	1
and	1
apologize,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Yes,	1
go!"	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I'll	1
do	1
anything.	1
No	1
one	1
shall	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
me,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
in	1
an	1
imploring	1
voice,	1
"but	1
I	1
can't	1
apologize,	1
by	1
God	1
I	1
can't,	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
will!	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
apologize	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
boy	1
asking	1
forgiveness?"	1
	1
Denisov	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"It'll	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
you.	1
Bogdanich	1
is	1
vindictive	1
and	1
you'll	1
pay	1
for	1
your	1
obstinacy,"	1
said	1
Kirsten.	1
	1
"No,	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
it's	1
not	1
obstinacy!	1
I	1
can't	1
describe	1
the	1
feeling.	1
I	1
can't..."	1
	1
"Well,	1
it's	1
as	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain.	1
"And	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
that	1
scoundrel?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
weported	1
himself	1
sick,	1
he's	1
to	1
be	1
stwuck	1
off	1
the	1
list	1
tomowwow,"	1
muttered	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
an	1
illness,	1
there's	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
explaining	1
it,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
captain.	1
	1
"Illness	1
or	1
not,	1
he'd	1
better	1
not	1
cwoss	1
my	1
path.	1
I'd	1
kill	1
him!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
in	1
a	1
bloodthirsty	1
tone.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
Zherkov	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"What	1
brings	1
you	1
here?"	1
cried	1
the	1
officers	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
newcomer.	1
	1
"We're	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
action,	1
gentlemen!	1
Mack	1
has	1
surrendered	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army."	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
true!"	1
	1
"I've	1
seen	1
him	1
myself!"	1
	1
"What?	1
Saw	1
the	1
real	1
Mack?	1
With	1
hands	1
and	1
feet?"	1
	1
"Into	1
action!	1
Into	1
action!	1
Bring	1
him	1
a	1
bottle	1
for	1
such	1
news!	1
But	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
here?"	1
	1
"I've	1
been	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
all	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
that	1
devil,	1
Mack.	1
An	1
Austrian	1
general	1
complained	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
Mack's	1
arrival...	1
What's	1
the	1
matter,	1
Rostov?	1
You	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you'd	1
just	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hot	1
bath."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
we're	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
stew	1
here	1
these	1
last	1
two	1
days."	1
	1
The	1
regimental	1
adjutant	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
confirmed	1
the	1
news	1
brought	1
by	1
Zherkov.	1
They	1
were	1
under	1
orders	1
to	1
advance	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
"We're	1
going	1
into	1
action,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
"Well,	1
thank	1
God!	1
We've	1
been	1
sitting	1
here	1
too	1
long!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
fell	1
back	1
toward	1
Vienna,	1
destroying	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
bridges	1
over	1
the	1
rivers	1
Inn	1
(at	1
Braunau)	1
and	1
Traun	1
(near	1
Linz).	1
On	1
October	1
23	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
crossing	1
the	1
river	1
Enns.	1
At	1
midday	1
the	1
Russian	1
baggage	1
train,	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
columns	1
of	1
troops	1
were	1
defiling	1
through	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Enns	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
warm,	1
rainy,	1
autumnal	1
day.	1
The	1
wide	1
expanse	1
that	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
heights	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
batteries	1
stood	1
guarding	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
at	1
times	1
veiled	1
by	1
a	1
diaphanous	1
curtain	1
of	1
slanting	1
rain,	1
and	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
spread	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
far-distant	1
objects	1
could	1
be	1
clearly	1
seen	1
glittering	1
as	1
though	1
freshly	1
varnished.	1
Down	1
below,	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
with	1
its	1
white,	1
red-roofed	1
houses,	1
its	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
its	1
bridge,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
streamed	1
jostling	1
masses	1
of	1
Russian	1
troops.	1
At	1
the	1
bend	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
vessels,	1
an	1
island,	1
and	1
a	1
castle	1
with	1
a	1
park	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
confluence	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
and	1
the	1
Danube	1
became	1
visible,	1
and	1
the	1
rocky	1
left	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
covered	1
with	1
pine	1
forests,	1
with	1
a	1
mystic	1
background	1
of	1
green	1
treetops	1
and	1
bluish	1
gorges.	1
The	1
turrets	1
of	1
a	1
convent	1
stood	1
out	1
beyond	1
a	1
wild	1
virgin	1
pine	1
forest,	1
and	1
far	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
the	1
enemy's	1
horse	1
patrols	1
could	1
be	1
discerned.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
field	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
rearguard	1
stood	1
with	1
a	1
staff	1
officer,	1
scanning	1
the	1
country	1
through	1
his	1
fieldglass.	1
A	1
little	1
behind	1
them	1
Nesvitski,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
rearguard	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
carriage.	1
A	1
Cossack	1
who	1
accompanied	1
him	1
had	1
handed	1
him	1
a	1
knapsack	1
and	1
a	1
flask,	1
and	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
treating	1
some	1
officers	1
to	1
pies	1
and	1
real	1
doppelkummel.	1
The	1
officers	1
gladly	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
some	1
on	1
their	1
knees,	1
some	1
squatting	1
Turkish	1
fashion	1
on	1
the	1
wet	1
grass.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
prince	1
who	1
built	1
that	1
castle	1
was	1
no	1
fool.	1
It's	1
a	1
fine	1
place!	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
eating	1
anything,	1
gentlemen?"	1
Nesvitski	1
was	1
saying.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
Prince,"	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
staff	1
officer	1
of	1
such	1
importance.	1
"It's	1
a	1
lovely	1
place!	1
We	1
passed	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
park	1
and	1
saw	1
two	1
deer...	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
splendid	1
house!"	1
	1
"Look,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
another,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
dearly	1
liked	1
to	1
take	1
another	1
pie	1
but	1
felt	1
shy,	1
and	1
therefore	1
pretended	1
to	1
be	1
examining	1
the	1
countryside--"See,	1
our	1
infantrymen	1
have	1
already	1
got	1
there.	1
Look	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
meadow	1
behind	1
the	1
village,	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
dragging	1
something.	1
They'll	1
ransack	1
that	1
castle,"	1
he	1
remarked	1
with	1
evident	1
approval.	1
	1
"So	1
they	1
will,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"No,	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
like,"	1
added	1
he,	1
munching	1
a	1
pie	1
in	1
his	1
moist-lipped	1
handsome	1
mouth,	1
"would	1
be	1
to	1
slip	1
in	1
over	1
there."	1
	1
He	1
pointed	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
a	1
turreted	1
nunnery,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
and	1
gleamed.	1
	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
fine,	1
gentlemen!"	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Just	1
to	1
flutter	1
the	1
nuns	1
a	1
bit.	1
They	1
say	1
there	1
are	1
Italian	1
girls	1
among	1
them.	1
On	1
my	1
word	1
I'd	1
give	1
five	1
years	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
it!"	1
	1
"They	1
must	1
be	1
feeling	1
dull,	1
too,"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bolder	1
officers,	1
laughing.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
standing	1
in	1
front	1
pointed	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
who	1
looked	1
through	1
his	1
field	1
glass.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
so	1
it	1
is,	1
so	1
it	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
angrily,	1
lowering	1
the	1
field	1
glass	1
and	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
"so	1
it	1
is!	1
They'll	1
be	1
fired	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
crossing.	1
And	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
dawdling	1
there?"	1
	1
On	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
naked	1
eye,	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
battery	1
a	1
milk-white	1
cloud	1
arose.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
distant	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
shot,	1
and	1
our	1
troops	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
hurrying	1
to	1
the	1
crossing.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
rose,	1
puffing,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"Would	1
not	1
your	1
excellency	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
refreshment?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
bad	1
business,"	1
said	1
the	1
general	1
without	1
answering	1
him,	1
"our	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
wasting	1
time."	1
	1
"Hadn't	1
I	1
better	1
ride	1
over,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
please	1
do,"	1
answered	1
the	1
general,	1
and	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
order	1
that	1
had	1
already	1
once	1
been	1
given	1
in	1
detail:	1
"and	1
tell	1
the	1
hussars	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
cross	1
last	1
and	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
as	1
I	1
ordered;	1
and	1
the	1
inflammable	1
material	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
must	1
be	1
reinspected."	1
	1
"Very	1
good,"	1
answered	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
He	1
called	1
the	1
Cossack	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
knapsack	1
and	1
flask,	1
and	1
swung	1
his	1
heavy	1
person	1
easily	1
into	1
the	1
saddle.	1
	1
"I'll	1
really	1
call	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
nuns,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
watched	1
him	1
smilingly,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
winding	1
path	1
down	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
let's	1
see	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
will	1
carry,	1
Captain.	1
Just	1
try!"	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
turning	1
to	1
an	1
artillery	1
officer.	1
"Have	1
a	1
little	1
fun	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
time."	1
	1
"Crew,	1
to	1
your	1
guns!"	1
commanded	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
running	1
gaily	1
from	1
their	1
campfires	1
and	1
began	1
loading.	1
	1
"One!"	1
came	1
the	1
command.	1
	1
Number	1
one	1
jumped	1
briskly	1
aside.	1
The	1
gun	1
rang	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
deafening	1
metallic	1
roar,	1
and	1
a	1
whistling	1
grenade	1
flew	1
above	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
below	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
fell	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
a	1
little	1
smoke	1
showing	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
it	1
burst.	1
	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
sound.	1
Everyone	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
began	1
watching	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
below,	1
as	1
plainly	1
visible	1
as	1
if	1
but	1
a	1
stone's	1
throw	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
enemy	1
farther	1
off.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
sun	1
came	1
fully	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
clouds,	1
and	1
the	1
clear	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
solitary	1
shot	1
and	1
the	1
brilliance	1
of	1
the	1
bright	1
sunshine	1
merged	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
joyous	1
and	1
spirited	1
impression.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
shots	1
had	1
already	1
flown	1
across	1
the	1
bridge,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
crush.	1
Halfway	1
across	1
stood	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski,	1
who	1
had	1
alighted	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
whose	1
big	1
body	1
was	1
jammed	1
against	1
the	1
railings.	1
He	1
looked	1
back	1
laughing	1
to	1
the	1
Cossack	1
who	1
stood	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
behind	1
him	1
holding	1
two	1
horses	1
by	1
their	1
bridles.	1
Each	1
time	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski	1
tried	1
to	1
move	1
on,	1
soldiers	1
and	1
carts	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
pressed	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
railings,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
smile.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
you	1
are,	1
friend!"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack	1
to	1
a	1
convoy	1
soldier	1
with	1
a	1
wagon,	1
who	1
was	1
pressing	1
onto	1
the	1
infantrymen	1
who	1
were	1
crowded	1
together	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
wheels	1
and	1
his	1
horses.	1
"What	1
a	1
fellow!	1
You	1
can't	1
wait	1
a	1
moment!	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
general	1
wants	1
to	1
pass?"	1
	1
But	1
the	1
convoyman	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
"general"	1
and	1
shouted	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
blocking	1
his	1
way.	1
"Hi	1
there,	1
boys!	1
Keep	1
to	1
the	1
left!	1
Wait	1
a	1
bit."	1
But	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
crowded	1
together	1
shoulder	1
to	1
shoulder,	1
their	1
bayonets	1
interlocking,	1
moved	1
over	1
the	1
bridge	1
in	1
a	1
dense	1
mass.	1
Looking	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
rails	1
Prince	1
Nesvitski	1
saw	1
the	1
rapid,	1
noisy	1
little	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
Enns,	1
which	1
rippling	1
and	1
eddying	1
round	1
the	1
piles	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
chased	1
each	1
other	1
along.	1
Looking	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
he	1
saw	1
equally	1
uniform	1
living	1
waves	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
shoulder	1
straps,	1
covered	1
shakos,	1
knapsacks,	1
bayonets,	1
long	1
muskets,	1
and,	1
under	1
the	1
shakos,	1
faces	1
with	1
broad	1
cheekbones,	1
sunken	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
listless	1
tired	1
expressions,	1
and	1
feet	1
that	1
moved	1
through	1
the	1
sticky	1
mud	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Sometimes	1
through	1
the	1
monotonous	1
waves	1
of	1
men,	1
like	1
a	1
fleck	1
of	1
white	1
foam	1
on	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
Enns,	1
an	1
officer,	1
in	1
a	1
cloak	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
face	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
men,	1
squeezed	1
his	1
way	1
along;	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
chip	1
of	1
wood	1
whirling	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
an	1
hussar	1
on	1
foot,	1
an	1
orderly,	1
or	1
a	1
townsman	1
was	1
carried	1
through	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
infantry;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
log	1
floating	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
an	1
officers'	1
or	1
company's	1
baggage	1
wagon,	1
piled	1
high,	1
leather	1
covered,	1
and	1
hemmed	1
in	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
moved	1
across	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"It's	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
dam	1
had	1
burst,"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack	1
hopelessly.	1
"Are	1
there	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come?"	1
	1
"A	1
million	1
all	1
but	1
one!"	1
replied	1
a	1
waggish	1
soldier	1
in	1
a	1
torn	1
coat,	1
with	1
a	1
wink,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
followed	1
by	1
another,	1
an	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"If	1
he"	1
(he	1
meant	1
the	1
enemy)	1
"begins	1
popping	1
at	1
the	1
bridge	1
now,"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
soldier	1
dismally	1
to	1
a	1
comrade,	1
"you'll	1
forget	1
to	1
scratch	1
yourself."	1
	1
That	1
soldier	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
came	1
another	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
cart.	1
	1
"Where	1
the	1
devil	1
have	1
the	1
leg	1
bands	1
been	1
shoved	1
to?"	1
said	1
an	1
orderly,	1
running	1
behind	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
fumbling	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
also	1
passed	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
wagon.	1
Then	1
came	1
some	1
merry	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
evidently	1
been	1
drinking.	1
	1
"And	1
then,	1
old	1
fellow,	1
he	1
gives	1
him	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
with	1
the	1
butt	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
gun..."	1
a	1
soldier	1
whose	1
greatcoat	1
was	1
well	1
tucked	1
up	1
said	1
gaily,	1
with	1
a	1
wide	1
swing	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
the	1
ham	1
was	1
just	1
delicious..."	1
answered	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
laugh.	1
And	1
they,	1
too,	1
passed	1
on,	1
so	1
that	1
Nesvitski	1
did	1
not	1
learn	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
on	1
the	1
teeth,	1
or	1
what	1
the	1
ham	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
"Bah!	1
How	1
they	1
scurry.	1
He	1
just	1
sends	1
a	1
ball	1
and	1
they	1
think	1
they'll	1
all	1
be	1
killed,"	1
a	1
sergeant	1
was	1
saying	1
angrily	1
and	1
reproachfully.	1
	1
"As	1
it	1
flies	1
past	1
me,	1
Daddy,	1
the	1
ball	1
I	1
mean,"	1
said	1
a	1
young	1
soldier	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
mouth,	1
hardly	1
refraining	1
from	1
laughing,	1
"I	1
felt	1
like	1
dying	1
of	1
fright.	1
I	1
did,	1
'pon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
got	1
that	1
frightened!"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
if	1
bragging	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
frightened.	1
	1
That	1
one	1
also	1
passed.	1
Then	1
followed	1
a	1
cart	1
unlike	1
any	1
that	1
had	1
gone	1
before.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
German	1
cart	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
horses	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
German,	1
and	1
seemed	1
loaded	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
houseful	1
of	1
effects.	1
A	1
fine	1
brindled	1
cow	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
udder	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
behind.	1
A	1
woman	1
with	1
an	1
unweaned	1
baby,	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
and	1
a	1
healthy	1
German	1
girl	1
with	1
bright	1
red	1
cheeks	1
were	1
sitting	1
on	1
some	1
feather	1
beds.	1
Evidently	1
these	1
fugitives	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
pass	1
by	1
special	1
permission.	1
The	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
soldiers	1
turned	1
toward	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
vehicle	1
was	1
passing	1
at	1
foot	1
pace	1
all	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
remarks	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
ones.	1
Every	1
face	1
bore	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
smile,	1
expressing	1
unseemly	1
thoughts	1
about	1
the	1
women.	1
	1
"Just	1
see,	1
the	1
German	1
sausage	1
is	1
making	1
tracks,	1
too!"	1
	1
"Sell	1
me	1
the	1
missis,"	1
said	1
another	1
soldier,	1
addressing	1
the	1
German,	1
who,	1
angry	1
and	1
frightened,	1
strode	1
energetically	1
along	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
	1
"See	1
how	1
smart	1
she's	1
made	1
herself!	1
Oh,	1
the	1
devils!"	1
	1
"There,	1
Fedotov,	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
quartered	1
on	1
them!"	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
as	1
much	1
before	1
now,	1
mate!"	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
asked	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
was	1
eating	1
an	1
apple,	1
also	1
half	1
smiling	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
girl.	1
	1
The	1
German	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
signifying	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
"Take	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
like,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer,	1
giving	1
the	1
girl	1
an	1
apple.	1
	1
The	1
girl	1
smiled	1
and	1
took	1
it.	1
Nesvitski	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
the	1
women	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
passed.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
by,	1
the	1
same	1
stream	1
of	1
soldiers	1
followed,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
talk,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
all	1
stopped.	1
As	1
often	1
happens,	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
a	1
convoy	1
wagon	1
became	1
restive	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
stopping?	1
There's	1
no	1
proper	1
order!"	1
said	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
shoving	1
to?	1
Devil	1
take	1
you!	1
Can't	1
you	1
wait?	1
It'll	1
be	1
worse	1
if	1
he	1
fires	1
the	1
bridge.	1
See,	1
here's	1
an	1
officer	1
jammed	1
in	1
too"--	1
different	1
voices	1
were	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
crowd,	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
pressed	1
toward	1
the	1
exit	1
from	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
Looking	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Enns	1
under	1
the	1
bridge,	1
Nesvitski	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
sound	1
new	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
something	1
swiftly	1
approaching...	1
something	1
big,	1
that	1
splashed	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
"Just	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
carries	1
to!"	1
a	1
soldier	1
near	1
by	1
said	1
sternly,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
sound.	1
	1
"Encouraging	1
us	1
to	1
get	1
along	1
quicker,"	1
said	1
another	1
uneasily.	1
	1
The	1
crowd	1
moved	1
on	1
again.	1
Nesvitski	1
realized	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball.	1
	1
"Hey,	1
Cossack,	1
my	1
horse!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Now,	1
then,	1
you	1
there!	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way!	1
Make	1
way!"	1
	1
With	1
great	1
difficulty	1
he	1
managed	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
shouting	1
continually	1
he	1
moved	1
on.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
squeezed	1
themselves	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
again	1
pressed	1
on	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
jammed	1
his	1
leg,	1
and	1
those	1
nearest	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
themselves	1
pressed	1
still	1
harder	1
from	1
behind.	1
	1
"Nesvitski,	1
Nesvitski!	1
you	1
numskull!"	1
came	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
from	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Nesvitski	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
saw,	1
some	1
fifteen	1
paces	1
away	1
but	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
mass	1
of	1
moving	1
infantry,	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
red	1
and	1
shaggy,	1
with	1
his	1
cap	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
cloak	1
hanging	1
jauntily	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"Tell	1
these	1
devils,	1
these	1
fiends,	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
pass!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov	1
evidently	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
rage,	1
his	1
coal-black	1
eyes	1
with	1
their	1
bloodshot	1
whites	1
glittering	1
and	1
rolling	1
as	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
sheathed	1
saber	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
bare	1
hand	1
as	1
red	1
as	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
Vaska!"	1
joyfully	1
replied	1
Nesvitski.	1
"What's	1
up	1
with	1
you?"	1
	1
"The	1
squadwon	1
can't	1
pass,"	1
shouted	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
showing	1
his	1
white	1
teeth	1
fiercely	1
and	1
spurring	1
his	1
black	1
thoroughbred	1
Arab,	1
which	1
twitched	1
its	1
ears	1
as	1
the	1
bayonets	1
touched	1
it,	1
and	1
snorted,	1
spurting	1
white	1
foam	1
from	1
his	1
bit,	1
tramping	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
with	1
his	1
hoofs,	1
and	1
apparently	1
ready	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
the	1
railings	1
had	1
his	1
rider	1
let	1
him.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?	1
They're	1
like	1
sheep!	1
Just	1
like	1
sheep!	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
way!...	1
Let	1
us	1
pass!...	1
Stop	1
there,	1
you	1
devil	1
with	1
the	1
cart!	1
I'll	1
hack	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
saber!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
actually	1
drawing	1
his	1
saber	1
from	1
its	1
scabbard	1
and	1
flourishing	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
crowded	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
terrified	1
faces,	1
and	1
Denisov	1
joined	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"How's	1
it	1
you're	1
not	1
drunk	1
today?"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
when	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"They	1
don't	1
even	1
give	1
one	1
time	1
to	1
dwink!"	1
answered	1
Vaska	1
Denisov.	1
"They	1
keep	1
dwagging	1
the	1
wegiment	1
to	1
and	1
fwo	1
all	1
day.	1
If	1
they	1
mean	1
to	1
fight,	1
let's	1
fight.	1
But	1
the	1
devil	1
knows	1
what	1
this	1
is."	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
dandy	1
you	1
are	1
today!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski,	1
looking	1
at	1
Denisov's	1
new	1
cloak	1
and	1
saddlecloth.	1
	1
Denisov	1
smiled,	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sabretache	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
that	1
diffused	1
a	1
smell	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
Nesvitski's	1
nose.	1
	1
"Of	1
course.	1
I'm	1
going	1
into	1
action!	1
I've	1
shaved,	1
bwushed	1
my	1
teeth,	1
and	1
scented	1
myself."	1
	1
The	1
imposing	1
figure	1
of	1
Nesvitski	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
Cossack,	1
and	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
Denisov	1
who	1
flourished	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
shouted	1
frantically,	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
that	1
they	1
managed	1
to	1
squeeze	1
through	1
to	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
stopped	1
the	1
infantry.	1
Beside	1
the	1
bridge	1
Nesvitski	1
found	1
the	1
colonel	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
deliver	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
this	1
he	1
rode	1
back.	1
	1
Having	1
cleared	1
the	1
way	1
Denisov	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Carelessly	1
holding	1
in	1
his	1
stallion	1
that	1
was	1
neighing	1
and	1
pawing	1
the	1
ground,	1
eager	1
to	1
rejoin	1
its	1
fellows,	1
he	1
watched	1
his	1
squadron	1
draw	1
nearer.	1
Then	1
the	1
clang	1
of	1
hoofs,	1
as	1
of	1
several	1
horses	1
galloping,	1
resounded	1
on	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
the	1
squadron,	1
officers	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
men	1
four	1
abreast,	1
spread	1
across	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
emerge	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
infantry	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
stopped	1
crowded	1
near	1
the	1
bridge	1
in	1
the	1
trampled	1
mud	1
and	1
gazed	1
with	1
that	1
particular	1
feeling	1
of	1
ill-will,	1
estrangement,	1
and	1
ridicule	1
with	1
which	1
troops	1
of	1
different	1
arms	1
usually	1
encounter	1
one	1
another	1
at	1
the	1
clean,	1
smart	1
hussars	1
who	1
moved	1
past	1
them	1
in	1
regular	1
order.	1
	1
"Smart	1
lads!	1
Only	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
fair!"	1
said	1
one.	1
	1
"What	1
good	1
are	1
they?	1
They're	1
led	1
about	1
just	1
for	1
show!"	1
remarked	1
another.	1
	1
"Don't	1
kick	1
up	1
the	1
dust,	1
you	1
infantry!"	1
jested	1
an	1
hussar	1
whose	1
prancing	1
horse	1
had	1
splashed	1
mud	1
over	1
some	1
foot	1
soldiers.	1
	1
"I'd	1
like	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
with	1
a	1
knapsack!	1
Your	1
fine	1
cords	1
would	1
soon	1
get	1
a	1
bit	1
rubbed,"	1
said	1
an	1
infantryman,	1
wiping	1
the	1
mud	1
off	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
sleeve.	1
"Perched	1
up	1
there,	1
you're	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
than	1
a	1
man."	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Zikin,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
put	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
horse.	1
You'd	1
look	1
fine,"	1
said	1
a	1
corporal,	1
chaffing	1
a	1
thin	1
little	1
soldier	1
who	1
bent	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
knapsack.	1
	1
"Take	1
a	1
stick	1
between	1
your	1
legs,	1
that'll	1
suit	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
horse!"	1
the	1
hussar	1
shouted	1
back.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
hurriedly	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
squeezing	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
approached	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
funnel.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
had	1
all	1
crossed,	1
the	1
crush	1
was	1
less,	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
battalion	1
came	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Only	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
of	1
hussars	1
remained	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
facing	1
the	1
enemy,	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
bank	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
bridge,	1
for	1
the	1
horizon	1
as	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
valley	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
river	1
flowed	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
rising	1
ground	1
only	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
away.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
lay	1
wasteland	1
over	1
which	1
a	1
few	1
groups	1
of	1
our	1
Cossack	1
scouts	1
were	1
moving.	1
Suddenly	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
ground,	1
artillery	1
and	1
troops	1
in	1
blue	1
uniform	1
were	1
seen.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
French.	1
A	1
group	1
of	1
Cossack	1
scouts	1
retired	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
trot.	1
All	1
the	1
officers	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
Denisov's	1
squadron,	1
though	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
and	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
other	1
directions,	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
hilltop,	1
and	1
kept	1
constantly	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
patches	1
appearing	1
on	1
the	1
skyline,	1
which	1
they	1
knew	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy's	1
troops.	1
The	1
weather	1
had	1
cleared	1
again	1
since	1
noon	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
descending	1
brightly	1
upon	1
the	1
Danube	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
hills	1
around	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
calm,	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
the	1
bugle	1
calls	1
and	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
hill.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
now	1
between	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
the	1
enemy	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
scattered	1
skirmishers.	1
An	1
empty	1
space	1
of	1
some	1
seven	1
hundred	1
yards	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
separated	1
them.	1
The	1
enemy	1
ceased	1
firing,	1
and	1
that	1
stern,	1
threatening,	1
inaccessible,	1
and	1
intangible	1
line	1
which	1
separates	1
two	1
hostile	1
armies	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
clearly	1
felt.	1
	1
"One	1
step	1
beyond	1
that	1
boundary	1
line	1
which	1
resembles	1
the	1
line	1
dividing	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
lies	1
uncertainty,	1
suffering,	1
and	1
death.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
there?	1
Who	1
is	1
there?--there	1
beyond	1
that	1
field,	1
that	1
tree,	1
that	1
roof	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
sun?	1
No	1
one	1
knows,	1
but	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
know.	1
You	1
fear	1
and	1
yet	1
long	1
to	1
cross	1
that	1
line,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
crossed	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
is	1
there,	1
just	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
inevitably	1
have	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
lies	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
death.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
strong,	1
healthy,	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
excited,	1
and	1
are	1
surrounded	1
by	1
other	1
such	1
excitedly	1
animated	1
and	1
healthy	1
men."	1
So	1
thinks,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
feels,	1
anyone	1
who	1
comes	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
that	1
feeling	1
gives	1
a	1
particular	1
glamour	1
and	1
glad	1
keenness	1
of	1
impression	1
to	1
everything	1
that	1
takes	1
place	1
at	1
such	1
moments.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
high	1
ground	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
a	1
cannon	1
rose,	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
flew	1
whistling	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
squadron.	1
The	1
officers	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
together	1
rode	1
off	1
to	1
their	1
places.	1
The	1
hussars	1
began	1
carefully	1
aligning	1
their	1
horses.	1
Silence	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
squadron.	1
All	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
squadron	1
commander,	1
awaiting	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
A	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
cannon	1
ball	1
flew	1
past.	1
Evidently	1
they	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
hussars,	1
but	1
the	1
balls	1
with	1
rapid	1
rhythmic	1
whistle	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
horsemen	1
and	1
fell	1
somewhere	1
beyond	1
them.	1
The	1
hussars	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
each	1
shot,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
the	1
whole	1
squadron	1
with	1
its	1
rows	1
of	1
faces	1
so	1
alike	1
yet	1
so	1
different,	1
holding	1
its	1
breath	1
while	1
the	1
ball	1
flew	1
past,	1
rose	1
in	1
the	1
stirrups	1
and	1
sank	1
back	1
again.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
without	1
turning	1
their	1
heads	1
glanced	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
curious	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
comrades'	1
impression.	1
Every	1
face,	1
from	1
Denisov's	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
bugler,	1
showed	1
one	1
common	1
expression	1
of	1
conflict,	1
irritation,	1
and	1
excitement,	1
around	1
chin	1
and	1
mouth.	1
The	1
quartermaster	1
frowned,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
soldiers	1
as	1
if	1
threatening	1
to	1
punish	1
them.	1
Cadet	1
Mironov	1
ducked	1
every	1
time	1
a	1
ball	1
flew	1
past.	1
Rostov	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
Rook--a	1
handsome	1
horse	1
despite	1
its	1
game	1
leg--had	1
the	1
happy	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
called	1
up	1
before	1
a	1
large	1
audience	1
for	1
an	1
examination	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
feels	1
sure	1
he	1
will	1
distinguish	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
glancing	1
at	1
everyone	1
with	1
a	1
clear,	1
bright	1
expression,	1
as	1
if	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
notice	1
how	1
calmly	1
he	1
sat	1
under	1
fire.	1
But	1
despite	1
himself,	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
too	1
that	1
same	1
indication	1
of	1
something	1
new	1
and	1
stern	1
showed	1
round	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that	1
curtseying	1
there?	1
Cadet	1
Miwonov!	1
That's	1
not	1
wight!	1
Look	1
at	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Denisov	1
who,	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
still	1
on	1
one	1
spot,	1
kept	1
turning	1
his	1
horse	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
squadron.	1
	1
The	1
black,	1
hairy,	1
snub-nosed	1
face	1
of	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
short	1
sturdy	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
sinewy	1
hairy	1
hand	1
and	1
stumpy	1
fingers	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
naked	1
saber,	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
usually	1
did,	1
especially	1
toward	1
evening	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
emptied	1
his	1
second	1
bottle;	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
redder	1
than	1
usual.	1
With	1
his	1
shaggy	1
head	1
thrown	1
back	1
like	1
birds	1
when	1
they	1
drink,	1
pressing	1
his	1
spurs	1
mercilessly	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
horse,	1
Bedouin,	1
and	1
sitting	1
as	1
though	1
falling	1
backwards	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
he	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
their	1
pistols.	1
He	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Kirsten.	1
The	1
staff	1
captain	1
on	1
his	1
broad-backed,	1
steady	1
mare	1
came	1
at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
long	1
mustache	1
was	1
serious	1
as	1
always,	1
only	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
brighter	1
than	1
usual.	1
	1
"Well,	1
what	1
about	1
it?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Denisov.	1
"It	1
won't	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
fight.	1
You'll	1
see--we	1
shall	1
retire."	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
only	1
knows	1
what	1
they're	1
about!"	1
muttered	1
Denisov.	1
"Ah,	1
Wostov,"	1
he	1
cried	1
noticing	1
the	1
cadet's	1
bright	1
face,	1
"you've	1
got	1
it	1
at	1
last."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
smiled	1
approvingly,	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
cadet.	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
happy.	1
Just	1
then	1
the	1
commander	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
bridge.	1
Denisov	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!	1
Let	1
us	1
attack	1
them!	1
I'll	1
dwive	1
them	1
off."	1
	1
"Attack	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
a	1
bored	1
voice,	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
driving	1
off	1
a	1
troublesome	1
fly.	1
"And	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
stopping	1
here?	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
skirmishers	1
are	1
retreating?	1
Lead	1
the	1
squadron	1
back."	1
	1
The	1
squadron	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
drew	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
without	1
having	1
lost	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
The	1
second	1
squadron	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line	1
followed	1
them	1
across	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
Cossacks	1
quitted	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
The	1
two	1
Pavlograd	1
squadrons,	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
retired	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
Their	1
colonel,	1
Karl	1
Bogdanich	1
Schubert,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Denisov's	1
squadron	1
and	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
footpace	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Rostov,	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
him	1
although	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
meeting	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
since	1
their	1
encounter	1
concerning	1
Telyanin.	1
Rostov,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
toward	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
admitted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
blame,	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
colonel's	1
athletic	1
back,	1
his	1
nape	1
covered	1
with	1
light	1
hair,	1
and	1
his	1
red	1
neck.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
Bogdanich	1
was	1
only	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
whole	1
aim	1
now	1
was	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
cadet's	1
courage,	1
so	1
he	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
merrily;	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
Bogdanich	1
rode	1
so	1
near	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
his	1
courage.	1
Next	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
his	1
enemy	1
would	1
send	1
the	1
squadron	1
on	1
a	1
desperate	1
attack	1
just	1
to	1
punish	1
him--Rostov.	1
Then	1
he	1
imagined	1
how,	1
after	1
the	1
attack,	1
Bogdanich	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
wounded	1
and	1
would	1
magnanimously	1
extend	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
reconciliation.	1
	1
The	1
high-shouldered	1
figure	1
of	1
Zherkov,	1
familiar	1
to	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
recently	1
left	1
their	1
regiment,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel.	1
After	1
his	1
dismissal	1
from	1
headquarters	1
Zherkov	1
had	1
not	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
saying	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
slave	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
more	1
rewards	1
by	1
doing	1
nothing	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
and	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
attaching	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
orderly	1
officer	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
He	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
chief	1
with	1
an	1
order	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
rear	1
guard.	1
	1
"Colonel,"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
Rostov's	1
enemy	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
gloomy	1
gravity	1
and	1
glancing	1
round	1
at	1
his	1
comrades,	1
"there	1
is	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge."	1
	1
"An	1
order	1
to	1
who?"	1
asked	1
the	1
colonel	1
morosely.	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
myself	1
know	1
'to	1
who,'"	1
replied	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
tone,	1
"but	1
the	1
prince	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
'go	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
colonel	1
that	1
the	1
hussars	1
must	1
return	1
quickly	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge.'"	1
	1
Zherkov	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
hussars	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
order.	1
After	1
him	1
the	1
stout	1
Nesvitski	1
came	1
galloping	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
Cossack	1
horse	1
that	1
could	1
scarcely	1
carry	1
his	1
weight.	1
	1
"How's	1
this,	1
Colonel?"	1
he	1
shouted	1
as	1
he	1
approached.	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
now	1
someone	1
has	1
gone	1
and	1
blundered;	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
beside	1
themselves	1
over	1
there	1
and	1
one	1
can't	1
make	1
anything	1
out."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
deliberately	1
stopped	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"You	1
spoke	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
inflammable	1
material,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
you	1
said	1
nothing	1
about	1
firing	1
it."	1
	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
up,	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
smoothing	1
his	1
hair	1
wet	1
with	1
perspiration	1
with	1
his	1
plump	1
hand,	1
"wasn't	1
I	1
telling	1
you	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge,	1
when	1
inflammable	1
material	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
position?"	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
your	1
'dear	1
sir,'	1
Mr.	1
Staff	1
Officer,	1
and	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
to	1
burn	1
the	1
bridge!	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
service,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
habit	1
orders	1
strictly	1
to	1
obey.	1
You	1
said	1
the	1
bridge	1
would	1
be	1
burned,	1
but	1
who	1
would	1
it	1
burn,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
holy	1
spirit!"	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that's	1
always	1
the	1
way!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand.	1
"How	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
here?"	1
said	1
he,	1
turning	1
to	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
same	1
business.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
damp!	1
Let	1
me	1
wring	1
you	1
out!"	1
	1
"You	1
were	1
saying,	1
Mr.	1
Staff	1
Officer..."	1
continued	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
an	1
offended	1
tone.	1
	1
"Colonel,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
"You	1
must	1
be	1
quick	1
or	1
the	1
enemy	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
his	1
guns	1
to	1
use	1
grapeshot."	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
looked	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
at	1
the	1
stout	1
staff	1
officer,	1
and	1
at	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
he	1
frowned.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
the	1
bridge	1
fire,"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
announce	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unpleasantness	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
endure	1
he	1
would	1
still	1
do	1
the	1
right	1
thing.	1
	1
Striking	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
muscular	1
legs	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
everything,	1
the	1
colonel	1
moved	1
forward	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
second	1
squadron,	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving	1
under	1
Denisov,	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
	1
"There,	1
it's	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
himself.	1
"He	1
wishes	1
to	1
test	1
me!"	1
His	1
heart	1
contracted	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
rushed	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
"Let	1
him	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
	1
Again	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
bright	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
the	1
serious	1
expression	1
appeared	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
worn	1
when	1
under	1
fire.	1
Rostov	1
watched	1
his	1
enemy,	1
the	1
colonel,	1
closely--to	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
confirmation	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
conjecture,	1
but	1
the	1
colonel	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
glance	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
did	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
solemn	1
and	1
stern.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command.	1
	1
"Look	1
sharp!	1
Look	1
sharp!"	1
several	1
voices	1
repeated	1
around	1
him.	1
	1
Their	1
sabers	1
catching	1
in	1
the	1
bridles	1
and	1
their	1
spurs	1
jingling,	1
the	1
hussars	1
hastily	1
dismounted,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
crossing	1
themselves.	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
colonel,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
falling	1
behind	1
the	1
hussars,	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
that	1
his	1
heart	1
stood	1
still.	1
His	1
hand	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
horse	1
into	1
an	1
orderly's	1
charge,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
a	1
thud.	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
past	1
him,	1
leaning	1
back	1
and	1
shouting	1
something.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
hussars	1
running	1
all	1
around	1
him,	1
their	1
spurs	1
catching	1
and	1
their	1
sabers	1
clattering.	1
	1
"Stretchers!"	1
shouted	1
someone	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
what	1
this	1
call	1
for	1
stretchers	1
meant;	1
he	1
ran	1
on,	1
trying	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
but	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
bridge,	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
some	1
sticky,	1
trodden	1
mud,	1
stumbled,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
hands.	1
The	1
others	1
outstripped	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
boss	1
zides,	1
Captain,"	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
colonel,	1
who,	1
having	1
ridden	1
ahead,	1
had	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
near	1
the	1
bridge,	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant,	1
cheerful	1
face.	1
	1
Rostov	1
wiping	1
his	1
muddy	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breeches	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
enemy	1
and	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
run	1
on,	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
farther	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
the	1
better.	1
But	1
Bogdanich,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
or	1
recognizing	1
Rostov,	1
shouted	1
to	1
him:	1
	1
"Who's	1
that	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
bridge?	1
To	1
the	1
right!	1
Come	1
back,	1
Cadet!"	1
he	1
cried	1
angrily;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Denisov,	1
who,	1
showing	1
off	1
his	1
courage,	1
had	1
ridden	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
planks	1
of	1
the	1
bridge:	1
	1
"Why	1
run	1
risks,	1
Captain?	1
You	1
should	1
dismount,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
every	1
bullet	1
has	1
its	1
billet,"	1
answered	1
Vaska	1
Denisov,	1
turning	1
in	1
his	1
saddle.	1
	1
Meanwhile	1
Nesvitski,	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
were	1
standing	1
together	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
the	1
shots,	1
watching,	1
now	1
the	1
small	1
group	1
of	1
men	1
with	1
yellow	1
shakos,	1
dark-green	1
jackets	1
braided	1
with	1
cord,	1
and	1
blue	1
riding	1
breeches,	1
who	1
were	1
swarming	1
near	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
approaching	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
opposite	1
side--the	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
and	1
groups	1
with	1
horses,	1
easily	1
recognizable	1
as	1
artillery.	1
	1
"Will	1
they	1
burn	1
the	1
bridge	1
or	1
not?	1
Who'll	1
get	1
there	1
first?	1
Will	1
they	1
get	1
there	1
and	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
or	1
will	1
the	1
French	1
get	1
within	1
grapeshot	1
range	1
and	1
wipe	1
them	1
out?"	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
questions	1
each	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
ground	1
above	1
the	1
bridge	1
involuntarily	1
asked	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
sinking	1
heart--watching	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
hussars	1
in	1
the	1
bright	1
evening	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
tunics	1
advancing	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
with	1
their	1
bayonets	1
and	1
guns.	1
	1
"Ugh.	1
The	1
hussars	1
will	1
get	1
it	1
hot!"	1
said	1
Nesvitski;	1
"they	1
are	1
within	1
grapeshot	1
range	1
now."	1
	1
"He	1
shouldn't	1
have	1
taken	1
so	1
many	1
men,"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite.	1
	1
"True	1
enough,"	1
answered	1
Nesvitski;	1
"two	1
smart	1
fellows	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
job	1
just	1
as	1
well."	1
	1
"Ah,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
put	1
in	1
Zherkov,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
hussars,	1
but	1
still	1
with	1
that	1
naive	1
air	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
jest	1
or	1
in	1
earnest.	1
"Ah,	1
your	1
excellency!	1
How	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
things!	1
Send	1
two	1
men?	1
And	1
who	1
then	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
Vladimir	1
medal	1
and	1
ribbon?	1
But	1
now,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
get	1
peppered,	1
the	1
squadron	1
may	1
be	1
recommended	1
for	1
honors	1
and	1
he	1
may	1
get	1
a	1
ribbon.	1
Our	1
Bogdanich	1
knows	1
how	1
things	1
are	1
done."	1
	1
"There	1
now!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
"that's	1
grapeshot."	1
	1
He	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
guns,	1
the	1
limbers	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
detached	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
removed.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
French	1
side,	1
amid	1
the	1
groups	1
with	1
cannon,	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
appeared,	1
then	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
almost	1
simultaneously,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
report	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
fourth	1
was	1
seen.	1
Then	1
two	1
reports	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
and	1
a	1
third.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
groaned	1
Nesvitski	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
fierce	1
pain,	1
seizing	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
by	1
the	1
arm.	1
"Look!	1
A	1
man	1
has	1
fallen!	1
Fallen,	1
fallen!"	1
	1
"Two,	1
I	1
think."	1
	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
Tsar	1
I	1
would	1
never	1
go	1
to	1
war,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski,	1
turning	1
away.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
guns	1
were	1
hastily	1
reloaded.	1
The	1
infantry	1
in	1
their	1
blue	1
uniforms	1
advanced	1
toward	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
a	1
run.	1
Smoke	1
appeared	1
again	1
but	1
at	1
irregular	1
intervals,	1
and	1
grapeshot	1
cracked	1
and	1
rattled	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge.	1
But	1
this	1
time	1
Nesvitski	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
there,	1
as	1
a	1
dense	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
arose	1
from	1
it.	1
The	1
hussars	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
it	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
batteries	1
were	1
now	1
firing	1
at	1
them,	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
hinder	1
them	1
but	1
because	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
trained	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
to	1
fire	1
at.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
fire	1
three	1
rounds	1
of	1
grapeshot	1
before	1
the	1
hussars	1
got	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
horses.	1
Two	1
were	1
misdirected	1
and	1
the	1
shot	1
went	1
too	1
high,	1
but	1
the	1
last	1
round	1
fell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
hussars	1
and	1
knocked	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
over.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
absorbed	1
by	1
his	1
relations	1
with	1
Bogdanich,	1
had	1
paused	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
hew	1
down	1
(as	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
imagined	1
battles	1
to	1
himself),	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
help	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
bridge	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
any	1
burning	1
straw	1
with	1
him	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
soldiers.	1
He	1
stood	1
looking	1
about	1
him,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
rattle	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
as	1
if	1
nuts	1
were	1
being	1
spilt,	1
and	1
the	1
hussar	1
nearest	1
to	1
him	1
fell	1
against	1
the	1
rails	1
with	1
a	1
groan.	1
Rostov	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
others.	1
Again	1
someone	1
shouted,	1
"Stretchers!"	1
Four	1
men	1
seized	1
the	1
hussar	1
and	1
began	1
lifting	1
him.	1
	1
"Oooh!	1
For	1
Christ's	1
sake	1
let	1
me	1
alone!"	1
cried	1
the	1
wounded	1
man,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
lifted	1
and	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
stretcher.	1
	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
turned	1
away	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
searching	1
for	1
something,	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
distance,	1
at	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
at	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sun.	1
How	1
beautiful	1
the	1
sky	1
looked;	1
how	1
blue,	1
how	1
calm,	1
and	1
how	1
deep!	1
How	1
bright	1
and	1
glorious	1
was	1
the	1
setting	1
sun!	1
With	1
what	1
soft	1
glitter	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
Danube	1
shone.	1
And	1
fairer	1
still	1
were	1
the	1
faraway	1
blue	1
mountains	1
beyond	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
nunnery,	1
the	1
mysterious	1
gorges,	1
and	1
the	1
pine	1
forests	1
veiled	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
their	1
summits...	1
There	1
was	1
peace	1
and	1
happiness...	1
"I	1
should	1
wish	1
for	1
nothing	1
else,	1
nothing,	1
if	1
only	1
I	1
were	1
there,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"In	1
myself	1
alone	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
sunshine	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
happiness;	1
but	1
here...	1
groans,	1
suffering,	1
fear,	1
and	1
this	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
hurry...	1
There--they	1
are	1
shouting	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
are	1
all	1
running	1
back	1
somewhere,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
run	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
it,	1
death,	1
is	1
here	1
above	1
me	1
and	1
around...	1
Another	1
instant	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
again	1
see	1
the	1
sun,	1
this	1
water,	1
that	1
gorge!..."	1
	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
sun	1
began	1
to	1
hide	1
behind	1
the	1
clouds,	1
and	1
other	1
stretchers	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
before	1
Rostov.	1
And	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
death	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stretchers,	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
of	1
life,	1
all	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
feeling	1
of	1
sickening	1
agitation.	1
	1
"O	1
Lord	1
God!	1
Thou	1
who	1
art	1
in	1
that	1
heaven,	1
save,	1
forgive,	1
and	1
protect	1
me!"	1
Rostov	1
whispered.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
ran	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
held	1
their	1
horses;	1
their	1
voices	1
sounded	1
louder	1
and	1
calmer,	1
the	1
stretchers	1
disappeared	1
from	1
sight.	1
	1
"Well,	1
fwiend?	1
So	1
you've	1
smelt	1
powdah!"	1
shouted	1
Vaska	1
Denisov	1
just	1
above	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
over;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
coward--yes,	1
a	1
coward!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
and	1
sighing	1
deeply	1
he	1
took	1
Rook,	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
stood	1
resting	1
one	1
foot,	1
from	1
the	1
orderly	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
mount.	1
	1
"Was	1
that	1
grapeshot?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Denisov.	1
	1
"Yes	1
and	1
no	1
mistake!"	1
cried	1
Denisov.	1
"You	1
worked	1
like	1
wegular	1
bwicks	1
and	1
it's	1
nasty	1
work!	1
An	1
attack's	1
pleasant	1
work!	1
Hacking	1
away	1
at	1
the	1
dogs!	1
But	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
devil,	1
with	1
them	1
shooting	1
at	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
target."	1
	1
And	1
Denisov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
group	1
that	1
had	1
stopped	1
near	1
Rostov,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
colonel,	1
Nesvitski,	1
Zherkov,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
from	1
the	1
suite.	1
	1
"Well,	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
noticed,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
true.	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
taken	1
any	1
notice,	1
for	1
everyone	1
knew	1
the	1
sensation	1
which	1
the	1
cadet	1
under	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
had	1
experienced.	1
	1
"Here's	1
something	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
report,"	1
said	1
Zherkov.	1
"See	1
if	1
I	1
don't	1
get	1
promoted	1
to	1
a	1
sublieutenancy."	1
	1
"Inform	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
bridge	1
fired!"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
triumphantly	1
and	1
gaily.	1
	1
"And	1
if	1
he	1
asks	1
about	1
the	1
losses?"	1
	1
"A	1
trifle,"	1
said	1
the	1
colonel	1
in	1
his	1
bass	1
voice:	1
"two	1
hussars	1
wounded,	1
and	1
one	1
knocked	1
out,"	1
he	1
added,	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
a	1
happy	1
smile,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
the	1
phrase	1
"knocked	1
out"	1
with	1
ringing	1
distinctness.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
Pursued	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Bonaparte,	1
encountering	1
a	1
population	1
that	1
was	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
it,	1
losing	1
confidence	1
in	1
its	1
allies,	1
suffering	1
from	1
shortness	1
of	1
supplies,	1
and	1
compelled	1
to	1
act	1
under	1
conditions	1
of	1
war	1
unlike	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
foreseen,	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
of	1
thirty-five	1
thousand	1
men	1
commanded	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
hurriedly	1
retreating	1
along	1
the	1
Danube,	1
stopping	1
where	1
overtaken	1
by	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fighting	1
rearguard	1
actions	1
only	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
necessary	1
to	1
enable	1
it	1
to	1
retreat	1
without	1
losing	1
its	1
heavy	1
equipment.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
actions	1
at	1
Lambach,	1
Amstetten,	1
and	1
Melk;	1
but	1
despite	1
the	1
courage	1
and	1
endurance--acknowledged	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
enemy--with	1
which	1
the	1
Russians	1
fought,	1
the	1
only	1
consequence	1
of	1
these	1
actions	1
was	1
a	1
yet	1
more	1
rapid	1
retreat.	1
Austrian	1
troops	1
that	1
had	1
escaped	1
capture	1
at	1
Ulm	1
and	1
had	1
joined	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
Braunau	1
now	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
only	1
his	1
own	1
weak	1
and	1
exhausted	1
forces.	1
The	1
defense	1
of	1
Vienna	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of.	1
Instead	1
of	1
an	1
offensive,	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
which,	1
carefully	1
prepared	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
modern	1
science	1
of	1
strategics,	1
had	1
been	1
handed	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Vienna	1
by	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Hofkriegsrath,	1
the	1
sole	1
and	1
almost	1
unattainable	1
aim	1
remaining	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
the	1
forces	1
that	1
were	1
advancing	1
from	1
Russia,	1
without	1
losing	1
his	1
army	1
as	1
Mack	1
had	1
done	1
at	1
Ulm.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twenty-eighth	1
of	1
October	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
army	1
crossed	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
river	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
main	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
French.	1
On	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
he	1
attacked	1
Mortier's	1
division,	1
which	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
bank,	1
and	1
broke	1
it	1
up.	1
In	1
this	1
action	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
trophies	1
were	1
taken:	1
banners,	1
cannon,	1
and	1
two	1
enemy	1
generals.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
after	1
a	1
fortnight's	1
retreat,	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
had	1
halted	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
fight	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
held	1
the	1
field	1
but	1
had	1
repulsed	1
the	1
French.	1
Though	1
the	1
troops	1
were	1
ill-clad,	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
had	1
lost	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
their	1
number	1
in	1
killed,	1
wounded,	1
sick,	1
and	1
stragglers;	1
though	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Danube	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
entrusted	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
humanity	1
of	1
the	1
enemy;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
big	1
hospitals	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
in	1
Krems	1
converted	1
into	1
military	1
hospitals	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
accommodate	1
all	1
the	1
sick	1
and	1
wounded,	1
yet	1
the	1
stand	1
made	1
at	1
Krems	1
and	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
Mortier	1
raised	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
considerably.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
and	1
at	1
headquarters	1
most	1
joyful	1
though	1
erroneous	1
rumors	1
were	1
rife	1
of	1
the	1
imaginary	1
approach	1
of	1
columns	1
from	1
Russia,	1
of	1
some	1
victory	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
the	1
frightened	1
Bonaparte.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
Austrian	1
General	1
Schmidt,	1
who	1
was	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
action.	1
His	1
horse	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
under	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
arm	1
slightly	1
grazed	1
by	1
a	1
bullet.	1
As	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
special	1
favor	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
this	1
victory	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
court,	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
Vienna	1
(which	1
was	1
threatened	1
by	1
the	1
French)	1
but	1
at	1
Brunn.	1
Despite	1
his	1
apparently	1
delicate	1
build	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
endure	1
physical	1
fatigue	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
many	1
very	1
muscular	1
men,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
having	1
arrived	1
at	1
Krems	1
excited	1
but	1
not	1
weary,	1
with	1
dispatches	1
from	1
Dokhturov	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
dispatch	1
to	1
Brunn.	1
To	1
be	1
so	1
sent	1
meant	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
reward	1
but	1
an	1
important	1
step	1
toward	1
promotion.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
dark	1
but	1
starry,	1
the	1
road	1
showed	1
black	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
that	1
had	1
fallen	1
the	1
previous	1
day--the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
battle.	1
Reviewing	1
his	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
recent	1
battle,	1
picturing	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
impression	1
his	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
would	1
create,	1
or	1
recalling	1
the	1
send-off	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
his	1
fellow	1
officers,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
galloping	1
along	1
in	1
a	1
post	1
chaise	1
enjoying	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
at	1
length	1
begun	1
to	1
attain	1
a	1
long-desired	1
happiness.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
his	1
ears	1
seemed	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
the	1
sensation	1
of	1
victory.	1
Then	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
running	1
away	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
killed,	1
but	1
he	1
quickly	1
roused	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy,	1
as	1
if	1
learning	1
afresh	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
but	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
run	1
away.	1
He	1
again	1
recalled	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
calm	1
courage	1
during	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
feeling	1
reassured	1
he	1
dozed	1
off....	1
The	1
dark	1
starry	1
night	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
morning.	1
The	1
snow	1
was	1
thawing	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
the	1
horses	1
galloped	1
quickly,	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
were	1
forests	1
of	1
different	1
kinds,	1
fields,	1
and	1
villages.	1
	1
At	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
stations	1
he	1
overtook	1
a	1
convoy	1
of	1
Russian	1
wounded.	1
The	1
Russian	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
lolled	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
cart,	1
shouting	1
and	1
scolding	1
a	1
soldier	1
with	1
coarse	1
abuse.	1
In	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
German	1
carts	1
six	1
or	1
more	1
pale,	1
dirty,	1
bandaged	1
men	1
were	1
being	1
jolted	1
over	1
the	1
stony	1
road.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
talking	1
(he	1
heard	1
Russian	1
words),	1
others	1
were	1
eating	1
bread;	1
the	1
more	1
severely	1
wounded	1
looked	1
silently,	1
with	1
the	1
languid	1
interest	1
of	1
sick	1
children,	1
at	1
the	1
envoy	1
hurrying	1
past	1
them.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
his	1
driver	1
to	1
stop,	1
and	1
asked	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
what	1
action	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
wounded.	1
"Day	1
before	1
yesterday,	1
on	1
the	1
Danube,"	1
answered	1
the	1
soldier.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
purse	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
soldier	1
three	1
gold	1
pieces.	1
	1
"That's	1
for	1
them	1
all,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
who	1
came	1
up.	1
	1
"Get	1
well	1
soon,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
continued,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"There's	1
plenty	1
to	1
do	1
still."	1
	1
"What	1
news,	1
sir?"	1
asked	1
the	1
officer,	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
conversation.	1
	1
"Good	1
news!...	1
Go	1
on!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver,	1
and	1
they	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
quite	1
dark	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rattled	1
over	1
the	1
paved	1
streets	1
of	1
Brunn	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
surrounded	1
by	1
high	1
buildings,	1
the	1
lights	1
of	1
shops,	1
houses,	1
and	1
street	1
lamps,	1
fine	1
carriages,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
active	1
town	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
so	1
attractive	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
after	1
camp	1
life.	1
Despite	1
his	1
rapid	1
journey	1
and	1
sleepless	1
night,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
when	1
he	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
felt	1
even	1
more	1
vigorous	1
and	1
alert	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
Only	1
his	1
eyes	1
gleamed	1
feverishly	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
followed	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
clearness	1
and	1
rapidity.	1
He	1
again	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
no	1
longer	1
dim,	1
but	1
definite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
concise	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
stating	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis.	1
He	1
vividly	1
imagined	1
the	1
casual	1
questions	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
answers	1
he	1
would	1
give.	1
He	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
At	1
the	1
chief	1
entrance	1
to	1
the	1
palace,	1
however,	1
an	1
official	1
came	1
running	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
learning	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
special	1
messenger	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
another	1
entrance.	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
right	1
from	1
the	1
corridor,	1
Euer	1
Hochgeboren!	1
There	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty,"	1
said	1
the	1
official.	1
"He	1
will	1
conduct	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War."	1
	1
The	1
adjutant	1
on	1
duty,	1
meeting	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
wait,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
bowing	1
with	1
particular	1
courtesy	1
ushered	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
before	1
him	1
along	1
a	1
corridor	1
to	1
the	1
cabinet	1
where	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
was	1
at	1
work.	1
The	1
adjutant	1
by	1
his	1
elaborate	1
courtesy	1
appeared	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
any	1
attempt	1
at	1
familiarity	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
messenger.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
joyous	1
feeling	1
was	1
considerably	1
weakened	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
minister's	1
room.	1
He	1
felt	1
offended,	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
noticing	1
it	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
offense	1
immediately	1
turned	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
disdain	1
which	1
was	1
quite	1
uncalled	1
for.	1
His	1
fertile	1
mind	1
instantly	1
suggested	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
despise	1
the	1
adjutant	1
and	1
the	1
minister.	1
"Away	1
from	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
powder,	1
they	1
probably	1
think	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
gain	1
victories!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
His	1
eyes	1
narrowed	1
disdainfully,	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
with	1
peculiarly	1
deliberate	1
steps.	1
This	1
feeling	1
of	1
disdain	1
was	1
heightened	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
minister	1
seated	1
at	1
a	1
large	1
table	1
reading	1
some	1
papers	1
and	1
making	1
pencil	1
notes	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
minutes	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
arrival.	1
A	1
wax	1
candle	1
stood	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
minister's	1
bent	1
bald	1
head	1
with	1
its	1
gray	1
temples.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
reading	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps.	1
	1
"Take	1
this	1
and	1
deliver	1
it,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant,	1
handing	1
him	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
still	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
special	1
messenger.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
actions	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
army	1
interested	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
less	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
matters	1
he	1
was	1
concerned	1
with,	1
or	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Russian	1
special	1
messenger	1
that	1
impression.	1
"But	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
to	1
me,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
The	1
minister	1
drew	1
the	1
remaining	1
papers	1
together,	1
arranged	1
them	1
evenly,	1
and	1
then	1
raised	1
his	1
head.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
intellectual	1
and	1
distinctive	1
head,	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
the	1
firm,	1
intelligent	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
evidently	1
deliberate	1
and	1
habitual	1
to	1
him.	1
His	1
face	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
stupid	1
artificial	1
smile	1
(which	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
attempt	1
to	1
hide	1
its	1
artificiality)	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
continually	1
receiving	1
many	1
petitioners	1
one	1
after	1
another.	1
	1
"From	1
General	1
Field	1
Marshal	1
Kutuzov?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"I	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
news?	1
There	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
encounter	1
with	1
Mortier?	1
A	1
victory?	1
It	1
was	1
high	1
time!"	1
	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
dispatch	1
which	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
mournful	1
expression.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
God!	1
My	1
God!	1
Schmidt!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
German.	1
"What	1
a	1
calamity!	1
What	1
a	1
calamity!"	1
	1
Having	1
glanced	1
through	1
the	1
dispatch	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
evidently	1
considering	1
something.	1
	1
"Ah	1
what	1
a	1
calamity!	1
You	1
say	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
decisive?	1
But	1
Mortier	1
is	1
not	1
captured."	1
Again	1
he	1
pondered.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
good	1
news,	1
though	1
Schmidt's	1
death	1
is	1
a	1
heavy	1
price	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
victory.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
will	1
no	1
doubt	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
but	1
not	1
today.	1
I	1
thank	1
you!	1
You	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
rest.	1
Be	1
at	1
the	1
levee	1
tomorrow	1
after	1
the	1
parade.	1
However,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
you	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
stupid	1
smile,	1
which	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
face	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking,	1
reappeared.	1
	1
"Au	1
revoir!	1
Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much.	1
His	1
Majesty	1
will	1
probably	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
you,"	1
he	1
added,	1
bowing	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
left	1
the	1
palace	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
happiness	1
the	1
victory	1
had	1
afforded	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
indifferent	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
and	1
the	1
polite	1
adjutant.	1
The	1
whole	1
tenor	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
instantaneously	1
changed;	1
the	1
battle	1
seemed	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
a	1
remote	1
event	1
long	1
past.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stayed	1
at	1
Brunn	1
with	1
Bilibin,	1
a	1
Russian	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
his	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
service.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
prince!	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
welcome	1
visitor,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Franz,	1
put	1
the	1
prince's	1
things	1
in	1
my	1
bedroom,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
was	1
ushering	1
Bolkonski	1
in.	1
"So	1
you're	1
a	1
messenger	1
of	1
victory,	1
eh?	1
Splendid!	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sitting	1
here	1
ill,	1
as	1
you	1
see."	1
	1
After	1
washing	1
and	1
dressing,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
diplomat's	1
luxurious	1
study	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
dinner	1
prepared	1
for	1
him.	1
Bilibin	1
settled	1
down	1
comfortably	1
beside	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
After	1
his	1
journey	1
and	1
the	1
campaign	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
deprived	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
refinements	1
of	1
life,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
a	1
pleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
repose	1
among	1
luxurious	1
surroundings	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
from	1
childhood.	1
Besides	1
it	1
was	1
pleasant,	1
after	1
his	1
reception	1
by	1
the	1
Austrians,	1
to	1
speak	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
Russian	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
French)	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
a	1
Russian	1
who	1
would,	1
he	1
supposed,	1
share	1
the	1
general	1
Russian	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
Austrians	1
which	1
was	1
then	1
particularly	1
strong.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
thirty-five,	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
circle	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
They	1
had	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
previously	1
in	1
Petersburg,	1
but	1
had	1
become	1
more	1
intimate	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
Vienna	1
with	1
Kutuzov.	1
Just	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
high	1
in	1
the	1
military	1
profession,	1
so	1
to	1
an	1
even	1
greater	1
extent	1
Bilibin	1
gave	1
promise	1
of	1
rising	1
in	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career.	1
He	1
still	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
but	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
young	1
diplomat,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
service	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
sixteen,	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
Paris	1
and	1
Copenhagen,	1
and	1
now	1
held	1
a	1
rather	1
important	1
post	1
in	1
Vienna.	1
Both	1
the	1
foreign	1
minister	1
and	1
our	1
ambassador	1
in	1
Vienna	1
knew	1
him	1
and	1
valued	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
many	1
diplomats	1
who	1
are	1
esteemed	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
certain	1
negative	1
qualities,	1
avoid	1
doing	1
certain	1
things,	1
and	1
speak	1
French.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those,	1
who,	1
liking	1
work,	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
indolence	1
would	1
sometimes	1
spend	1
a	1
whole	1
night	1
at	1
his	1
writing	1
table.	1
He	1
worked	1
well	1
whatever	1
the	1
import	1
of	1
his	1
work.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
question	1
"What	1
for?"	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
"How?"	1
that	1
interested	1
him.	1
What	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
matter	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care,	1
but	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
circular,	1
memorandum,	1
or	1
report,	1
skillfully,	1
pointedly,	1
and	1
elegantly.	1
Bilibin's	1
services	1
were	1
valued	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
wrote,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
his	1
skill	1
in	1
dealing	1
and	1
conversing	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spheres.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
liked	1
conversation	1
as	1
he	1
liked	1
work,	1
only	1
when	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
elegantly	1
witty.	1
In	1
society	1
he	1
always	1
awaited	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
striking	1
and	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
conversation	1
only	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
possible.	1
His	1
conversation	1
was	1
always	1
sprinkled	1
with	1
wittily	1
original,	1
finished	1
phrases	1
of	1
general	1
interest.	1
These	1
sayings	1
were	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
inner	1
laboratory	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
portable	1
form	1
as	1
if	1
intentionally,	1
so	1
that	1
insignificant	1
society	1
people	1
might	1
carry	1
them	1
from	1
drawing	1
room	1
to	1
drawing	1
room.	1
And,	1
in	1
fact,	1
Bilibin's	1
witticisms	1
were	1
hawked	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
Viennese	1
drawing	1
rooms	1
and	1
often	1
had	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
matters	1
considered	1
important.	1
	1
His	1
thin,	1
worn,	1
sallow	1
face	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
deep	1
wrinkles,	1
which	1
always	1
looked	1
as	1
clean	1
and	1
well	1
washed	1
as	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
one's	1
fingers	1
after	1
a	1
Russian	1
bath.	1
The	1
movement	1
of	1
these	1
wrinkles	1
formed	1
the	1
principal	1
play	1
of	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
Now	1
his	1
forehead	1
would	1
pucker	1
into	1
deep	1
folds	1
and	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
were	1
lifted,	1
then	1
his	1
eyebrows	1
would	1
descend	1
and	1
deep	1
wrinkles	1
would	1
crease	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
His	1
small,	1
deep-set	1
eyes	1
always	1
twinkled	1
and	1
looked	1
out	1
straight.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
exploits,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Bolkonski,	1
very	1
modestly	1
without	1
once	1
mentioning	1
himself,	1
described	1
the	1
engagement	1
and	1
his	1
reception	1
by	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War.	1
	1
"They	1
received	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
news	1
as	1
one	1
receives	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
skittles,"	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
conclusion.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
smiled	1
and	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
disappeared.	1
	1
"Cependant,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
he	1
remarked,	1
examining	1
his	1
nails	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
puckering	1
the	1
skin	1
above	1
his	1
left	1
eye,	1
"malgre	1
la	1
haute	1
estime	1
que	1
je	1
professe	1
pour	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,	1
j'avoue	1
que	1
votre	1
victoire	1
n'est	1
pas	1
des	1
plus	1
victorieuses."	1
*	1
	1
	1
*	1
"But	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
was	1
not	1
particularly	1
victorious."	1
	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
French,	1
uttering	1
only	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
Russian	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
emphasis.	1
	1
"Come	1
now!	1
You	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
forces	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Mortier	1
and	1
his	1
one	1
division,	1
and	1
even	1
then	1
Mortier	1
slips	1
through	1
your	1
fingers!	1
Where's	1
the	1
victory?"	1
	1
"But	1
seriously,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"we	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
say	1
without	1
boasting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
better	1
than	1
at	1
Ulm..."	1
	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
capture	1
one,	1
just	1
one,	1
marshal	1
for	1
us?"	1
	1
"Because	1
not	1
everything	1
happens	1
as	1
one	1
expects	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
smoothness	1
of	1
a	1
parade.	1
We	1
had	1
expected,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
their	1
rear	1
by	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
reached	1
it	1
by	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon."	1
	1
"And	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning?	1
You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning,"	1
returned	1
Bilibin	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"You	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
at	1
seven	1
in	1
the	1
morning."	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
impressing	1
on	1
Bonaparte	1
by	1
diplomatic	1
methods	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
leave	1
Genoa	1
alone?"	1
retorted	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone.	1
	1
"I	1
know,"	1
interrupted	1
Bilibin,	1
"you're	1
thinking	1
it's	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
take	1
marshals,	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
by	1
the	1
fire!	1
That	1
is	1
true,	1
but	1
still	1
why	1
didn't	1
you	1
capture	1
him?	1
So	1
don't	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
but	1
also	1
his	1
Most	1
August	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
King	1
Francis	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
delighted	1
by	1
your	1
victory.	1
Even	1
I,	1
a	1
poor	1
secretary	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
Embassy,	1
do	1
not	1
feel	1
any	1
need	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
my	1
joy	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
Franz	1
a	1
thaler,	1
or	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
with	1
his	1
Liebchen	1
to	1
the	1
Prater...	1
True,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
Prater	1
here..."	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
suddenly	1
unwrinkled	1
his	1
forehead.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
now	1
my	1
turn	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
'why?'	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
"I	1
confess	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand:	1
perhaps	1
there	1
are	1
diplomatic	1
subtleties	1
here	1
beyond	1
my	1
feeble	1
intelligence,	1
but	1
I	1
can't	1
make	1
it	1
out.	1
Mack	1
loses	1
a	1
whole	1
army,	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
give	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
make	1
blunder	1
after	1
blunder.	1
Kutuzov	1
alone	1
at	1
last	1
gains	1
a	1
real	1
victory,	1
destroying	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
invincibility	1
of	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
care	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
details."	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow.	1
You	1
see	1
it's	1
hurrah	1
for	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
for	1
Russia,	1
for	1
the	1
Orthodox	1
Greek	1
faith!	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
but	1
what	1
do	1
we,	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
Austrian	1
court,	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
victories?	1
Bring	1
us	1
nice	1
news	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
by	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
or	1
Ferdinand	1
(one	1
archduke's	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
another,	1
as	1
you	1
know)	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
over	1
a	1
fire	1
brigade	1
of	1
Bonaparte's,	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
another	1
story	1
and	1
we'll	1
fire	1
off	1
some	1
cannon!	1
But	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
seems	1
done	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
vex	1
us.	1
The	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
does	1
nothing,	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Ferdinand	1
disgraces	1
himself.	1
You	1
abandon	1
Vienna,	1
give	1
up	1
its	1
defense--as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say:	1
'Heaven	1
is	1
with	1
us,	1
but	1
heaven	1
help	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
capital!'	1
The	1
one	1
general	1
whom	1
we	1
all	1
loved,	1
Schmidt,	1
you	1
expose	1
to	1
a	1
bullet,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
congratulate	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
victory!	1
Admit	1
that	1
more	1
irritating	1
news	1
than	1
yours	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
conceived.	1
It's	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
on	1
purpose,	1
on	1
purpose.	1
Besides,	1
suppose	1
you	1
did	1
gain	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory,	1
if	1
even	1
the	1
Archduke	1
Karl	1
gained	1
a	1
victory,	1
what	1
effect	1
would	1
that	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
events?	1
It's	1
too	1
late	1
now	1
when	1
Vienna	1
is	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
army!"	1
	1
"What?	1
Occupied?	1
Vienna	1
occupied?"	1
	1
"Not	1
only	1
occupied,	1
but	1
Bonaparte	1
is	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
and	1
the	1
count,	1
our	1
dear	1
Count	1
Vrbna,	1
goes	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
orders."	1
	1
After	1
the	1
fatigues	1
and	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
journey,	1
his	1
reception,	1
and	1
especially	1
after	1
having	1
dined,	1
Bolkonski	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
heard.	1
	1
"Count	1
Lichtenfels	1
was	1
here	1
this	1
morning,"	1
Bilibin	1
continued,	1
"and	1
showed	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
parade	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
in	1
Vienna	1
was	1
fully	1
described:	1
Prince	1
Murat	1
et	1
tout	1
le	1
tremblement...	1
You	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
victory	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
for	1
great	1
rejoicing	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
can't	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
a	1
savior."	1
	1
"Really	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
about	1
that,	1
I	1
don't	1
care	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
beginning	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
his	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
before	1
Krems	1
was	1
really	1
of	1
small	1
importance	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
such	1
events	1
as	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
Austria's	1
capital.	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
Vienna	1
was	1
taken?	1
What	1
of	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
its	1
celebrated	1
bridgehead	1
and	1
Prince	1
Auersperg?	1
We	1
heard	1
reports	1
that	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
was	1
defending	1
Vienna?"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Prince	1
Auersperg	1
is	1
on	1
this,	1
on	1
our	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
is	1
defending	1
us--doing	1
it	1
very	1
badly,	1
I	1
think,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
is	1
defending	1
us.	1
But	1
Vienna	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
No,	1
the	1
bridge	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
taken	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
orders	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
blow	1
it	1
up.	1
Otherwise	1
we	1
should	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Bohemia,	1
and	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
army	1
would	1
have	1
spent	1
a	1
bad	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
between	1
two	1
fires."	1
	1
"But	1
still	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
over,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is.	1
The	1
bigwigs	1
here	1
think	1
so	1
too,	1
but	1
they	1
daren't	1
say	1
so.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
it	1
won't	1
be	1
your	1
skirmishing	1
at	1
Durrenstein,	1
or	1
gunpowder	1
at	1
all,	1
that	1
will	1
decide	1
the	1
matter,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
devised	1
it,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
quoting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mots,	1
releasing	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
on	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
pausing.	1
"The	1
only	1
question	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
meeting	1
between	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Prussia	1
in	1
Berlin?	1
If	1
Prussia	1
joins	1
the	1
Allies,	1
Austria's	1
hand	1
will	1
be	1
forced	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
war.	1
If	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
settling	1
where	1
the	1
preliminaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Campo	1
Formio	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
up."	1
	1
"What	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
genius!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
suddenly	1
exclaimed,	1
clenching	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
and	1
striking	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
it,	1
"and	1
what	1
luck	1
the	1
man	1
has!"	1
	1
"Buonaparte?"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
inquiringly,	1
puckering	1
up	1
his	1
forehead	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
witty.	1
"Buonaparte?"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
accentuating	1
the	1
u:	1
"I	1
think,	1
however,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
lays	1
down	1
laws	1
for	1
Austria	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
il	1
faut	1
lui	1
faire	1
grace	1
de	1
l'u!	1
*	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
adopt	1
an	1
innovation	1
and	1
call	1
him	1
simply	1
Bonaparte!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
"We	1
must	1
let	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
u!"	1
	1
"But	1
joking	1
apart,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
the	1
campaign	1
is	1
over?"	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
think.	1
Austria	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
it.	1
She	1
will	1
retaliate.	1
And	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
fooled	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
because	1
her	1
provinces	1
have	1
been	1
pillaged--they	1
say	1
the	1
Holy	1
Russian	1
army	1
loots	1
terribly--her	1
army	1
is	1
destroyed,	1
her	1
capital	1
taken,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
beaux	1
yeux	1
*	1
of	1
His	1
Sardinian	1
Majesty.	1
And	1
therefore--this	1
is	1
between	1
ourselves--I	1
instinctively	1
feel	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
being	1
deceived,	1
my	1
instinct	1
tells	1
me	1
of	1
negotiations	1
with	1
France	1
and	1
projects	1
for	1
peace,	1
a	1
secret	1
peace	1
concluded	1
separately."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Fine	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Impossible!"	1
cried	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
base."	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
live	1
we	1
shall	1
see,"	1
replied	1
Bilibin,	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
becoming	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
reached	1
the	1
room	1
prepared	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
shirt	1
on	1
the	1
feather	1
bed	1
with	1
its	1
warmed	1
and	1
fragrant	1
pillows,	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
tidings	1
was	1
far,	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
The	1
alliance	1
with	1
Prussia,	1
Austria's	1
treachery,	1
Bonaparte's	1
new	1
triumph,	1
tomorrow's	1
levee	1
and	1
parade,	1
and	1
the	1
audience	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
occupied	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
immediately	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
cannonading,	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
carriage	1
wheels	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
now	1
again	1
drawn	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
line	1
the	1
musketeers	1
were	1
descending	1
the	1
hill,	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
firing,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
his	1
heart	1
palpitating	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
forward	1
beside	1
Schmidt	1
with	1
the	1
bullets	1
merrily	1
whistling	1
all	1
around,	1
and	1
he	1
experienced	1
tenfold	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
living,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
since	1
childhood.	1
	1
He	1
woke	1
up...	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
all	1
happened!"	1
he	1
said,	1
and,	1
smiling	1
happily	1
to	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
child,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
deep,	1
youthful	1
slumber.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
he	1
woke	1
late.	1
Recalling	1
his	1
recent	1
impressions,	1
the	1
first	1
thought	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
that	1
today	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis;	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
the	1
polite	1
Austrian	1
adjutant,	1
Bilibin,	1
and	1
last	1
night's	1
conversation.	1
Having	1
dressed	1
for	1
his	1
attendance	1
at	1
court	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniform,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
worn	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
Bilibin's	1
study	1
fresh,	1
animated,	1
and	1
handsome,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
bandaged.	1
In	1
the	1
study	1
were	1
four	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps.	1
With	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
Kuragin,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
secretary	1
to	1
the	1
embassy,	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
already	1
acquainted.	1
Bilibin	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
assembled	1
at	1
Bilibin's	1
were	1
young,	1
wealthy,	1
gay	1
society	1
men,	1
who	1
here,	1
as	1
in	1
Vienna,	1
formed	1
a	1
special	1
set	1
which	1
Bilibin,	1
their	1
leader,	1
called	1
les	1
notres.	1
*	1
This	1
set,	1
consisting	1
almost	1
exclusively	1
of	1
diplomats,	1
evidently	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
interests	1
which	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
war	1
or	1
politics	1
but	1
related	1
to	1
high	1
society,	1
to	1
certain	1
women,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
official	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
service.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
received	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
themselves,	1
an	1
honor	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
extend	1
to	1
many.	1
From	1
politeness	1
and	1
to	1
start	1
conversation,	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
questions	1
about	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
talk	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
merry	1
jests	1
and	1
gossip.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Ours.	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
was,"	1
said	1
one,	1
telling	1
of	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
a	1
fellow	1
diplomat,	1
"that	1
the	1
Chancellor	1
told	1
him	1
flatly	1
that	1
his	1
appointment	1
to	1
London	1
was	1
a	1
promotion	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
to	1
regard	1
it.	1
Can	1
you	1
fancy	1
the	1
figure	1
he	1
cut?..."	1
	1
"But	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it,	1
gentlemen--I	1
am	1
giving	1
Kuragin	1
away	1
to	1
you--is	1
that	1
that	1
man	1
suffers,	1
and	1
this	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
wicked	1
fellow,	1
is	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
it!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte	1
was	1
lolling	1
in	1
a	1
lounge	1
chair	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
over	1
its	1
arm.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me	1
about	1
that!"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
Don	1
Juan!	1
You	1
serpent!"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
	1
"You,	1
Bolkonski,	1
don't	1
know,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that	1
all	1
the	1
atrocities	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
(I	1
nearly	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army)	1
are	1
nothing	1
compared	1
to	1
what	1
this	1
man	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
among	1
the	1
women!"	1
	1
"La	1
femme	1
est	1
la	1
compagne	1
de	1
l'homme,"	1
*	1
announced	1
Prince	1
Hippolyte,	1
and	1
began	1
looking	1
through	1
a	1
lorgnette	1
at	1
his	1
elevated	1
legs.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Woman	1
is	1
man's	1
companion."	1
	1
Bilibin	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
"ours"	1
burst	1
out	1
laughing	1
in	1
Hippolyte's	1
face,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
Hippolyte,	1
of	1
whom--he	1
had	1
to	1
admit--he	1
had	1
almost	1
been	1
jealous	1
on	1
his	1
wife's	1
account,	1
was	1
the	1
butt	1
of	1
this	1
set.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
I	1
must	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
treat,"	1
Bilibin	1
whispered	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Kuragin	1
is	1
exquisite	1
when	1
he	1
discusses	1
politics--you	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
gravity!"	1
	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
Hippolyte	1
and	1
wrinkling	1
his	1
forehead	1
began	1
talking	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
politics.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
gathered	1
round	1
these	1
two.	1
	1
"The	1
Berlin	1
cabinet	1
cannot	1
express	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
alliance,"	1
began	1
Hippolyte	1
gazing	1
round	1
with	1
importance	1
at	1
the	1
others,	1
"without	1
expressing...	1
as	1
in	1
its	1
last	1
note...	1
you	1
understand...	1
Besides,	1
unless	1
His	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Emperor	1
derogates	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
our	1
alliance...	1
	1
"Wait,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
finished..."	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
"I	1
believe	1
that	1
intervention	1
will	1
be	1
stronger	1
than	1
nonintervention.	1
And..."	1
he	1
paused.	1
"Finally	1
one	1
cannot	1
impute	1
the	1
nonreceipt	1
of	1
our	1
dispatch	1
of	1
November	1
18.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
it	1
will	1
end."	1
And	1
he	1
released	1
Bolkonski's	1
arm	1
to	1
indicate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
quite	1
finished.	1
	1
"Demosthenes,	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
pebble	1
thou	1
secretest	1
in	1
thy	1
golden	1
mouth!"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
and	1
the	1
mop	1
of	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
moved	1
with	1
satisfaction.	1
	1
Everybody	1
laughed,	1
and	1
Hippolyte	1
louder	1
than	1
anyone.	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
distressed,	1
and	1
breathed	1
painfully,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
the	1
wild	1
laughter	1
that	1
convulsed	1
his	1
usually	1
impassive	1
features.	1
	1
"Well	1
now,	1
gentlemen,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
"Bolkonski	1
is	1
my	1
guest	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
in	1
Brunn	1
itself.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
entertain	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
life	1
here.	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Vienna	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy,	1
but	1
here,	1
in	1
this	1
wretched	1
Moravian	1
hole,	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
difficult,	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
help	1
me.	1
Brunn's	1
attractions	1
must	1
be	1
shown	1
him.	1
You	1
can	1
undertake	1
the	1
theater,	1
I	1
society,	1
and	1
you,	1
Hippolyte,	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
women."	1
	1
"We	1
must	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
Amelie,	1
she's	1
exquisite!"	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
"ours,"	1
kissing	1
his	1
finger	1
tips.	1
	1
"In	1
general	1
we	1
must	1
turn	1
this	1
bloodthirsty	1
soldier	1
to	1
more	1
humane	1
interests,"	1
said	1
Bilibin.	1
	1
"I	1
shall	1
scarcely	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
your	1
hospitality,	1
gentlemen,	1
it	1
is	1
already	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
go,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Well,	1
au	1
revoir,	1
Bolkonski!	1
Au	1
revoir,	1
Prince!	1
Come	1
back	1
early	1
to	1
dinner,"	1
cried	1
several	1
voices.	1
"We'll	1
take	1
you	1
in	1
hand."	1
	1
"When	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
try	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
to	1
praise	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
provisions	1
are	1
supplied	1
and	1
the	1
routes	1
indicated,"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
hall.	1
	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
facts,	1
I	1
can't,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski,	1
smiling.	1
	1
"Well,	1
talk	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
anyway.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
giving	1
audiences,	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
talking	1
himself	1
and	1
can't	1
do	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see."	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
At	1
the	1
levee	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
Austrian	1
officers	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
to,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
merely	1
looked	1
fixedly	1
into	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
just	1
nodded	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
head.	1
But	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
adjutant	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
ceremoniously	1
informed	1
Bolkonski	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
desired	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
audience.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
received	1
him	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Before	1
the	1
conversation	1
began	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
seemed	1
confused	1
and	1
blushed	1
as	1
if	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
"Tell	1
me,	1
when	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin?"	1
he	1
asked	1
hurriedly.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
replied.	1
Then	1
followed	1
other	1
questions	1
just	1
as	1
simple:	1
"Was	1
Kutuzov	1
well?	1
When	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
Krems?"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
sole	1
aim	1
were	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
given	1
number	1
of	1
questions--the	1
answers	1
to	1
these	1
questions,	1
as	1
was	1
only	1
too	1
evident,	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
o'clock	1
did	1
the	1
battle	1
begin?"	1
asked	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
inform	1
Your	1
Majesty	1
at	1
what	1
o'clock	1
the	1
battle	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
at	1
Durrenstein,	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
our	1
attack	1
began	1
after	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski	1
growing	1
more	1
animated	1
and	1
expecting	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
reliable	1
account,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ready	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
and	1
had	1
seen.	1
But	1
the	1
Emperor	1
smiled	1
and	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"How	1
many	1
miles?"	1
	1
"From	1
where	1
to	1
where,	1
Your	1
Majesty?"	1
	1
"From	1
Durrenstein	1
to	1
Krems."	1
	1
"Three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
miles,	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
"The	1
French	1
have	1
abandoned	1
the	1
left	1
bank?"	1
	1
"According	1
to	1
the	1
scouts	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
crossed	1
on	1
rafts	1
during	1
the	1
night."	1
	1
"Is	1
there	1
sufficient	1
forage	1
in	1
Krems?"	1
	1
"Forage	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
supplied	1
to	1
the	1
extent..."	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"At	1
what	1
o'clock	1
was	1
General	1
Schmidt	1
killed?"	1
	1
"At	1
seven	1
o'clock,	1
I	1
believe."	1
	1
"At	1
seven	1
o'clock?	1
It's	1
very	1
sad,	1
very	1
sad!"	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
thanked	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
bowed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
withdrew	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
surrounded	1
by	1
courtiers	1
on	1
all	1
sides.	1
Everywhere	1
he	1
saw	1
friendly	1
looks	1
and	1
heard	1
friendly	1
words.	1
Yesterday's	1
adjutant	1
reproached	1
him	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
stayed	1
at	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
offered	1
him	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
The	1
Minister	1
of	1
War	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
Maria	1
Theresa	1
Order	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
grade,	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
conferring	1
on	1
him.	1
The	1
Empress'	1
chamberlain	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
Her	1
Majesty.	1
The	1
archduchess	1
also	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
to	1
answer,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
seconds	1
collected	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
Then	1
the	1
Russian	1
ambassador	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
Contrary	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
forecast	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
was	1
joyfully	1
received.	1
A	1
thanksgiving	1
service	1
was	1
arranged,	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
awarded	1
the	1
Grand	1
Cross	1
of	1
Maria	1
Theresa,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army	1
received	1
rewards.	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
invited	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
principal	1
Austrian	1
dignitaries.	1
Between	1
four	1
and	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
having	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
calls,	1
he	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
house	1
thinking	1
out	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
about	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Brunn.	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
vehicle	1
half	1
full	1
of	1
luggage.	1
Franz,	1
Bilibin's	1
man,	1
was	1
dragging	1
a	1
portmanteau	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
front	1
door.	1
	1
Before	1
returning	1
to	1
Bilibin's	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1
bookshop	1
to	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
some	1
books	1
for	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
shop.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
said	1
Franz,	1
with	1
difficulty	1
rolling	1
the	1
portmanteau	1
into	1
the	1
vehicle,	1
"we	1
are	1
to	1
move	1
on	1
still	1
farther.	1
The	1
scoundrel	1
is	1
again	1
at	1
our	1
heels!"	1
	1
"Eh?	1
What?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
Bilibin	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
His	1
usually	1
calm	1
face	1
showed	1
excitement.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
Confess	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
delightful,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"This	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge,	1
at	1
Vienna....	1
They	1
have	1
crossed	1
without	1
striking	1
a	1
blow!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
"But	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
every	1
coachman	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
knows?"	1
	1
"I	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
archduchess'.	1
I	1
heard	1
nothing	1
there."	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
didn't	1
see	1
that	1
everybody	1
is	1
packing	1
up?"	1
	1
"I	1
did	1
not...	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
all	1
about?"	1
inquired	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
impatiently.	1
	1
"What's	1
it	1
all	1
about?	1
Why,	1
the	1
French	1
have	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge	1
that	1
Auersperg	1
was	1
defending,	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
was	1
not	1
blown	1
up:	1
so	1
Murat	1
is	1
now	1
rushing	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Brunn	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two."	1
	1
"What?	1
Here?	1
But	1
why	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
mined?"	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
ask	1
you.	1
No	1
one,	1
not	1
even	1
Bonaparte,	1
knows	1
why."	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
	1
"But	1
if	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
crossed	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
too	1
is	1
lost?	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
cut	1
off,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,"	1
answered	1
Bilibin.	1
"Listen!	1
The	1
French	1
entered	1
Vienna	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you.	1
Very	1
well.	1
Next	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
yesterday,	1
those	1
gentlemen,	1
messieurs	1
les	1
marechaux,	1
*	1
Murat,	1
Lannes,	1
and	1
Belliard,	1
mount	1
and	1
ride	1
to	1
the	1
bridge.	1
(Observe	1
that	1
all	1
three	1
are	1
Gascons.)	1
'Gentlemen,'	1
says	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
'you	1
know	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge	1
is	1
mined	1
and	1
doubly	1
mined	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
menacing	1
fortifications	1
at	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
men	1
has	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
cross?	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
our	1
sovereign	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
if	1
we	1
take	1
this	1
bridge,	1
so	1
let	1
us	1
three	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
it!'	1
'Yes,	1
let's!'	1
say	1
the	1
others.	1
And	1
off	1
they	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
bridge,	1
cross	1
it,	1
and	1
now	1
with	1
their	1
whole	1
army	1
are	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Danube,	1
marching	1
on	1
us,	1
you,	1
and	1
your	1
lines	1
of	1
communication."	1
	1
	1
*	1
The	1
marshalls.	1
	1
"Stop	1
jesting,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
sadly	1
and	1
seriously.	1
This	1
news	1
grieved	1
him	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
pleased.	1
	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hopeless	1
situation	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
lead	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
position;	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
Toulon	1
that	1
would	1
lift	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
obscure	1
officers	1
and	1
offer	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
fame!	1
Listening	1
to	1
Bilibin	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
imagining	1
how	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
an	1
opinion	1
at	1
the	1
war	1
council	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
could	1
save	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
alone	1
would	1
be	1
entrusted	1
with	1
the	1
executing	1
of	1
the	1
plan.	1
	1
"Stop	1
this	1
jesting,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
jesting,"	1
Bilibin	1
went	1
on.	1
"Nothing	1
is	1
truer	1
or	1
sadder.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
ride	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge	1
alone	1
and	1
wave	1
white	1
handkerchiefs;	1
they	1
assure	1
the	1
officer	1
on	1
duty	1
that	1
they,	1
the	1
marshals,	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
Prince	1
Auersperg.	1
He	1
lets	1
them	1
enter	1
the	1
tête-de-pont.	1
*	1
They	1
spin	1
him	1
a	1
thousand	1
gasconades,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
war	1
is	1
over,	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
is	1
arranging	1
a	1
meeting	1
with	1
Bonaparte,	1
that	1
they	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
Prince	1
Auersperg,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
The	1
officer	1
sends	1
for	1
Auersperg;	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
embrace	1
the	1
officers,	1
crack	1
jokes,	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
cannon,	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
a	1
French	1
battalion	1
gets	1
to	1
the	1
bridge	1
unobserved,	1
flings	1
the	1
bags	1
of	1
incendiary	1
material	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
approaches	1
the	1
tête-de-pont.	1
At	1
length	1
appears	1
the	1
lieutenant	1
general,	1
our	1
dear	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
von	1
Mautern	1
himself.	1
'Dearest	1
foe!	1
Flower	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army,	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
Turkish	1
wars	1
Hostilities	1
are	1
ended,	1
we	1
can	1
shake	1
one	1
another's	1
hand....	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Napoleon	1
burns	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
make	1
Prince	1
Auersperg's	1
acquaintance.'	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
those	1
gentlemen,	1
Gascons	1
indeed,	1
so	1
bewildered	1
him	1
with	1
fine	1
words,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
rapidly	1
established	1
intimacy	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
marshals,	1
and	1
so	1
dazzled	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Murat's	1
mantle	1
and	1
ostrich	1
plumes,	1
qu'il	1
n'y	1
voit	1
que	1
du	1
feu,	1
et	1
oublie	1
celui	1
qu'il	1
devait	1
faire	1
faire	1
sur	1
l'ennemi!"	1
*(2)	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
animation	1
of	1
his	1
speech,	1
Bilibin	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
pause	1
after	1
this	1
mot	1
to	1
give	1
time	1
for	1
its	1
due	1
appreciation.	1
"The	1
French	1
battalion	1
rushes	1
to	1
the	1
bridgehead,	1
spikes	1
the	1
guns,	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
is	1
taken!	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
of	1
all,"	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
his	1
excitement	1
subsiding	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
story,	1
"is	1
that	1
the	1
sergeant	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
cannon	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
fire	1
the	1
mines	1
and	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
bridge,	1
this	1
sergeant,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
were	1
running	1
onto	1
the	1
bridge,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
fire,	1
but	1
Lannes	1
stayed	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
sergeant,	1
who	1
was	1
evidently	1
wiser	1
than	1
his	1
general,	1
goes	1
up	1
to	1
Auersperg	1
and	1
says:	1
'Prince,	1
you	1
are	1
being	1
deceived,	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
French!'	1
Murat,	1
seeing	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
lost	1
if	1
the	1
sergeant	1
is	1
allowed	1
to	1
speak,	1
turns	1
to	1
Auersperg	1
with	1
feigned	1
astonishment	1
(he	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
Gascon)	1
and	1
says:	1
'I	1
don't	1
recognize	1
the	1
world-famous	1
Austrian	1
discipline,	1
if	1
you	1
allow	1
a	1
subordinate	1
to	1
address	1
you	1
like	1
that!'	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
genius.	1
Prince	1
Auersperg	1
feels	1
his	1
dignity	1
at	1
stake	1
and	1
orders	1
the	1
sergeant	1
to	1
be	1
arrested.	1
Come,	1
you	1
must	1
own	1
that	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
Thabor	1
Bridge	1
is	1
delightful!	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
exactly	1
stupidity,	1
nor	1
rascality...."	1
	1
	1
*	1
Bridgehead.	1
	1
*	1
(2)	1
That	1
their	1
fire	1
gets	1
into	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
he	1
forgets	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
firing	1
at	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
treachery,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
vividly	1
imagining	1
the	1
gray	1
overcoats,	1
wounds,	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
gunpowder,	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
that	1
awaited	1
him.	1
	1
"Not	1
that	1
either.	1
That	1
puts	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
too	1
bad	1
a	1
light,"	1
replied	1
Bilibin.	1
"It's	1
not	1
treachery	1
nor	1
rascality	1
nor	1
stupidity:	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
at	1
Ulm...	1
it	1
is..."--he	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
right	1
expression.	1
"C'est...	1
c'est	1
du	1
Mack.	1
Nous	1
sommes	1
mackes	1
(It	1
is...	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
Mack.	1
We	1
are	1
Macked),"	1
he	1
concluded,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
produced	1
a	1
good	1
epigram,	1
a	1
fresh	1
one	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
repeated.	1
His	1
hitherto	1
puckered	1
brow	1
became	1
smooth	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
smile	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
nails.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to?"	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
toward	1
his	1
room.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
away."	1
	1
"Where	1
to?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
stay	1
another	1
two	1
days?"	1
	1
"But	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
at	1
once."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
after	1
giving	1
directions	1
about	1
his	1
departure	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
room.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
mon	1
cher,"	1
said	1
Bilibin	1
following	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you.	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
going?"	1
	1
And	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
conclusiveness	1
of	1
his	1
opinion	1
all	1
the	1
wrinkles	1
vanished	1
from	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
no	1
reply.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
your	1
duty	1
to	1
gallop	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
danger.	1
I	1
understand	1
that.	1
Mon	1
cher,	1
it	1
is	1
heroism!"	1
	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"But	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
philosopher,	1
be	1
a	1
consistent	1
one,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
duty,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself.	1
Leave	1
it	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
fit	1
for	1
anything	1
else....	1
You	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
dismissed	1
from	1
here;	1
therefore,	1
you	1
can	1
stay	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
us	1
wherever	1
our	1
ill	1
luck	1
takes	1
us.	1
They	1
say	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
and	1
Olmutz	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
decent	1
town.	1
You	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
travel	1
comfortably	1
in	1
my	1
caleche."	1
	1
"Do	1
stop	1
joking,	1
Bilibin,"	1
cried	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
speaking	1
sincerely	1
as	1
a	1
friend!	1
Consider!	1
Where	1
and	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
when	1
you	1
might	1
remain	1
here?	1
You	1
are	1
faced	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things,"	1
and	1
the	1
skin	1
over	1
his	1
left	1
temple	1
puckered,	1
"either	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
reach	1
your	1
regiment	1
before	1
peace	1
is	1
concluded,	1
or	1
you	1
will	1

and	1
disgrace	1
with	1
Kutuzov's	1
whole	1
army."	1
	1
And	1
Bilibin	1
unwrinkled	1
his	1
temple,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
dilemma	1
was	1
insoluble.	1
	1
"I	1
cannot	1
argue	1
about	1
it,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
coldly,	1
but	1
he	1
thought:	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
hero!"	1
said	1
Bilibin.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
That	1
same	1
night,	1
having	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
Minister	1
of	1
War,	1
Bolkonski	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
rejoin	1
the	1
army,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
and	1
fearing	1
to	1
be	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Krems.	1
	1
In	1
Brunn	1
everybody	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
packing	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
baggage	1
was	1
already	1
being	1
dispatched	1
to	1
Olmutz.	1
Near	1
Hetzelsdorf	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
struck	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
was	1
moving	1
with	1
great	1
haste	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
disorder.	1
The	1
road	1
was	1
so	1
obstructed	1
with	1
carts	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
carriage.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
a	1
horse	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack	1
from	1
a	1
Cossack	1
commander,	1
and	1
hungry	1
and	1
weary,	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
past	1
the	1
baggage	1
wagons,	1
rode	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
luggage.	1
Very	1
sinister	1
reports	1
of	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
reached	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
their	1
disorderly	1
flight	1
confirmed	1
these	1
rumors.	1
	1
"Cette	1
armee	1
russe	1
que	1
l'or	1
de	1
l'Angleterre	1
a	1
transportee	1
des	1
extremites	1
de	1
l'univers,	1
nous	1
allons	1
lui	1
faire	1
eprouver	1
le	1
meme	1
sort--(le	1
sort	1
de	1
l'armee	1
d'Ulm)."	1
*	1
He	1
remembered	1
these	1
words	1
in	1
Bonaparte's	1
address	1
to	1
his	1
army	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
they	1
awoke	1
in	1
him	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
his	1
hero,	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride,	1
and	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
glory.	1
"And	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
nothing	1
left	1
but	1
to	1
die?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Well,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
it	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
others."	1
	1
	1
*	1
"That	1
Russian	1
army	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
from	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
English	1
gold,	1
we	1
shall	1
cause	1
to	1
share	1
the	1
same	1
fate--(the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
at	1
Ulm)."	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
with	1
disdain	1
at	1
the	1
endless	1
confused	1
mass	1
of	1
detachments,	1
carts,	1
guns,	1
artillery,	1
and	1
again	1
baggage	1
wagons	1
and	1
vehicles	1
of	1
all	1
kinds	1
overtaking	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
blocking	1
the	1
muddy	1
road,	1
three	1
and	1
sometimes	1
four	1
abreast.	1
From	1
all	1
sides,	1
behind	1
and	1
before,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
ear	1
could	1
reach,	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
wheels,	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
carts	1
and	1
gun	1
carriages,	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses,	1
the	1
crack	1
of	1
whips,	1
shouts,	1
the	1
urging	1
of	1
horses,	1
and	1
the	1
swearing	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
orderlies,	1
and	1
officers.	1
All	1
along	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
fallen	1
horses	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
some	1
flayed,	1
some	1
not,	1
and	1
broken-down	1
carts	1
beside	1
which	1
solitary	1
soldiers	1
sat	1
waiting	1
for	1
something,	1
and	1
again	1
soldiers	1
straggling	1
from	1
their	1
companies,	1
crowds	1
of	1
whom	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
neighboring	1
villages,	1
or	1
returned	1
from	1
them	1
dragging	1
sheep,	1
fowls,	1
hay,	1
and	1
bulging	1
sacks.	1
At	1
each	1
ascent	1
or	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
crowds	1
were	1
yet	1
denser	1
and	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
shouting	1
more	1
incessant.	1
Soldiers	1
floundering	1
knee-deep	1
in	1
mud	1
pushed	1
the	1
guns	1
and	1
wagons	1
themselves.	1
Whips	1
cracked,	1
hoofs	1
slipped,	1
traces	1
broke,	1
and	1
lungs	1
were	1
strained	1
with	1
shouting.	1
The	1
officers	1
directing	1
the	1
march	1
rode	1
backward	1
and	1
forward	1
between	1
the	1
carts.	1
Their	1
voices	1
were	1
but	1
feebly	1
heard	1
amid	1
the	1
uproar	1
and	1
one	1
saw	1
by	1
their	1
faces	1
that	1
they	1
despaired	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
checking	1
this	1
disorder.	1
	1
"Here	1
is	1
our	1
dear	1
Orthodox	1
Russian	1
army,"	1
thought	1
Bolkonski,	1
recalling	1
Bilibin's	1
words.	1
	1
Wishing	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was,	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
convoy.	1
Directly	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
came	1
a	1
strange	1
one-horse	1
vehicle,	1
evidently	1
rigged	1
up	1
by	1
soldiers	1
out	1
of	1
any	1
available	1
materials	1
and	1
looking	1
like	1
something	1
between	1
a	1
cart,	1
a	1
cabriolet,	1
and	1
a	1
caleche.	1
A	1
soldier	1
was	1
driving,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
enveloped	1
in	1
shawls	1
sat	1
behind	1
the	1
apron	1
under	1
the	1
leather	1
hood	1
of	1
the	1
vehicle.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
putting	1
his	1
question	1
to	1
a	1
soldier	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
the	1
desperate	1
shrieks	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
vehicle.	1
An	1
officer	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
transport	1
was	1
beating	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
driving	1
the	1
woman's	1
vehicle	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
ahead	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
the	1
strokes	1
of	1
his	1
whip	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
apron	1
of	1
the	1
equipage.	1
The	1
woman	1
screamed	1
piercingly.	1
Seeing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
she	1
leaned	1
out	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
apron	1
and,	1
waving	1
her	1
thin	1
arms	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
woolen	1
shawl,	1
cried:	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!	1
Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!...	1
For	1
heaven's	1
sake...	1
Protect	1
me!	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
us?	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
Seventh	1
Chasseurs....	1
They	1
won't	1
let	1
us	1
pass,	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
have	1
lost	1
our	1
people..."	1
	1
"I'll	1
flatten	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
pancake!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
angry	1
officer	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"Turn	1
back	1
with	1
your	1
slut!"	1
	1
"Mr.	1
Aide-de-camp!	1
Help	1
me!...	1
What	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
mean?"	1
screamed	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife.	1
	1
"Kindly	1
let	1
this	1
cart	1
pass.	1
Don't	1
you	1
see	1
it's	1
a	1
woman?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
officer.	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
glanced	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
turned	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
"I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
push	1
on!...	1
Back!"	1
	1
"Let	1
them	1
pass,	1
I	1
tell	1
you!"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
compressing	1
his	1
lips.	1
	1
"And	1
who	1
are	1
you?"	1
cried	1
the	1
officer,	1
turning	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
tipsy	1
rage,	1
"who	1
are	1
you?	1
Are	1
you	1
in	1
command	1
here?	1
Eh?	1
I	1
am	1
commander	1
here,	1
not	1
you!	1
Go	1
back	1
or	1
I'll	1
flatten	1
you	1
into	1
a	1
pancake,"	1
repeated	1
he.	1
This	1
expression	1
evidently	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
"That	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
snub	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
aide-de-camp,"	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
behind.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
officer	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
senseless,	1
tipsy	1
rage	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
saying.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
championship	1
of	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife	1
in	1
her	1
queer	1
trap	1
might	1
expose	1
him	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
dreaded	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
world--to	1
ridicule;	1
but	1
his	1
instinct	1
urged	1
him	1
on.	1
Before	1
the	1
officer	1
finished	1
his	1
sentence	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
face	1
distorted	1
with	1
fury,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
riding	1
whip.	1
	1
"Kind...ly	1
let--them--pass!"	1
	1
The	1
officer	1
flourished	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
hastily	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
"It's	1
all	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
these	1
fellows	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
that	1
there's	1
this	1
disorder,"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
"Do	1
as	1
you	1
like."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes	1
rode	1
hastily	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
calling	1
him	1
her	1
deliverer,	1
and	1
recalling	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
disgust	1
the	1
minutest	1
details	1
of	1
this	1
humiliating	1
scene	1
he	1
galloped	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was.	1
	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
village	1
he	1
dismounted	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
nearest	1
house,	1
intending	1
to	1
rest	1
if	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
eat	1
something,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
sort	1
out	1
the	1
stinging	1
and	1
tormenting	1
thoughts	1
that	1
confused	1
his	1
mind.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
scoundrels	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
army,"	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
house,	1
when	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
name.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
round.	1
Nesvitski's	1
handsome	1
face	1
looked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
window.	1
Nesvitski,	1
moving	1
his	1
moist	1
lips	1
as	1
he	1
chewed	1
something,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
his	1
arm,	1
called	1
him	1
to	1
enter.	1
	1
"Bolkonski!	1
Bolkonski!...	1
Don't	1
you	1
hear?	1
Eh?	1
Come	1
quick..."	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
Entering	1
the	1
house,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
another	1
adjutant	1
having	1
something	1
to	1
eat.	1
They	1
hastily	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
him	1
asking	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
news.	1
On	1
their	1
familiar	1
faces	1
he	1
read	1
agitation	1
and	1
alarm.	1
This	1
was	1
particularly	1
noticeable	1
on	1
Nesvitski's	1
usually	1
laughing	1
countenance.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
commander-in-chief?"	1
asked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Here,	1
in	1
that	1
house,"	1
answered	1
the	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Well,	1
is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
it's	1
peace	1
and	1
capitulation?"	1
asked	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
ask	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
except	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
I	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
here."	1
	1
"And	1
we,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy!	1
It's	1
terrible!	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
Mack,	1
we're	1
getting	1
it	1
still	1
worse,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"But	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
eat."	1
	1
"You	1
won't	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
either	1
your	1
baggage	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
now,	1
Prince.	1
And	1
God	1
only	1
knows	1
where	1
your	1
man	1
Peter	1
is,"	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
adjutant.	1
	1
"Where	1
are	1
headquarters?"	1
	1
"We	1
are	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
Znaim."	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
all	1
I	1
need	1
into	1
packs	1
for	1
two	1
horses,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
"They've	1
made	1
up	1
splendid	1
packs	1
for	1
me--fit	1
to	1
cross	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains	1
with.	1
It's	1
a	1
bad	1
lookout,	1
old	1
fellow!	1
But	1
what's	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
you?	1
You	1
must	1
be	1
ill	1
to	1
shiver	1
like	1
that,"	1
he	1
added,	1
noticing	1
that	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
winced	1
as	1
at	1
an	1
electric	1
shock.	1
	1
"It's	1
nothing,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
remembered	1
his	1
recent	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
doctor's	1
wife	1
and	1
the	1
convoy	1
officer.	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
doing	1
here?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
	1
"I	1
can't	1
make	1
out	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Nesvitski.	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
is	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
abominable,	1
abominable,	1
quite	1
abominable!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
was.	1
	1
Passing	1
by	1
Kutuzov's	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
exhausted	1
saddle	1
horses	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
with	1
their	1
Cossacks	1
who	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
together,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
entered	1
the	1
passage.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself,	1
he	1
was	1
told,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Weyrother.	1
Weyrother	1
was	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
succeeded	1
Schmidt.	1
In	1
the	1
passage	1
little	1
Kozlovski	1
was	1
squatting	1
on	1
his	1
heels	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
clerk.	1
The	1
clerk,	1
with	1
cuffs	1
turned	1
up,	1
was	1
hastily	1
writing	1
at	1
a	1
tub	1
turned	1
bottom	1
upwards.	1
Kozlovski's	1
face	1
looked	1
worn--he	1
too	1
had	1
evidently	1
not	1
slept	1
all	1
night.	1
He	1
glanced	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
nod	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Second	1
line...	1
have	1
you	1
written	1
it?"	1
he	1
continued	1
dictating	1
to	1
the	1
clerk.	1
"The	1
Kiev	1
Grenadiers,	1
Podolian..."	1
	1
"One	1
can't	1
write	1
so	1
fast,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
said	1
the	1
clerk,	1
glancing	1
angrily	1
and	1
disrespectfully	1
at	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
voice,	1
excited	1
and	1
dissatisfied,	1
interrupted	1
by	1
another,	1
an	1
unfamiliar	1
voice.	1
From	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
these	1
voices,	1
the	1
inattentive	1
way	1
Kozlovski	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
the	1
disrespectful	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
exhausted	1
clerk,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
clerk	1
and	1
Kozlovski	1
were	1
squatting	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
by	1
a	1
tub	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
noisy	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
holding	1
the	1
horses	1
near	1
the	1
window,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
important	1
and	1
disastrous	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
happen.	1
	1
He	1
turned	1
to	1
Kozlovski	1
with	1
urgent	1
questions.	1
	1
"Immediately,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Kozlovski.	1
"Dispositions	1
for	1
Bagration."	1
	1
"What	1
about	1
capitulation?"	1
	1
"Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
Orders	1
are	1
issued	1
for	1
a	1
battle."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
moved	1
toward	1
the	1
door	1
from	1
whence	1
voices	1
were	1
heard.	1
Just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
it	1
the	1
sounds	1
ceased,	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
eagle	1
nose	1
and	1
puffy	1
face	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stood	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Kutuzov	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
one	1
sound	1
eye	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
preoccupied	1
with	1
thoughts	1
and	1
anxieties	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
oblivious	1
of	1
his	1
presence.	1
He	1
looked	1
straight	1
at	1
his	1
adjutant's	1
face	1
without	1
recognizing	1
him.	1
	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
finished?"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Kozlovski.	1
	1
"One	1
moment,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
Bagration,	1
a	1
gaunt	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
with	1
a	1
firm,	1
impassive	1
face	1
of	1
Oriental	1
type,	1
came	1
out	1
after	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
the	1
honor	1
to	1
present	1
myself,"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rather	1
loudly,	1
handing	1
Kutuzov	1
an	1
envelope.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
from	1
Vienna?	1
Very	1
good.	1
Later,	1
later!"	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch	1
with	1
Bagration.	1
	1
"Well,	1
good-by,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
"My	1
blessing,	1
and	1
may	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
great	1
endeavor!"	1
	1
His	1
face	1
suddenly	1
softened	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
With	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
he	1
drew	1
Bagration	1
toward	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
right,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
ring,	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
over	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
gesture	1
evidently	1
habitual,	1
offering	1
his	1
puffy	1
cheek,	1
but	1
Bagration	1
kissed	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
neck	1
instead.	1
	1
"Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you!"	1
Kutuzov	1
repeated	1
and	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
carriage.	1
"Get	1
in	1
with	1
me,"	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
here.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
detachment."	1
	1
"Get	1
in,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
and	1
noticing	1
that	1
Bolkonski	1
still	1
delayed,	1
he	1
added:	1
"I	1
need	1
good	1
officers	1
myself,	1
need	1
them	1
myself!"	1
	1
They	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
and	1
drove	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"There	1
is	1
still	1
much,	1
much	1
before	1
us,"	1
he	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
man's	1
penetration	1
he	1
understood	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
Bolkonski's	1
mind.	1
"If	1
a	1
tenth	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
detachment	1
returns	1
I	1
shall	1
thank	1
God,"	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
speaking	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kutuzov's	1
face	1
only	1
a	1
foot	1
distant	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
involuntarily	1
noticed	1
the	1
carefully	1
washed	1
seams	1
of	1
the	1
scar	1
near	1
his	1
temple,	1
where	1
an	1
Ismail	1
bullet	1
had	1
pierced	1
his	1
skull,	1
and	1
the	1
empty	1
eye	1
socket.	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
speak	1
so	1
calmly	1
of	1
those	1
men's	1
death,"	1
thought	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
why	1
I	1
beg	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
that	1
detachment,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
saying,	1
and	1
sat	1
plunged	1
in	1
thought.	1
Five	1
minutes	1
later,	1
gently	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
soft	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
agitation	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
With	1
delicate	1
irony	1
he	1
questioned	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
about	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
about	1
the	1
remarks	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
at	1
court	1
concerning	1
the	1
Krems	1
affair,	1
and	1
about	1
some	1
ladies	1
they	1
both	1
knew.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
On	1
November	1
1	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
received,	1
through	1
a	1
spy,	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
army	1
he	1
commanded	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
almost	1
hopeless	1
position.	1
The	1
spy	1
reported	1
that	1
the	1
French,	1
after	1
crossing	1
the	1
bridge	1
at	1
Vienna,	1
were	1
advancing	1
in	1
immense	1
force	1
upon	1
Kutuzov's	1
line	1
of	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
that	1
were	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Krems,	1
Napoleon's	1
army	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
men	1
would	1
cut	1
him	1
off	1
completely	1
and	1
surround	1
his	1
exhausted	1
army	1
of	1
forty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
Mack	1
at	1
Ulm.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
road	1
connecting	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
march	1
with	1
no	1
road	1
into	1
unknown	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains,	1
defending	1
himself	1
against	1
superior	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
abandoning	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
junction	1
with	1
Buxhowden.	1
If	1
Kutuzov	1
decided	1
to	1
retreat	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Krems	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
the	1
troops	1
arriving	1
from	1
Russia,	1
he	1
risked	1
being	1
forestalled	1
on	1
that	1
road	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
and	1
encumbered	1
by	1
his	1
baggage	1
and	1
transport,	1
having	1
to	1
accept	1
battle	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
against	1
an	1
enemy	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
strong,	1
who	1
would	1
hem	1
him	1
in	1
from	1
two	1
sides.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
chose	1
this	1
latter	1
course.	1
	1
The	1
French,	1
the	1
spy	1
reported,	1
having	1
crossed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
were	1
advancing	1
by	1
forced	1
marches	1
toward	1
Znaim,	1
which	1
lay	1
sixty-six	1
miles	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
retreat.	1
If	1
he	1
reached	1
Znaim	1
before	1
the	1
French,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
hope	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army;	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
French	1
forestall	1
him	1
at	1
Znaim	1
meant	1
the	1
exposure	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
to	1
a	1
disgrace	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Ulm,	1
or	1
to	1
utter	1
destruction.	1
But	1
to	1
forestall	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
impossible.	1
The	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
from	1
Vienna	1
to	1
Znaim	1
was	1
shorter	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
Russians	1
from	1
Krems	1
to	1
Znaim.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
news,	1
Kutuzov	1
sent	1
Bagration's	1
vanguard,	1
four	1
thousand	1
strong,	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
across	1
the	1
hills	1
from	1
the	1
Krems-Znaim	1
to	1
the	1
Vienna-Znaim	1
road.	1
Bagration	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
march	1
without	1
resting,	1
and	1
to	1
halt	1
facing	1
Vienna	1
with	1
Znaim	1
to	1
his	1
rear,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
succeeded	1
in	1
forestalling	1
the	1
French	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
delay	1
them	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible.	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
transport	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Znaim.	1
	1
Marching	1
thirty	1
miles	1
that	1
stormy	1
night	1
across	1
roadless	1
hills,	1
with	1
his	1
hungry,	1
ill-shod	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
losing	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
his	1
men	1
as	1
stragglers	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
Bagration	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
Vienna-Znaim	1
road	1
at	1
Hollabrunn	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
ahead	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
Hollabrunn	1
from	1
Vienna.	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
transport	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
march	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
Znaim.	1
Hence	1
Bagration	1
with	1
his	1
four	1
thousand	1
hungry,	1
exhausted	1
men	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
detain	1
for	1
days	1
the	1
whole	1
enemy	1
army	1
that	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
Hollabrunn,	1
which	1
was	1
clearly	1
impossible.	1
But	1
a	1
freak	1
of	1
fate	1
made	1
the	1
impossible	1
possible.	1
The	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
trick	1
that	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
without	1
a	1
fight	1
led	1
Murat	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
deceive	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
way.	1
Meeting	1
Bagration's	1
weak	1
detachment	1
on	1
the	1
Znaim	1
road	1
he	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Kutuzov's	1
whole	1
army.	1
To	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
crush	1
it	1
absolutely	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
troops	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
Vienna,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
offered	1
a	1
three	1
days'	1
truce	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
both	1
armies	1
should	1
remain	1
in	1
position	1
without	1
moving.	1
Murat	1
declared	1
that	1
negotiations	1
for	1
peace	1
were	1
already	1
proceeding,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
therefore	1
offered	1
this	1
truce	1
to	1
avoid	1
unnecessary	1
bloodshed.	1
Count	1
Nostitz,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general	1
occupying	1
the	1
advanced	1
posts,	1
believed	1
Murat's	1
emissary	1
and	1
retired,	1
leaving	1
Bagration's	1
division	1
exposed.	1
Another	1
emissary	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
Russian	1
line	1
to	1
announce	1
the	1
peace	1
negotiations	1
and	1
to	1
offer	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
the	1
three	1
days'	1
truce.	1
Bagration	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
authorized	1
either	1
to	1
accept	1
or	1
refuse	1
a	1
truce	1
and	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutant	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
report	1
the	1
offer	1
he	1
had	1
received.	1
	1
A	1
truce	1
was	1
Kutuzov's	1
sole	1
chance	1
of	1
gaining	1
time,	1
giving	1
Bagration's	1
exhausted	1
troops	1
some	1
rest,	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
transport	1
and	1
heavy	1
convoys	1
(whose	1
movements	1
were	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
French)	1
advance	1
if	1
but	1
one	1
stage	1
nearer	1
Znaim.	1
The	1
offer	1
of	1
a	1
truce	1
gave	1
the	1
only,	1
and	1
a	1
quite	1
unexpected,	1
chance	1
of	1
saving	1
the	1
army.	1
On	1
receiving	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
immediately	1
dispatched	1
Adjutant	1
General	1
Wintzingerode,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
him,	1
to	1
the	1
enemy	1
camp.	1
Wintzingerode	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
the	1
truce	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
offer	1
terms	1
of	1
capitulation,	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
Kutuzov	1
sent	1
his	1
adjutants	1
back	1
to	1
hasten	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
baggage	1
trains	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
army	1
along	1
the	1
Krems-Znaim	1
road.	1
Bagration's	1
exhausted	1
and	1
hungry	1
detachment,	1
which	1
alone	1
covered	1
this	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
had	1
to	1
remain	1
stationary	1
in	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
eight	1
times	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
itself.	1
	1
Kutuzov's	1
expectations	1
that	1
the	1
proposals	1
of	1
capitulation	1
(which	1
were	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
binding)	1
might	1
give	1
time	1
for	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
transport	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
Murat's	1
mistake	1
would	1
very	1
soon	1
be	1
discovered,	1
proved	1
correct.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Bonaparte	1
(who	1
was	1
at	1
Schonbrunn,	1
sixteen	1
miles	1
from	1
Hollabrunn)	1
received	1
Murat's	1
dispatch	1
with	1
the	1
proposal	1
of	1
a	1
truce	1
and	1
a	1
capitulation,	1
he	1
detected	1
a	1
ruse	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
to	1
Murat:	1
	1
Schonbrunn,	1
25th	1
Brumaire,	1
1805,	1
	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
	1
To	1
PRINCE	1
MURAT,	1
	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
displeasure.	1
You	1
command	1
only	1
my	1
advance	1
guard,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
arrange	1
an	1
armistice	1
without	1
my	1
order.	1
You	1
are	1
causing	1
me	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
a	1
campaign.	1
Break	1
the	1
armistice	1
immediately	1
and	1
march	1
on	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Inform	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
signed	1
that	1
capitulation	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia	1
has	1
that	1
right.	1
	1
If,	1
however,	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Russia	1
ratifies	1
that	1
convention,	1
I	1
will	1
ratify	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
trick.	1
March	1
on,	1
destroy	1
the	1
Russian	1
army....	1
You	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
seize	1
its	1
baggage	1
and	1
artillery.	1
	1
The	1
Russian	1
Emperor's	1
aide-de-camp	1
is	1
an	1
impostor.	1
Officers	1
are	1
nothing	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
powers;	1
this	1
one	1
had	1
none....	1
The	1
Austrians	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
tricked	1
at	1
the	1
crossing	1
of	1
the	1
Vienna	1
bridge,	1
you	1
are	1
letting	1
yourself	1
be	1
tricked	1
by	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
NAPOLEON	1
	1
Bonaparte's	1
adjutant	1
rode	1
full	1
gallop	1
with	1
this	1
menacing	1
letter	1
to	1
Murat.	1
Bonaparte	1
himself,	1
not	1
trusting	1
to	1
his	1
generals,	1
moved	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Guards	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle,	1
afraid	1
of	1
letting	1
a	1
ready	1
victim	1
escape,	1
and	1
Bagration's	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
merrily	1
lighted	1
campfires,	1
dried	1
and	1
warmed	1
themselves,	1
cooked	1
their	1
porridge	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
or	1
imagined	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
Between	1
three	1
and	1
four	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
persisted	1
in	1
his	1
request	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
arrived	1
at	1
Grunth	1
and	1
reported	1
himself	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
Bonaparte's	1
adjutant	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
reached	1
Murat's	1
detachment	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
begun.	1
In	1
Bagration's	1
detachment	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
position	1
of	1
affairs.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
peace	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
its	1
possibility;	1
others	1
talked	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
but	1
also	1
disbelieved	1
in	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
an	1
engagement.	1
Bagration,	1
knowing	1
Bolkonski	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
favorite	1
and	1
trusted	1
adjutant,	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
distinction	1
and	1
special	1
marks	1
of	1
favor,	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
an	1
engagement	1
that	1
day	1
or	1
the	1
next,	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
full	1
liberty	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
him	1
during	1
the	1
battle	1
or	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
rearguard	1
and	1
have	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
retreat,	1
"which	1
is	1
also	1
very	1
important."	1
	1
"However,	1
there	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
an	1
engagement	1
today,"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
reassure	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
little	1
staff	1
dandies	1
sent	1
to	1
earn	1
a	1
medal	1
he	1
can	1
get	1
his	1
reward	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
rearguard,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
wishes	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
me,	1
let	1
him...	1
he'll	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
here	1
if	1
he's	1
a	1
brave	1
officer,"	1
thought	1
Bagration.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
without	1
replying,	1
asked	1
the	1
prince's	1
permission	1
to	1
ride	1
round	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
forces,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
his	1
bearings	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
execute	1
an	1
order.	1
The	1
officer	1
on	1
duty,	1
a	1
handsome,	1
elegantly	1
dressed	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
diamond	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
forefinger,	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
speaking	1
French	1
though	1
he	1
spoke	1
it	1
badly,	1
offered	1
to	1
conduct	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
On	1
all	1
sides	1
they	1
saw	1
rain-soaked	1
officers	1
with	1
dejected	1
faces	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
seeking	1
something,	1
and	1
soldiers	1
dragging	1
doors,	1
benches,	1
and	1
fencing	1
from	1
the	1
village.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
Prince!	1
We	1
can't	1
stop	1
those	1
fellows,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
"The	1
officers	1
don't	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
hand.	1
And	1
there,"	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
a	1
sutler's	1
tent,	1
"they	1
crowd	1
in	1
and	1
sit.	1
This	1
morning	1
I	1
turned	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
and	1
now	1
look,	1
it's	1
full	1
again.	1
I	1
must	1
go	1
there,	1
Prince,	1
and	1
scare	1
them	1
a	1
bit.	1
It	1
won't	1
take	1
a	1
moment."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
let's	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
myself	1
a	1
roll	1
and	1
some	1
cheese,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
eat	1
anything.	1
	1
"Why	1
didn't	1
you	1
mention	1
it,	1
Prince?	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
offered	1
you	1
something."	1
	1
They	1
dismounted	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
tent.	1
Several	1
officers,	1
with	1
flushed	1
and	1
weary	1
faces,	1
were	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
	1
"Now	1
what	1
does	1
this	1
mean,	1
gentlemen?"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
in	1
the	1
reproachful	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
more	1
than	1
once.	1
"You	1
know	1
it	1
won't	1
do	1
to	1
leave	1
your	1
posts	1
like	1
this.	1
The	1
prince	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
leave	1
his	1
post.	1
Now	1
you,	1
Captain,"	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
thin,	1
dirty	1
little	1
artillery	1
officer	1
who	1
without	1
his	1
boots	1
(he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
canteen	1
keeper	1
to	1
dry),	1
in	1
only	1
his	1
stockings,	1
rose	1
when	1
they	1
entered,	1
smiling	1
not	1
altogether	1
comfortably.	1
	1
"Well,	1
aren't	1
you	1
ashamed	1
of	1
yourself,	1
Captain	1
Tushin?"	1
he	1
continued.	1
"One	1
would	1
think	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
artillery	1
officer	1
you	1
would	1
set	1
a	1
good	1
example,	1
yet	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
without	1
your	1
boots!	1
The	1
alarm	1
will	1
be	1
sounded	1
and	1
you'll	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
pretty	1
position	1
without	1
your	1
boots!"	1
(The	1
staff	1
officer	1
smiled.)	1
"Kindly	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
posts,	1
gentlemen,	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
all!"	1
he	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
command.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
smiled	1
involuntarily	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer	1
Tushin,	1
who	1
silent	1
and	1
smiling,	1
shifting	1
from	1
one	1
stockinged	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
glanced	1
inquiringly	1
with	1
his	1
large,	1
intelligent,	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
	1
"The	1
soldiers	1
say	1
it	1
feels	1
easier	1
without	1
boots,"	1
said	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
smiling	1
shyly	1
in	1
his	1
uncomfortable	1
position,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
adopt	1
a	1
jocular	1
tone.	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
his	1
jest	1
was	1
unacceptable	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
off.	1
He	1
grew	1
confused.	1
	1
"Kindly	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
posts,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
trying	1
to	1
preserve	1
his	1
gravity.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
glanced	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer's	1
small	1
figure.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
peculiar	1
about	1
it,	1
quite	1
unsoldierly,	1
rather	1
comic,	1
but	1
extremely	1
attractive.	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
mounted	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
rode	1
on.	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
beyond	1
the	1
village,	1
continually	1
meeting	1
and	1
overtaking	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
various	1
regiments,	1
they	1
saw	1
on	1
their	1
left	1
some	1
entrenchments	1
being	1
thrown	1
up,	1
the	1
freshly	1
dug	1
clay	1
of	1
which	1
showed	1
up	1
red.	1
Several	1
battalions	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
in	1
their	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
despite	1
the	1
cold	1
wind,	1
swarmed	1
in	1
these	1
earthworks	1
like	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
white	1
ants;	1
spadefuls	1
of	1
red	1
clay	1
were	1
continually	1
being	1
thrown	1
up	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
bank	1
by	1
unseen	1
hands.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
rode	1
up,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
entrenchment,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
again.	1
Just	1
behind	1
it	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
some	1
dozens	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
continually	1
replaced	1
by	1
others,	1
who	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
entrenchment.	1
They	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
noses	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
horses	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
poisoned	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
these	1
latrines.	1
	1
"Voila	1
l'agrement	1
des	1
camps,	1
monsieur	1
le	1
Prince,"	1
*	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
one	1
gets	1
in	1
camp,	1
Prince."	1
	1
They	1
rode	1
up	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill.	1
From	1
there	1
the	1
French	1
could	1
already	1
be	1
seen.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped	1
and	1
began	1
examining	1
the	1
position.	1
	1
"That's	1
our	1
battery,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
indicating	1
the	1
highest	1
point.	1
"It's	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
queer	1
fellow	1
we	1
saw	1
without	1
his	1
boots.	1
You	1
can	1
see	1
everything	1
from	1
there;	1
let's	1
go	1
there,	1
Prince."	1
	1
"Thank	1
you	1
very	1
much,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
wishing	1
to	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
this	1
staff	1
officer's	1
company,	1
"please	1
don't	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
further."	1
	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
remained	1
behind	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
on	1
alone.	1
	1
The	1
farther	1
forward	1
and	1
nearer	1
the	1
enemy	1
he	1
went,	1
the	1
more	1
orderly	1
and	1
cheerful	1
were	1
the	1
troops.	1
The	1
greatest	1
disorder	1
and	1
depression	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
baggage	1
train	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
that	1
morning	1
on	1
the	1
Znaim	1
road	1
seven	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
French.	1
At	1
Grunth	1
also	1
some	1
apprehension	1
and	1
alarm	1
could	1
be	1
felt,	1
but	1
the	1
nearer	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
lines	1
the	1
more	1
confident	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
our	1
troops.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
in	1
their	1
greatcoats	1
were	1
ranged	1
in	1
lines,	1
the	1
sergeants	1
major	1
and	1
company	1
officers	1
were	1
counting	1
the	1
men,	1
poking	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
in	1
each	1
section	1
in	1
the	1
ribs	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
hand	1
up.	1
Soldiers	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
were	1
dragging	1
logs	1
and	1
brushwood	1
and	1
were	1
building	1
shelters	1
with	1
merry	1
chatter	1
and	1
laughter;	1
around	1
the	1
fires	1
sat	1
others,	1
dressed	1
and	1
undressed,	1
drying	1
their	1
shirts	1
and	1
leg	1
bands	1
or	1
mending	1
boots	1
or	1
overcoats	1
and	1
crowding	1
round	1
the	1
boilers	1
and	1
porridge	1
cookers.	1
In	1
one	1
company	1
dinner	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
gazing	1
eagerly	1
at	1
the	1
steaming	1
boiler,	1
waiting	1
till	1
the	1
sample,	1
which	1
a	1
quartermaster	1
sergeant	1
was	1
carrying	1
in	1
a	1
wooden	1
bowl	1
to	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
log	1
before	1
his	1
shelter,	1
had	1
been	1
tasted.	1
	1
Another	1
company,	1
a	1
lucky	1
one	1
for	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
companies	1
had	1
vodka,	1
crowded	1
round	1
a	1
pockmarked,	1
broad-shouldered	1
sergeant	1
major	1
who,	1
tilting	1
a	1
keg,	1
filled	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
the	1
canteen	1
lids	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
lifted	1
the	1
canteen	1
lids	1
to	1
their	1
lips	1
with	1
reverential	1
faces,	1
emptied	1
them,	1
rolling	1
the	1
vodka	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sergeant	1
major	1
with	1
brightened	1
expressions,	1
licking	1
their	1
lips	1
and	1
wiping	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
their	1
greatcoats.	1
All	1
their	1
faces	1
were	1
as	1
serene	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
were	1
happening	1
at	1
home	1
awaiting	1
peaceful	1
encampment,	1
and	1
not	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
before	1
an	1
action	1
in	1
which	1
at	1
least	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
on	1
the	1
field.	1
After	1
passing	1
a	1
chasseur	1
regiment	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers--fine	1
fellows	1
busy	1
with	1
similar	1
peaceful	1
affairs--near	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
higher	1
than	1
and	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
platoon	1
of	1
grenadiers	1
before	1
whom	1
lay	1
a	1
naked	1
man.	1
Two	1
soldiers	1
held	1
him	1
while	1
two	1
others	1
were	1
flourishing	1
their	1
switches	1
and	1
striking	1
him	1
regularly	1
on	1
his	1
bare	1
back.	1
The	1
man	1
shrieked	1
unnaturally.	1
A	1
stout	1
major	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
line,	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
screams	1
kept	1
repeating:	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
soldier	1
to	1
steal;	1
a	1
soldier	1
must	1
be	1
honest,	1
honorable,	1
and	1
brave,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
robs	1
his	1
fellows	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
honor	1
in	1
him,	1
he's	1
a	1
scoundrel.	1
Go	1
on!	1
Go	1
on!"	1
	1
So	1
the	1
swishing	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
strokes,	1
and	1
the	1
desperate	1
but	1
unnatural	1
screams,	1
continued.	1
	1
"Go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
said	1
the	1
major.	1
	1
A	1
young	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bewildered	1
and	1
pained	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
stepped	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
inquiringly	1
at	1
the	1
adjutant	1
as	1
he	1
rode	1
by.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
rode	1
along	1
it.	1
Our	1
front	1
line	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
were	1
far	1
apart	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
flanks,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
center	1
where	1
the	1
men	1
with	1
a	1
flag	1
of	1
truce	1
had	1
passed	1
that	1
morning,	1
the	1
lines	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
together	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
could	1
see	1
one	1
another's	1
faces	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
Besides	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
formed	1
the	1
picket	1
line	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
curious	1
onlookers	1
who,	1
jesting	1
and	1
laughing,	1
stared	1
at	1
their	1
strange	1
foreign	1
enemies.	1
	1
Since	1
early	1
morning--despite	1
an	1
injunction	1
not	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
picket	1
line--the	1
officers	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
sight-seers	1
away.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
forming	1
the	1
picket	1
line,	1
like	1
showmen	1
exhibiting	1
a	1
curiosity,	1
no	1
longer	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
but	1
paid	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
sight-seers	1
and	1
grew	1
weary	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
relieved.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
halted	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"Look!	1
Look	1
there!"	1
one	1
soldier	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
another,	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
Russian	1
musketeer	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
picket	1
line	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
was	1
rapidly	1
and	1
excitedly	1
talking	1
to	1
a	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
"Hark	1
to	1
him	1
jabbering!	1
Fine,	1
isn't	1
it?	1
It's	1
all	1
the	1
Frenchy	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
him.	1
There	1
now,	1
Sidorov!"	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
listen.	1
It's	1
fine!"	1
answered	1
Sidorov,	1
who	1
was	1
considered	1
an	1
adept	1
at	1
French.	1
	1
The	1
soldier	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
laughers	1
referred	1
was	1
Dolokhov.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
recognized	1
him	1
and	1
stopped	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
where	1
their	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
with	1
his	1
captain.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
go	1
on,	1
go	1
on!"	1
incited	1
the	1
officer,	1
bending	1
forward	1
and	1
trying	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
speech	1
which	1
was	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
him.	1
"More,	1
please:	1
more!	1
What's	1
he	1
saying?"	1
	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
captain;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
a	1
hot	1
dispute	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
They	1
were	1
naturally	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
campaign.	1
The	1
Frenchman,	1
confusing	1
the	1
Austrians	1
with	1
the	1
Russians,	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
surrendered	1
and	1
had	1
fled	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
Ulm,	1
while	1
Dolokhov	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
Russians	1
had	1
not	1
surrendered	1
but	1
had	1
beaten	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"We	1
have	1
orders	1
to	1
drive	1
you	1
off	1
here,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
drive	1
you	1
off,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
"Only	1
take	1
care	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
Cossacks	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
captured!"	1
said	1
the	1
French	1
grenadier.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
onlookers	1
and	1
listeners	1
laughed.	1
	1
"We'll	1
make	1
you	1
dance	1
as	1
we	1
did	1
under	1
Suvorov...,"	1
*	1
said	1
Dolokhov.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"On	1
vous	1
fera	1
danser."	1
	1
"Qu'	1
est-ce	1
qu'il	1
chante?"	1
*	1
asked	1
a	1
Frenchman.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"What's	1
he	1
singing	1
about?"	1
	1
"It's	1
ancient	1
history,"	1
said	1
another,	1
guessing	1
that	1
it	1
referred	1
to	1
a	1
former	1
war.	1
"The	1
Emperor	1
will	1
teach	1
your	1
Suvara	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
taught	1
the	1
others..."	1
	1
"Bonaparte..."	1
began	1
Dolokhov,	1
but	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
interrupted	1
him.	1
	1
"Not	1
Bonaparte.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
Emperor!	1
Sacre	1
nom...!"	1
cried	1
he	1
angrily.	1
	1
"The	1
devil	1
skin	1
your	1
Emperor."	1
	1
And	1
Dolokhov	1
swore	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
coarse	1
soldier's	1
Russian	1
and	1
shouldering	1
his	1
musket	1
walked	1
away.	1
	1
"Let	1
us	1
go,	1
Ivan	1
Lukich,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
captain.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
that's	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
talk	1
French,"	1
said	1
the	1
picket	1
soldiers.	1
"Now,	1
Sidorov,	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
try!"	1
	1
Sidorov,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
French,	1
winked,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
jabber	1
meaningless	1
sounds	1
very	1
fast:	1
"Kari,	1
mala,	1
tafa,	1
safi,	1
muter,	1
Kaska,"	1
he	1
said,	1
trying	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
expressive	1
intonation	1
to	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
"Ho!	1
ho!	1
ho!	1
Ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
ha!	1
Ouh!	1
ouh!"	1
came	1
peals	1
of	1
such	1
healthy	1
and	1
good-humored	1
laughter	1
from	1
the	1
soldiers	1
that	1
it	1
infected	1
the	1
French	1
involuntarily,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
left	1
to	1
do	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
unload	1
the	1
muskets,	1
explode	1
the	1
ammunition,	1
and	1
all	1
return	1
home	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
guns	1
remained	1
loaded,	1
the	1
loopholes	1
in	1
blockhouses	1
and	1
entrenchments	1
looked	1
out	1
just	1
as	1
menacingly,	1
and	1
the	1
unlimbered	1
cannon	1
confronted	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Having	1
ridden	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
line	1
from	1
right	1
flank	1
to	1
left,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
battery	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
field	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Here	1
he	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
stopped	1
beside	1
the	1
farthest	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
unlimbered	1
cannon.	1
Before	1
the	1
guns	1
an	1
artillery	1
sentry	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down;	1
he	1
stood	1
at	1
attention	1
when	1
the	1
officer	1
arrived,	1
but	1
at	1
a	1
sign	1
resumed	1
his	1
measured,	1
monotonous	1
pacing.	1
Behind	1
the	1
guns	1
were	1
their	1
limbers	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
back	1
picket	1
ropes	1
and	1
artillerymen's	1
bonfires.	1
To	1
the	1
left,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon,	1
was	1
a	1
small,	1
newly	1
constructed	1
wattle	1
shed	1
from	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
officers'	1
voices	1
in	1
eager	1
conversation.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
view	1
over	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
Russian	1
position	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
opened	1
out	1
from	1
this	1
battery.	1
Just	1
facing	1
it,	1
on	1
the	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
hill,	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
could	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
places	1
to	1
left	1
and	1
right	1
the	1
French	1
troops	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
their	1
campfires,	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
evidently	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
itself	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
hill.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
that	1
village,	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
was	1
something	1
resembling	1
a	1
battery,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
clearly	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye.	1
Our	1
right	1
flank	1
was	1
posted	1
on	1
a	1
rather	1
steep	1
incline	1
which	1
dominated	1
the	1
French	1
position.	1
Our	1
infantry	1
were	1
stationed	1
there,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
farthest	1
point	1
the	1
dragoons.	1
In	1
the	1
center,	1
where	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
stood	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
surveying	1
the	1
position,	1
was	1
the	1
easiest	1
and	1
most	1
direct	1
descent	1
and	1
ascent	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
separating	1
us	1
from	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
On	1
the	1
left	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
copse,	1
in	1
which	1
smoked	1
the	1
bonfires	1
of	1
our	1
infantry	1
who	1
were	1
felling	1
wood.	1
The	1
French	1
line	1
was	1
wider	1
than	1
ours,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
outflank	1
us	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
Behind	1
our	1
position	1
was	1
a	1
steep	1
and	1
deep	1
dip,	1
making	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
artillery	1
and	1
cavalry	1
to	1
retire.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
notebook	1
and,	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
cannon,	1
sketched	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
position.	1
He	1
made	1
some	1
notes	1
on	1
two	1
points,	1
intending	1
to	1
mention	1
them	1
to	1
Bagration.	1
His	1
idea	1
was,	1
first,	1
to	1
concentrate	1
all	1
the	1
artillery	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
and	1
secondly,	1
to	1
withdraw	1
the	1
cavalry	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
dip.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
being	1
always	1
near	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief,	1
closely	1
following	1
the	1
mass	1
movements	1
and	1
general	1
orders,	1
and	1
constantly	1
studying	1
historical	1
accounts	1
of	1
battles,	1
involuntarily	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
in	1
the	1
forthcoming	1
action	1
in	1
broad	1
outline.	1
He	1
imagined	1
only	1
important	1
possibilities:	1
"If	1
the	1
enemy	1
attacks	1
the	1
right	1
flank,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers	1
and	1
the	1
Podolsk	1
chasseurs	1
must	1
hold	1
their	1
position	1
till	1
reserves	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
come	1
up.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
dragoons	1
could	1
successfully	1
make	1
a	1
flank	1
counterattack.	1
If	1
they	1
attack	1
our	1
center	1
we,	1
having	1
the	1
center	1
battery	1
on	1
this	1
high	1
ground,	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
under	1
its	1
cover,	1
and	1
retreat	1
to	1
the	1
dip	1
by	1
echelons."	1
So	1
he	1
reasoned....	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
beside	1
the	1
gun,	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
distinctly,	1
but	1
as	1
often	1
happens	1
had	1
not	1
understood	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying.	1
Suddenly,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
shed,	1
and	1
its	1
tone	1
was	1
so	1
sincere	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
listen.	1
	1
"No,	1
friend,"	1
said	1
a	1
pleasant	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice,	1
"what	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
beyond	1
death,	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
it.	1
That's	1
so,	1
friend."	1
	1
Another,	1
a	1
younger	1
voice,	1
interrupted	1
him:	1
"Afraid	1
or	1
not,	1
you	1
can't	1
escape	1
it	1
anyhow."	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
one	1
is	1
afraid!	1
Oh,	1
you	1
clever	1
people,"	1
said	1
a	1
third	1
manly	1
voice	1
interrupting	1
them	1
both.	1
"Of	1
course	1
you	1
artillery	1
men	1
are	1
very	1
wise,	1
because	1
you	1
can	1
take	1
everything	1
along	1
with	1
you--vodka	1
and	1
snacks."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice,	1
evidently	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer,	1
laughed.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
one	1
is	1
afraid,"	1
continued	1
the	1
first	1
speaker,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
familiar	1
voice.	1
"One	1
is	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
unknown,	1
that's	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Whatever	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
soul	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
sky...	1
we	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sky	1
but	1
only	1
an	1
atmosphere."	1
	1
The	1
manly	1
voice	1
again	1
interrupted	1
the	1
artillery	1
officer.	1
	1
"Well,	1
stand	1
us	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
herb	1
vodka,	1
Tushin,"	1
it	1
said.	1
	1
"Why,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"that's	1
the	1
captain	1
who	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
sutler's	1
hut	1
without	1
his	1
boots."	1
He	1
recognized	1
the	1
agreeable,	1
philosophizing	1
voice	1
with	1
pleasure.	1
	1
"Some	1
herb	1
vodka?	1
Certainly!"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"But	1
still,	1
to	1
conceive	1
a	1
future	1
life..."	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
finish.	1
Just	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
whistle	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
faster	1
and	1
louder,	1
louder	1
and	1
faster,	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
finished	1
saying	1
what	1
was	1
necessary,	1
thudded	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
the	1
shed	1
with	1
super	1
human	1
force,	1
throwing	1
up	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
earth.	1
The	1
ground	1
seemed	1
to	1
groan	1
at	1
the	1
terrible	1
impact.	1
	1
And	1
immediately	1
Tushin,	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
pipe	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
his	1
kind,	1
intelligent	1
face	1
rather	1
pale,	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
shed	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
manly	1
voice,	1
a	1
dashing	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
hurried	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
company,	1
buttoning	1
up	1
his	1
coat	1
as	1
he	1
ran.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XVII	1
	1
Mounting	1
his	1
horse	1
again	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
lingered	1
with	1
the	1
battery,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
puff	1
from	1
the	1
gun	1
that	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
ball.	1
His	1
eyes	1
ran	1
rapidly	1
over	1
the	1
wide	1
space,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hitherto	1
motionless	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
now	1
swayed	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
was	1
a	1
battery	1
to	1
their	1
left.	1
The	1
smoke	1
above	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed.	1
Two	1
mounted	1
Frenchmen,	1
probably	1
adjutants,	1
were	1
galloping	1
up	1
the	1
hill.	1
A	1
small	1
but	1
distinctly	1
visible	1
enemy	1
column	1
was	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
hill,	1
probably	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
shot	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dispersed	1
before	1
another	1
puff	1
appeared,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
report.	1
The	1
battle	1
had	1
begun!	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
back	1
to	1
Grunth	1
to	1
find	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
cannonade	1
behind	1
him	1
growing	1
louder	1
and	1
more	1
frequent.	1
Evidently	1
our	1
guns	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reply.	1
From	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
slope,	1
where	1
the	1
parleys	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
came	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
musketry.	1
	1
Lemarrois	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
with	1
Bonaparte's	1
stern	1
letter,	1
and	1
Murat,	1
humiliated	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
expiate	1
his	1
fault,	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
moved	1
his	1
forces	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
center	1
and	1
outflank	1
both	1
the	1
Russian	1
wings,	1
hoping	1
before	1
evening	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
contemptible	1
detachment	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
"It	1
has	1
begun.	1
Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
feeling	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
"But	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
will	1
my	1
Toulon	1
present	1
itself?"	1
	1
Passing	1
between	1
the	1
companies	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
eating	1
porridge	1
and	1
drinking	1
vodka	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before,	1
he	1
saw	1
everywhere	1
the	1
same	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
soldiers	1
forming	1
ranks	1
and	1
getting	1
their	1
muskets	1
ready,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces	1
he	1
recognized	1
the	1
same	1
eagerness	1
that	1
filled	1
his	1
heart.	1
"It	1
has	1
begun!	1
Here	1
it	1
is,	1
dreadful	1
but	1
enjoyable!"	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
each	1
soldier	1
and	1
each	1
officer	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
Before	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
embankments	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
thrown	1
up,	1
he	1
saw,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
dull	1
autumn	1
evening,	1
mounted	1
men	1
coming	1
toward	1
him.	1
The	1
foremost,	1
wearing	1
a	1
Cossack	1
cloak	1
and	1
lambskin	1
cap	1
and	1
riding	1
a	1
white	1
horse,	1
was	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
stopped,	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
up;	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
recognizing	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
nodded	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
still	1
looked	1
ahead	1
while	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
The	1
feeling,	1
"It	1
has	1
begun!	1
Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
was	1
seen	1
even	1
on	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
hard	1
brown	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
half-closed,	1
dull,	1
sleepy	1
eyes.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gazed	1
with	1
anxious	1
curiosity	1
at	1
that	1
impassive	1
face	1
and	1
wished	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
what,	1
if	1
anything,	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
thinking	1
and	1
feeling	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
"Is	1
there	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
behind	1
that	1
impassive	1
face?"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
looked.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
agreement	1
with	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
and	1
was	1
reported	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
foreseen.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
with	1
his	1
rapid	1
ride,	1
spoke	1
quickly.	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
uttering	1
his	1
words	1
with	1
an	1
Oriental	1
accent,	1
spoke	1
particularly	1
slowly,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
impress	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
hurry.	1
However,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
trot	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
followed	1
with	1
the	1
suite.	1
Behind	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
the	1
prince's	1
personal	1
adjutant,	1
Zherkov,	1
an	1
orderly	1
officer,	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
on	1
duty,	1
riding	1
a	1
fine	1
bobtailed	1
horse,	1
and	1
a	1
civilian--an	1
accountant	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
permission	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity.	1
The	1
accountant,	1
a	1
stout,	1
full-	1
faced	1
man,	1
looked	1
around	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
naive	1
smile	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
presented	1
a	1
strange	1
appearance	1
among	1
the	1
hussars,	1
Cossacks,	1
and	1
adjutants,	1
in	1
his	1
camlet	1
coat,	1
as	1
he	1
jolted	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
convoy	1
officer's	1
saddle.	1
	1
"He	1
wants	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
battle,"	1
said	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
Bolkonski,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
accountant,	1
"but	1
he	1
feels	1
a	1
pain	1
in	1
the	1
pit	1
of	1
his	1
stomach	1
already."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
leave	1
off!"	1
said	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
beaming	1
but	1
rather	1
cunning	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
flattered	1
at	1
being	1
made	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
Zherkov's	1
joke,	1
and	1
purposely	1
trying	1
to	1
appear	1
stupider	1
than	1
he	1
really	1
was.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
strange,	1
mon	1
Monsieur	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer.	1
(He	1
remembered	1
that	1
in	1
French	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
addressing	1
a	1
prince,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
quite	1
right.)	1
	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
approaching	1
Tushin's	1
battery,	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
struck	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
"What's	1
that	1
that	1
has	1
fallen?"	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
a	1
naive	1
smile.	1
	1
"A	1
French	1
pancake,"	1
answered	1
Zherkov.	1
	1
"So	1
that's	1
what	1
they	1
hit	1
with?"	1
asked	1
the	1
accountant.	1
"How	1
awful!"	1
	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
swell	1
with	1
satisfaction.	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
finished	1
speaking	1
when	1
they	1
again	1
heard	1
an	1
unexpectedly	1
violent	1
whistling	1
which	1
suddenly	1
ended	1
with	1
a	1
thud	1
into	1
something	1
soft...	1
f-f-flop!	1
and	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
riding	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
their	1
right	1
and	1
behind	1
the	1
accountant,	1
crashed	1
to	1
earth	1
with	1
his	1
horse.	1
Zherkov	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
bent	1
over	1
their	1
saddles	1
and	1
turned	1
their	1
horses	1
away.	1
The	1
accountant	1
stopped,	1
facing	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
and	1
examined	1
him	1
with	1
attentive	1
curiosity.	1
The	1
Cossack	1
was	1
dead,	1
but	1
the	1
horse	1
still	1
struggled.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
screwed	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
looked	1
round,	1
and,	1
seeing	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
confusion,	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
indifference,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say,	1
"Is	1
it	1
worth	1
while	1
noticing	1
trifles?"	1
He	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
a	1
skillful	1
rider	1
and,	1
slightly	1
bending	1
over,	1
disengaged	1
his	1
saber	1
which	1
had	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
cloak.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
old-fashioned	1
saber	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
general	1
use.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
remembered	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Suvorov	1
giving	1
his	1
saber	1
to	1
Bagration	1
in	1
Italy,	1
and	1
the	1
recollection	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleasant	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
They	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
battery	1
at	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
been	1
when	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
battlefield.	1
	1
"Whose	1
company?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
of	1
an	1
artilleryman	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
ammunition	1
wagon.	1
	1
He	1
asked,	1
"Whose	1
company?"	1
but	1
he	1
really	1
meant,	1
"Are	1
you	1
frightened	1
here?"	1
and	1
the	1
artilleryman	1
understood	1
him.	1
	1
"Captain	1
Tushin's,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
red-haired,	1
freckled	1
gunner	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
voice,	1
standing	1
to	1
attention.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,"	1
muttered	1
Bagration	1
as	1
if	1
considering	1
something,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
limbers	1
to	1
the	1
farthest	1
cannon.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
approached,	1
a	1
ringing	1
shot	1
issued	1
from	1
it	1
deafening	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
smoke	1
that	1
suddenly	1
surrounded	1
the	1
gun	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
gunners	1
who	1
had	1
seized	1
it	1
straining	1
to	1
roll	1
it	1
quickly	1
back	1
to	1
its	1
former	1
position.	1
A	1
huge,	1
broad-shouldered	1
gunner,	1
Number	1
One,	1
holding	1
a	1
mop,	1
his	1
legs	1
far	1
apart,	1
sprang	1
to	1
the	1
wheel;	1
while	1
Number	1
Two	1
with	1
a	1
trembling	1
hand	1
placed	1
a	1
charge	1
in	1
the	1
cannon's	1
mouth.	1
The	1
short,	1
round-	1
shouldered	1
Captain	1
Tushin,	1
stumbling	1
over	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
the	1
gun	1
carriage,	1
moved	1
forward	1
and,	1
not	1
noticing	1
the	1
general,	1
looked	1
out	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand.	1
	1
"Lift	1
it	1
two	1
lines	1
more	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
right,"	1
cried	1
he	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
impart	1
a	1
dashing	1
note,	1
ill-suited	1
to	1
his	1
weak	1
figure.	1
"Number	1
Two!"	1
he	1
squeaked.	1
"Fire,	1
Medvedev!"	1
	1
Bagration	1
called	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Tushin,	1
raising	1
three	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
cap	1
with	1
a	1
bashful	1
and	1
awkward	1
gesture	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
a	1
military	1
salute	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
priest's	1
benediction,	1
approached	1
the	1
general.	1
Though	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
had	1
been	1
intended	1
to	1
cannonade	1
the	1
valley,	1
he	1
was	1
firing	1
incendiary	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
visible	1
just	1
opposite,	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
large	1
masses	1
of	1
French	1
were	1
advancing.	1
	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
given	1
Tushin	1
orders	1
where	1
and	1
at	1
what	1
to	1
fire,	1
but	1
after	1
consulting	1
his	1
sergeant	1
major,	1
Zakharchenko,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
respect,	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
village.	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
officer's	1
report,	1
and	1
began	1
deliberately	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
whole	1
battlefield	1
extended	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
advanced	1
nearest	1
on	1
our	1
right.	1
Below	1
the	1
height	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Kiev	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
where	1
the	1
rivulet	1
flowed,	1
the	1
soul-stirring	1
rolling	1
and	1
crackling	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
much	1
farther	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
beyond	1
the	1
dragoons,	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
Bagration	1
a	1
French	1
column	1
that	1
was	1
outflanking	1
us.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
the	1
horizon	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
adjacent	1
wood.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
ordered	1
two	1
battalions	1
from	1
the	1
center	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
reinforce	1
the	1
right	1
flank.	1
The	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
ventured	1
to	1
remark	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
battalions	1
went	1
away,	1
the	1
guns	1
would	1
remain	1
without	1
support.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
dull	1
eyes	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
silence.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
that	1
the	1
officer's	1
remark	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
that	1
really	1
no	1
answer	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
an	1
adjutant	1
galloped	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
news	1
that	1
immense	1
masses	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
in	1
disorder	1
and	1
was	1
retreating	1
upon	1
the	1
Kiev	1
grenadiers.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
sign	1
of	1
assent	1
and	1
approval.	1
He	1
rode	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
sent	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
the	1
dragoons	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French.	1
But	1
this	1
adjutant	1
returned	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
dragoons	1
had	1
already	1
retreated	1
beyond	1
the	1
dip	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
a	1
heavy	1
fire	1
had	1
been	1
opened	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
losing	1
men	1
uselessly,	1
and	1
so	1
had	1
hastened	1
to	1
throw	1
some	1
sharpshooters	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
	1
"Very	1
good!"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
the	1
battery,	1
firing	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
also,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
himself,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
sent	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
(the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
paraded	1
his	1
regiment	1
before	1
Kutuzov	1
at	1
Braunau)	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
retreat	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
behind	1
the	1
hollow	1
in	1
the	1
rear,	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
enemy's	1
attack	1
very	1
long.	1
About	1
Tushin	1
and	1
the	1
battalion	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
battery	1
all	1
was	1
forgotten.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
Bagration's	1
colloquies	1
with	1
the	1
commanding	1
officers	1
and	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
surprise,	1
found	1
that	1
no	1
orders	1
were	1
really	1
given,	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
appear	1
that	1
everything	1
done	1
by	1
necessity,	1
by	1
accident,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
subordinate	1
commanders	1
was	1
done,	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
direct	1
command,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
his	1
intentions.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
noticed,	1
however,	1
that	1
though	1
what	1
happened	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
chance	1
and	1
was	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
commander's	1
will,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
tact	1
Bagration	1
showed,	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
very	1
valuable.	1
Officers	1
who	1
approached	1
him	1
with	1
disturbed	1
countenances	1
became	1
calm;	1
soldiers	1
and	1
officers	1
greeted	1
him	1
gaily,	1
grew	1
more	1
cheerful	1
in	1
his	1
presence,	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
anxious	1
to	1
display	1
their	1
courage	1
before	1
him.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVIII	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
highest	1
point	1
of	1
our	1
right	1
flank,	1
began	1
riding	1
downhill	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
musketry	1
was	1
heard	1
but	1
where	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
smoke	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
nearer	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
the	1
less	1
they	1
could	1
see	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
they	1
felt	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
actual	1
battlefield.	1
They	1
began	1
to	1
meet	1
wounded	1
men.	1
One	1
with	1
a	1
bleeding	1
head	1
and	1
no	1
cap	1
was	1
being	1
dragged	1
along	1
by	1
two	1
soldiers	1
who	1
supported	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
arms.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
gurgle	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
spitting	1
blood.	1
A	1
bullet	1
had	1
evidently	1
hit	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
throat	1
or	1
mouth.	1
Another	1
was	1
walking	1
sturdily	1
by	1
himself	1
but	1
without	1
his	1
musket,	1
groaning	1
aloud	1
and	1
swinging	1
his	1
arm	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
hurt,	1
while	1
blood	1
from	1
it	1
was	1
streaming	1
over	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
bottle.	1
He	1
had	1
that	1
moment	1
been	1
wounded	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
showed	1
fear	1
rather	1
than	1
suffering.	1
Crossing	1
a	1
road	1
they	1
descended	1
a	1
steep	1
incline	1
and	1
saw	1
several	1
men	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
ground;	1
they	1
also	1
met	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
unwounded.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
were	1
ascending	1
the	1
hill	1
breathing	1
heavily,	1
and	1
despite	1
the	1
general's	1
presence	1
were	1
talking	1
loudly	1
and	1
gesticulating.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
rows	1
of	1
gray	1
cloaks	1
were	1
already	1
visible	1
through	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
an	1
officer	1
catching	1
sight	1
of	1
Bagration	1
rushed	1
shouting	1
after	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
retreating	1
soldiers,	1
ordering	1
them	1
back.	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
along	1
which	1
shots	1
crackled	1
now	1
here	1
and	1
now	1
there,	1
drowning	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices	1
and	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
command.	1
The	1
whole	1
air	1
reeked	1
with	1
smoke.	1
The	1
excited	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
were	1
blackened	1
with	1
it.	1
Some	1
were	1
using	1
their	1
ramrods,	1
others	1
putting	1
powder	1
on	1
the	1
touchpans	1
or	1
taking	1
charges	1
from	1
their	1
pouches,	1
while	1
others	1
were	1
firing,	1
though	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
for	1
the	1
smoke	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
wind	1
to	1
carry	1
away.	1
A	1
pleasant	1
humming	1
and	1
whistling	1
of	1
bullets	1
were	1
often	1
heard.	1
"What	1
is	1
this?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
approaching	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
"It	1
can't	1
be	1
an	1
attack,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
moving;	1
it	1
can't	1
be	1
a	1
square--for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
drawn	1
up	1
for	1
that."	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
a	1
thin,	1
feeble-looking	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile--his	1
eyelids	1
drooping	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
over	1
his	1
old	1
eyes,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
mild	1
expression,	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Bagration	1
and	1
welcomed	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
host	1
welcomes	1
an	1
honored	1
guest.	1
He	1
reported	1
that	1
his	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
attacked	1
by	1
French	1
cavalry	1
and	1
that,	1
though	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
his	1
men.	1
He	1
said	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed,	1
employing	1
this	1
military	1
term	1
to	1
describe	1
what	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
regiment,	1
but	1
in	1
reality	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
during	1
that	1
half-hour	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
entrusted	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
with	1
certainty	1
whether	1
the	1
attack	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed	1
or	1
his	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
up.	1
All	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
balls	1
and	1
shells	1
began	1
flying	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
regiment	1
and	1
hitting	1
men	1
and	1
that	1
afterwards	1
someone	1
had	1
shouted	1
"Cavalry!"	1
and	1
our	1
men	1
had	1
begun	1
firing.	1
They	1
were	1
still	1
firing,	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
cavalry	1
which	1
had	1
disappeared,	1
but	1
at	1
French	1
infantry	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hollow	1
and	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
our	1
men.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
desired	1
and	1
expected.	1
Turning	1
to	1
his	1
adjutant	1
he	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
passed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
changed	1
expression	1
on	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
face	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
It	1
expressed	1
the	1
concentrated	1
and	1
happy	1
resolution	1
you	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
on	1
a	1
hot	1
day	1
takes	1
a	1
final	1
run	1
before	1
plunging	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
dull,	1
sleepy	1
expression	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
there,	1
nor	1
the	1
affectation	1
of	1
profound	1
thought.	1
The	1
round,	1
steady,	1
hawk's	1
eyes	1
looked	1
before	1
him	1
eagerly	1
and	1
rather	1
disdainfully,	1
not	1
resting	1
on	1
anything	1
although	1
his	1
movements	1
were	1
still	1
slow	1
and	1
measured.	1
	1
The	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
turned	1
to	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
dangerous	1
to	1
remain	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1
"Please,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
glancing	1
for	1
support	1
at	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
suite	1
who	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
"There,	1
you	1
see!"	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
bullets	1
whistling,	1
singing,	1
and	1
hissing	1
continually	1
around	1
them.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
entreaty	1
and	1
reproach	1
that	1
a	1
carpenter	1
uses	1
to	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
has	1
picked	1
up	1
an	1
ax:	1
"We	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
you,	1
sir,	1
will	1
blister	1
your	1
hands."	1
He	1
spoke	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
bullets	1
could	1
not	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
gave	1
still	1
more	1
persuasiveness	1
to	1
his	1
words.	1
The	1
staff	1
officer	1
joined	1
in	1
the	1
colonel's	1
appeals,	1
but	1
Bagration	1
did	1
not	1
reply;	1
he	1
only	1
gave	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
cease	1
firing	1
and	1
re-form,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
approaching	1
battalions.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
speaking,	1
the	1
curtain	1
of	1
smoke	1
that	1
had	1
concealed	1
the	1
hollow,	1
driven	1
by	1
a	1
rising	1
wind,	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
from	1
right	1
to	1
left	1
as	1
if	1
drawn	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
hill	1
opposite,	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
moving	1
about	1
on	1
it,	1
opened	1
out	1
before	1
them.	1
All	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
involuntarily	1
on	1
this	1
French	1
column	1
advancing	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
winding	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
uneven	1
ground.	1
One	1
could	1
already	1
see	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
shaggy	1
caps,	1
distinguish	1
the	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
standard	1
flapping	1
against	1
its	1
staff.	1
	1
"They	1
march	1
splendidly,"	1
remarked	1
someone	1
in	1
Bagration's	1
suite.	1
	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
had	1
already	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
hollow.	1
The	1
clash	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
it...	1
	1
The	1
remains	1
of	1
our	1
regiment	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
action	1
rapidly	1
formed	1
up	1
and	1
moved	1
to	1
the	1
right;	1
from	1
behind	1
it,	1
dispersing	1
the	1
laggards,	1
came	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
in	1
fine	1
order.	1
Before	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
Bagration,	1
the	1
weighty	1
tread	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
marching	1
in	1
step	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
On	1
their	1
left	1
flank,	1
nearest	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
marched	1
a	1
company	1
commander,	1
a	1
fine	1
round-faced	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
stupid	1
and	1
happy	1
expression--the	1
same	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wattle	1
shed.	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
clearly	1
thinking	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
how	1
dashing	1
a	1
fellow	1
he	1
would	1
appear	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
the	1
commander.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
self-satisfaction	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
parade,	1
he	1
stepped	1
lightly	1
with	1
his	1
muscular	1
legs	1
as	1
if	1
sailing	1
along,	1
stretching	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
height	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
effort,	1
his	1
ease	1
contrasting	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
tread	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
keeping	1
step	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
carried	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
leg	1
a	1
narrow	1
unsheathed	1
sword	1
(small,	1
curved,	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
real	1
weapon)	1
and	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
superior	1
officers	1
and	1
now	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
without	1
losing	1
step,	1
his	1
whole	1
powerful	1
body	1
turning	1
flexibly.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
were	1
concentrated	1
on	1
passing	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
manner,	1
and	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
it	1
well	1
he	1
was	1
happy.	1
"Left...	1
left...	1
left..."	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
each	1
alternate	1
step;	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
this,	1
with	1
stern	1
but	1
varied	1
faces,	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
soldiers	1
burdened	1
with	1
knapsacks	1
and	1
muskets	1
marched	1
in	1
step,	1
and	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
hundreds	1
of	1
soldiers	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
each	1
alternate	1
step,	1
"Left...	1
left...	1
left..."	1
A	1
fat	1
major	1
skirted	1
a	1
bush,	1
puffing	1
and	1
falling	1
out	1
of	1
step;	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
his	1
face	1
showing	1
alarm	1
at	1
his	1
defection,	1
ran	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
panting	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
company.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
cleaving	1
the	1
air,	1
flew	1
over	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
Bagration	1
and	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
column	1
to	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
"Left...	1
left!"	1
"Close	1
up!"	1
came	1
the	1
company	1
commander's	1
voice	1
in	1
jaunty	1
tones.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
passed	1
in	1
a	1
semicircle	1
round	1
something	1
where	1
the	1
ball	1
had	1
fallen,	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
trooper	1
on	1
the	1
flank,	1
a	1
noncommissioned	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
stopped	1
beside	1
the	1
dead	1
men,	1
ran	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
his	1
line	1
and,	1
falling	1
into	1
step	1
with	1
a	1
hop,	1
looked	1
back	1
angrily,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
ominous	1
silence	1
and	1
the	1
regular	1
tramp	1
of	1
feet	1
beating	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
unison,	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
left...	1
left...	1
left.	1
	1
"Well	1
done,	1
lads!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bagration.	1
	1
"Glad	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
best,	1
your	1
ex'len-lency!"	1
came	1
a	1
confused	1
shout	1
from	1
the	1
ranks.	1
A	1
morose	1
soldier	1
marching	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bagration	1
as	1
he	1
shouted,	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"We	1
know	1
that	1
ourselves!"	1
Another,	1
without	1
looking	1
round,	1
as	1
though	1
fearing	1
to	1
relax,	1
shouted	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
wide	1
open	1
and	1
passed	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
order	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
halt	1
and	1
down	1
knapsacks.	1
	1
Bagration	1
rode	1
round	1
the	1
ranks	1
that	1
had	1
marched	1
past	1
him	1
and	1
dismounted.	1
He	1
gave	1
the	1
reins	1
to	1
a	1
Cossack,	1
took	1
off	1
and	1
handed	1
over	1
his	1
felt	1
coat,	1
stretched	1
his	1
legs,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
cap	1
straight.	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
column,	1
with	1
its	1
officers	1
leading,	1
appeared	1
from	1
below	1
the	1
hill.	1
	1
"Forward,	1
with	1
God!"	1
said	1
Bagration,	1
in	1
a	1
resolute,	1
sonorous	1
voice,	1
turning	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
and	1
slightly	1
swinging	1
his	1
arms,	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
uneasily	1
over	1
the	1
rough	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
awkward	1
gait	1
of	1
a	1
cavalryman.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
felt	1
that	1
an	1
invisible	1
power	1
was	1
leading	1
him	1
forward,	1
and	1
experienced	1
great	1
happiness.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
near.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
walking	1
beside	1
Bagration,	1
could	1
clearly	1
distinguish	1
their	1
bandoliers,	1
red	1
epaulets,	1
and	1
even	1
their	1
faces.	1
(He	1
distinctly	1
saw	1
an	1
old	1
French	1
officer	1
who,	1
with	1
gaitered	1
legs	1
and	1
turned-out	1
toes,	1
climbed	1
the	1
hill	1
with	1
difficulty.)	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
gave	1
no	1
further	1
orders	1
and	1
silently	1
continued	1
to	1
walk	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
ranks.	1
Suddenly	1
one	1
shot	1
after	1
another	1
rang	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
smoke	1
appeared	1
all	1
along	1
their	1
uneven	1
ranks,	1
and	1
musket	1
shots	1
sounded.	1
Several	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
fell,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
round-faced	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
marched	1
so	1
gaily	1
and	1
complacently.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
first	1
report	1
was	1
heard,	1
Bagration	1
looked	1
round	1
and	1
shouted,	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Hurrah--ah!--ah!"	1
rang	1
a	1
long-drawn	1
shout	1
from	1
our	1
ranks,	1
and	1
passing	1
Bagration	1
and	1
racing	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
rushed	1
in	1
an	1
irregular	1
but	1
joyous	1
and	1
eager	1
crowd	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
their	1
disordered	1
foe.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX	1
	1
The	1
attack	1
of	1
the	1
Sixth	1
Chasseurs	1
secured	1
the	1
retreat	1
of	1
our	1
right	1
flank.	1
In	1
the	1
center	1
Tushin's	1
forgotten	1
battery,	1
which	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
village,	1
delayed	1
the	1
French	1
advance.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
putting	1
out	1
the	1
fire	1
which	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
spreading,	1
and	1
thus	1
gave	1
us	1
time	1
to	1
retreat.	1
The	1
retirement	1
of	1
the	1
center	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
dip	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
was	1
hurried	1
and	1
noisy,	1
but	1
the	1
different	1
companies	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
mixed.	1
But	1
our	1
left--which	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
Azov	1
and	1
Podolsk	1
infantry	1
and	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars--was	1
simultaneously	1
attacked	1
and	1
outflanked	1
by	1
superior	1
French	1
forces	1
under	1
Lannes	1
and	1
was	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion.	1
Bagration	1
had	1
sent	1
Zherkov	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
commanding	1
that	1
left	1
flank	1
with	1
orders	1
to	1
retreat	1
immediately.	1
	1
Zherkov,	1
not	1
removing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
his	1
cap,	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
about	1
and	1
galloped	1
off.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
Bagration	1
than	1
his	1
courage	1
failed	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
panic	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
dangerous.	1
	1
Having	1
reached	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
where	1
the	1
firing	1
was,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
his	1
staff	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
be,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
deliver	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
The	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
belonged	1
by	1
seniority	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
reviewed	1
at	1
Braunau	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
Dolokhov	1
was	1
serving	1
as	1
a	1
private.	1
But	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
left	1
flank	1
had	1
been	1
assigned	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving,	1
and	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
arose.	1
The	1
two	1
commanders	1
were	1
much	1
exasperated	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
and,	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
action	1
had	1
begun	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
already	1
advancing,	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
discussion	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
offending	1
one	1
another.	1
But	1
the	1
regiments,	1
both	1
cavalry	1
and	1
infantry,	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
impending	1
action.	1
From	1
privates	1
to	1
general	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
expecting	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
peaceful	1
occupations,	1
the	1
cavalry	1
feeding	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
infantry	1
collecting	1
wood.	1
	1
"He	1
higher	1
iss	1
dan	1
I	1
in	1
rank,"	1
said	1
the	1
German	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
hussars,	1
flushing	1
and	1
addressing	1
an	1
adjutant	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
up,	1
"so	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
vill,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
sacrifice	1
my	1
hussars...	1
Bugler,	1
sount	1
ze	1
retreat!"	1
	1
But	1
haste	1
was	1
becoming	1
imperative.	1
Cannon	1
and	1
musketry,	1
mingling	1
together,	1
thundered	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
while	1
the	1
capotes	1
of	1
Lannes'	1
sharpshooters	1
were	1
already	1
seen	1
crossing	1
the	1
milldam	1
and	1
forming	1
up	1
within	1
twice	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
a	1
musket	1
shot.	1
The	1
general	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
infantry	1
went	1
toward	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
jerky	1
steps,	1
and	1
having	1
mounted	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
very	1
straight	1
and	1
tall	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
commander.	1
The	1
commanders	1
met	1
with	1
polite	1
bows	1
but	1
with	1
secret	1
malevolence	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
"Once	1
again,	1
Colonel,"	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
"I	1
can't	1
leave	1
half	1
my	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
"to	1
occupy	1
the	1
position	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
an	1
attack."	1
	1
"I	1
peg	1
of	1
you	1
yourself	1
not	1
to	1
mix	1
in	1
vot	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
business!"	1
suddenly	1
replied	1
the	1
irate	1
colonel.	1
"If	1
you	1
vere	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry..."	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
cavalry,	1
Colonel,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Russian	1
general	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact..."	1
	1
"Quite	1
avare,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
suddenly	1
shouted	1
the	1
colonel,	1
touching	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
turning	1
purple	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
"Vill	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
goot	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
ze	1
front	1
and	1
see	1
dat	1
zis	1
position	1
iss	1
no	1
goot?	1
I	1
don't	1
vish	1
to	1
destroy	1
my	1
men	1
for	1
your	1
pleasure!"	1
	1
"You	1
forget	1
yourself,	1
Colonel.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
considering	1
my	1
own	1
pleasure	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
allow	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
said!"	1
	1
Taking	1
the	1
colonel's	1
outburst	1
as	1
a	1
challenge	1
to	1
his	1
courage,	1
the	1
general	1
expanded	1
his	1
chest	1
and	1
rode,	1
frowning,	1
beside	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
line,	1
as	1
if	1
their	1
differences	1
would	1
be	1
settled	1
there	1
amongst	1
the	1
bullets.	1
They	1
reached	1
the	1
front,	1
several	1
bullets	1
sped	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
halted	1
in	1
silence.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
fresh	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
line,	1
for	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
cavalry	1
to	1
act	1
among	1
the	1
bushes	1
and	1
broken	1
ground,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
were	1
outflanking	1
our	1
left.	1
The	1
general	1
and	1
colonel	1
looked	1
sternly	1
and	1
significantly	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
like	1
two	1
fighting	1
cocks	1
preparing	1
for	1
battle,	1
each	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
detect	1
signs	1
of	1
cowardice	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Both	1
passed	1
the	1
examination	1
successfully.	1
As	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
said,	1
and	1
neither	1
wished	1
to	1
give	1
occasion	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
alleged	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
fire,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
there	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
testing	1
each	1
other's	1
courage	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
just	1
then	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
and	1
a	1
muffled	1
shout	1
almost	1
behind	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
men	1
collecting	1
wood	1
in	1
the	1
copse.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
hussars	1
to	1
retreat	1
with	1
the	1
infantry.	1
They	1
were	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
retreat	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
French.	1
However	1
inconvenient	1
the	1
position,	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
necessary	1
to	1
attack	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
cut	1
a	1
way	1
through	1
for	1
themselves.	1
	1
The	1
squadron	1
in	1
which	1
Rostov	1
was	1
serving	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
mount	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
halted	1
facing	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Again,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
Enns	1
bridge,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
between	1
the	1
squadron	1
and	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
again	1
that	1
terrible	1
dividing	1
line	1
of	1
uncertainty	1
and	1
fear--resembling	1
the	1
line	1
separating	1
the	1
living	1
from	1
the	1
dead--lay	1
between	1
them.	1
All	1
were	1
conscious	1
of	1
this	1
unseen	1
line,	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
would	1
cross	1
it,	1
agitated	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
The	1
colonel	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
angrily	1
gave	1
some	1
reply	1
to	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
officers,	1
and,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
desperately	1
insisting	1
on	1
having	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
gave	1
an	1
order.	1
No	1
one	1
said	1
anything	1
definite,	1
but	1
the	1
rumor	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
squadron.	1
The	1
command	1
to	1
form	1
up	1
rang	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
sabers	1
whizzed	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
drawn	1
from	1
their	1
scabbards.	1
Still	1
no	1
one	1
moved.	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
flank,	1
infantry	1
and	1
hussars	1
alike,	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
commander	1
did	1
not	1
himself	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
this	1
irresolution	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
men.	1
	1
"If	1
only	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
quick!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
feeling	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
experience	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
an	1
attack	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
often	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
fellow	1
hussars.	1
	1
"Fo'ward,	1
with	1
God,	1
lads!"	1
rang	1
out	1
Denisov's	1
voice.	1
"At	1
a	1
twot	1
fo'ward!"	1
	1
The	1
horses'	1
croups	1
began	1
to	1
sway	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
line.	1
Rook	1
pulled	1
at	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
started	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord.	1
	1
Before	1
him,	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
front	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
hussars	1
and	1
still	1
farther	1
ahead	1
a	1
dark	1
line	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
distinctly	1
but	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
enemy.	1
Shots	1
could	1
be	1
heard,	1
but	1
some	1
way	1
off.	1
	1
"Faster!"	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
command,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
Rook's	1
flanks	1
drooping	1
as	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
gallop.	1
	1
Rostov	1
anticipated	1
his	1
horse's	1
movements	1
and	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated.	1
He	1
had	1
noticed	1
a	1
solitary	1
tree	1
ahead	1
of	1
him.	1
This	1
tree	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
seemed	1
so	1
terrible--and	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
crossed	1
that	1
line	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
there	1
nothing	1
terrible,	1
but	1
everything	1
was	1
becoming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
happy	1
and	1
animated.	1
"Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
will	1
slash	1
at	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
gripping	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
saber.	1
	1
"Hur-a-a-a-ah!"	1
came	1
a	1
roar	1
of	1
voices.	1
"Let	1
anyone	1
come	1
my	1
way	1
now,"	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
driving	1
his	1
spurs	1
into	1
Rook	1
and	1
letting	1
him	1
go	1
at	1
a	1
full	1
gallop	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
outstripped	1
the	1
others.	1
Ahead,	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
already	1
visible.	1
Suddenly	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
birch	1
broom	1
seemed	1
to	1
sweep	1
over	1
the	1
squadron.	1
Rostov	1
raised	1
his	1
saber,	1
ready	1
to	1
strike,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
trooper	1
Nikitenko,	1
who	1
was	1
galloping	1
ahead,	1
shot	1
away	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
forward	1
with	1
unnatural	1
speed	1
but	1
yet	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
spot.	1
From	1
behind	1
him	1
Bondarchuk,	1
an	1
hussar	1
he	1
knew,	1
jolted	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
angrily	1
at	1
him.	1
Bondarchuk's	1
horse	1
swerved	1
and	1
galloped	1
past.	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
moving?	1
I	1
have	1
fallen,	1
I	1
am	1
killed!"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
and	1
answered	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field.	1
Instead	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
horses	1
and	1
hussars'	1
backs,	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
before	1
him	1
but	1
the	1
motionless	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
stubble	1
around	1
him.	1
There	1
was	1
warm	1
blood	1
under	1
his	1
arm.	1
"No,	1
I	1
am	1
wounded	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
is	1
killed."	1
Rook	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
his	1
forelegs	1
but	1
fell	1
back,	1
pinning	1
his	1
rider's	1
leg.	1
Blood	1
was	1
flowing	1
from	1
his	1
head;	1
he	1
struggled	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
rise.	1
Rostov	1
also	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
but	1
fell	1
back,	1
his	1
sabretache	1
having	1
become	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
saddle.	1
Where	1
our	1
men	1
were,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
near.	1
	1
Having	1
disentangled	1
his	1
leg,	1
he	1
rose.	1
"Where,	1
on	1
which	1
side,	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
had	1
so	1
sharply	1
divided	1
the	1
two	1
armies?"	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
answer.	1
"Can	1
something	1
bad	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
me?"	1
he	1
wondered	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
superfluous	1
was	1
hanging	1
on	1
his	1
benumbed	1
left	1
arm.	1
The	1
wrist	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
his.	1
He	1
examined	1
his	1
hand	1
carefully,	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
blood	1
on	1
it.	1
"Ah,	1
here	1
are	1
people	1
coming,"	1
he	1
thought	1
joyfully,	1
seeing	1
some	1
men	1
running	1
toward	1
him.	1
"They	1
will	1
help	1
me!"	1
In	1
front	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
wearing	1
a	1
strange	1
shako	1
and	1
a	1
blue	1
cloak,	1
swarthy,	1
sunburned,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
hooked	1
nose.	1
Then	1
came	1
two	1
more,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
running	1
behind.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
something	1
strange,	1
not	1
in	1
Russian.	1
In	1
among	1
the	1
hindmost	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
wearing	1
similar	1
shakos	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
hussar.	1
He	1
was	1
being	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
horse	1
was	1
being	1
led	1
behind	1
him.	1
	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
ours,	1
a	1
prisoner.	1
Yes.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
too?	1
Who	1
are	1
these	1
men?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
scarcely	1
believing	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Can	1
they	1
be	1
French?"	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
approaching	1
Frenchmen,	1
and	1
though	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
galloping	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
them	1
and	1
hack	1
them	1
to	1
pieces,	1
their	1
proximity	1
now	1
seemed	1
so	1
awful	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
his	1
eyes.	1
"Who	1
are	1
they?	1
Why	1
are	1
they	1
running?	1
Can	1
they	1
be	1
coming	1
at	1
me?	1
And	1
why?	1
To	1
kill	1
me?	1
Me	1
whom	1
everyone	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of?"	1
He	1
remembered	1
his	1
mother's	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
family's,	1
and	1
his	1
friends',	1
and	1
the	1
enemy's	1
intention	1
to	1
kill	1
him	1
seemed	1
impossible.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
it!"	1
For	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
seconds	1
he	1
stood	1
not	1
moving	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
or	1
realizing	1
the	1
situation.	1
The	1
foremost	1
Frenchman,	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
hooked	1
nose,	1
was	1
already	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
And	1
the	1
excited,	1
alien	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
man,	1
his	1
bayonet	1
hanging	1
down,	1
holding	1
his	1
breath,	1
and	1
running	1
so	1
lightly,	1
frightened	1
Rostov.	1
He	1
seized	1
his	1
pistol	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
firing	1
it,	1
flung	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
toward	1
the	1
bushes.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
run	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
doubt	1
and	1
conflict	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
trodden	1
the	1
Enns	1
bridge,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
a	1
hare	1
fleeing	1
from	1
the	1
hounds.	1
One	1
single	1
sentiment,	1
that	1
of	1
fear	1
for	1
his	1
young	1
and	1
happy	1
life,	1
possessed	1
his	1
whole	1
being.	1
Rapidly	1
leaping	1
the	1
furrows,	1
he	1
fled	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
impetuosity	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
show	1
at	1
catchplay,	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
his	1
good-natured,	1
pale,	1
young	1
face	1
to	1
look	1
back.	1
A	1
shudder	1
of	1
terror	1
went	1
through	1
him:	1
"No,	1
better	1
not	1
look,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
but	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
bushes	1
he	1
glanced	1
round	1
once	1
more.	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
fallen	1
behind,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
changed	1
his	1
run	1
to	1
a	1
walk	1
and,	1
turning,	1
shouted	1
something	1
loudly	1
to	1
a	1
comrade	1
farther	1
back.	1
Rostov	1
paused.	1
"No,	1
there's	1
some	1
mistake,"	1
thought	1
he.	1
"They	1
can't	1
have	1
wanted	1
to	1
kill	1
me."	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
felt	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
seventy-pound	1
weight	1
were	1
tied	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
run	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
also	1
stopped	1
and	1
took	1
aim.	1
Rostov	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
stooped	1
down.	1
One	1
bullet	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
whistled	1
past	1
him.	1
He	1
mustered	1
his	1
last	1
remaining	1
strength,	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
bushes.	1
Behind	1
these	1
were	1
some	1
Russian	1
sharpshooters.	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
XX	1
	1
The	1
infantry	1
regiments	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
unawares	1
in	1
the	1
outskirts	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
different	1
companies	1
getting	1
mixed,	1
and	1
retreated	1
as	1
a	1
disorderly	1
crowd.	1
One	1
soldier,	1
in	1
his	1
fear,	1
uttered	1
the	1
senseless	1
cry,	1
"Cut	1
off!"	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
terrible	1
in	1
battle,	1
and	1
that	1
word	1
infected	1
the	1
whole	1
crowd	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
panic.	1
	1
"Surrounded!	1
Cut	1
off?	1
We're	1
lost!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
fugitives.	1
	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
firing	1
and	1
the	1
cry	1
from	1
behind,	1
the	1
general	1
realized	1
that	1
something	1
dreadful	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
his	1
regiment,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he,	1
an	1
exemplary	1
officer	1
of	1
many	1
years'	1
service	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
to	1
blame,	1
might	1
be	1
held	1
responsible	1
at	1
headquarters	1
for	1
negligence	1
or	1
inefficiency	1
so	1
staggered	1
him	1
that,	1
forgetting	1
the	1
recalcitrant	1
cavalry	1
colonel,	1
his	1
own	1
dignity	1
as	1
a	1
general,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
the	1
danger	1
and	1
all	1
regard	1
for	1
self-preservation,	1
he	1
clutched	1
the	1
crupper	1
of	1
his	1
saddle	1
and,	1
spurring	1
his	1
horse,	1
galloped	1
to	1
the	1
regiment	1
under	1
a	1
hail	1
of	1
bullets	1
which	1
fell	1
around,	1
but	1
fortunately	1
missed	1
him.	1
His	1
one	1
desire	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
and	1
at	1
any	1
cost	1
correct,	1
or	1
remedy,	1
the	1
mistake	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
one,	1
so	1
that	1
he,	1
an	1
exemplary	1
officer	1
of	1
twenty-two	1
years'	1
service,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
censured,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
held	1
to	1
blame.	1
	1
Having	1
galloped	1
safely	1
through	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
reached	1
a	1
field	1
behind	1
the	1
copse	1
across	1
which	1
our	1
men,	1
regardless	1
of	1
orders,	1
were	1
running	1
and	1
descending	1
the	1
valley.	1
That	1
moment	1
of	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decides	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
battles	1
had	1
arrived.	1
Would	1
this	1
disorderly	1
crowd	1
of	1
soldiers	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
their	1
commander,	1
or	1
would	1
they,	1
disregarding	1
him,	1
continue	1
their	1
flight?	1
Despite	1
his	1
desperate	1
shouts	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
seem	1
so	1
terrible	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
despite	1
his	1
furious	1
purple	1
countenance	1
distorted	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
likeness	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
self,	1
and	1
the	1
flourishing	1
of	1
his	1
saber,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
all	1
continued	1
to	1
run,	1
talking,	1
firing	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
disobeying	1
orders.	1
The	1
moral	1
hesitation	1
which	1
decided	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
battles	1
was	1
evidently	1
culminating	1
in	1
a	1
panic.	1
	1
The	1
general	1
had	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
coughing	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
shouting	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke	1
and	1
stopped	1
in	1
despair.	1
Everything	1
seemed	1
lost.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
were	1
attacking,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
reason,	1
ran	1
back	1
and	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
outskirts,	1
and	1
Russian	1
sharpshooters	1
showed	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
copse.	1
It	1
was	1
Timokhin's	1
company,	1
which	1
alone	1
had	1
maintained	1
its	1
order	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
and,	1
having	1
lain	1
in	1
ambush	1
in	1
a	1
ditch,	1
now	1
attacked	1
the	1
French	1
unexpectedly.	1
Timokhin,	1
armed	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
sword,	1
had	1
rushed	1
at	1
the	1
enemy	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
desperate	1
cry	1
and	1
such	1
mad,	1
drunken	1
determination	1
that,	1
taken	1
by	1
surprise,	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
thrown	1
down	1
their	1
muskets	1
and	1
run.	1
Dolokhov,	1
running	1
beside	1
Timokhin,	1
killed	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
and	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
surrendering	1
French	1
officer	1
by	1
his	1
collar.	1
Our	1
fugitives	1
returned,	1
the	1
battalions	1
re-formed,	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
had	1
nearly	1
cut	1
our	1
left	1
flank	1
in	1
half	1
were	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
repulsed.	1
Our	1
reserve	1
units	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
join	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
The	1
regimental	1
commander	1
and	1
Major	1
Ekonomov	1
had	1
stopped	1
beside	1
a	1
bridge,	1
letting	1
the	1
retreating	1
companies	1
pass	1
by	1
them,	1
when	1
a	1
soldier	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
commander's	1
stirrup,	1
almost	1
leaning	1
against	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
wearing	1
a	1
bluish	1
coat	1
of	1
broadcloth,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
knapsack	1
or	1
cap,	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
bandaged,	1
and	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
a	1
French	1
munition	1
pouch	1
was	1
slung.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
officer's	1
sword	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
soldier	1
was	1
pale,	1
his	1
blue	1
eyes	1
looked	1
impudently	1
into	1
the	1
commander's	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
lips	1
were	1
smiling.	1
Though	1
the	1
commander	1
was	1
occupied	1
in	1
giving	1
instructions	1
to	1
Major	1
Ekonomov,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
soldier.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
trophies,"	1
said	1
Dolokhov,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
sword	1
and	1
pouch.	1
"I	1
have	1
taken	1
an	1
officer	1
prisoner.	1
I	1
stopped	1
the	1
company."	1
Dolokhov	1
breathed	1
heavily	1
from	1
weariness	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
abrupt	1
sentences.	1
"The	1
whole	1
company	1
can	1
bear	1
witness.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
remember	1
this,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
replied	1
the	1
commander,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Major	1
Ekonomov.	1
	1
But	1
Dolokhov	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
away;	1
he	1
untied	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
around	1
his	1
head,	1
pulled	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
showed	1
the	1
blood	1
congealed	1
on	1
his	1
hair.	1
	1
"A	1
bayonet	1
wound.	1
I	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
front.	1
Remember,	1
your	1
excellency!"	1
	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
and	1
only	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
did	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
still	1
hearing	1
the	1
cannonade	1
in	1
the	1
center,	1
send	1
his	1
orderly	1
staff	1
officer,	1
and	1
later	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
also,	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
battery	1
to	1
retire	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
When	1
the	1
supports	1
attached	1
to	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
had	1
been	1
moved	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
by	1
someone's	1
order,	1
the	1
battery	1
had	1
continued	1
firing	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
not	1
captured	1
by	1
the	1
French	1
because	1
the	1
enemy	1
could	1
not	1
surmise	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
effrontery	1
to	1
continue	1
firing	1
from	1
four	1
quite	1
undefended	1
guns.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
energetic	1
action	1
of	1
that	1
battery	1
led	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
here--in	1
the	1
center--the	1
main	1
Russian	1
forces	1
were	1
concentrated.	1
Twice	1
they	1
had	1
attempted	1
to	1
attack	1
this	1
point,	1
but	1
on	1
each	1
occasion	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
back	1
by	1
grapeshot	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
isolated	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
hillock.	1
	1
Soon	1
after	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
Tushin	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
setting	1
fire	1
to	1
Schon	1
Grabern.	1
	1
"Look	1
at	1
them	1
scurrying!	1
It's	1
burning!	1
Just	1
see	1
the	1
smoke!	1
Fine!	1
Grand!	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
smoke,	1
the	1
smoke!"	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
artillerymen,	1
brightening	1
up.	1
	1
All	1
the	1
guns,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
orders,	1
were	1
being	1
fired	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration.	1
As	1
if	1
urging	1
each	1
other	1
on,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cried	1
at	1
each	1
shot:	1
"Fine!	1
That's	1
good!	1
Look	1
at	1
it...	1
Grand!"	1
The	1
fire,	1
fanned	1
by	1
the	1
breeze,	1
was	1
rapidly	1
spreading.	1
The	1
French	1
columns	1
that	1
had	1
advanced	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
went	1
back;	1
but	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
this	1
failure,	1
the	1
enemy	1
placed	1
ten	1
guns	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
began	1
firing	1
them	1
at	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
	1
In	1
their	1
childlike	1
glee,	1
aroused	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
their	1
luck	1
in	1
successfully	1
cannonading	1
the	1
French,	1
our	1
artillerymen	1
only	1
noticed	1
this	1
battery	1
when	1
two	1
balls,	1
and	1
then	1
four	1
more,	1
fell	1
among	1
our	1
guns,	1
one	1
knocking	1
over	1
two	1
horses	1
and	1
another	1
tearing	1
off	1
a	1
munition-wagon	1
driver's	1
leg.	1
Their	1
spirits	1
once	1
roused	1
were,	1
however,	1
not	1
diminished,	1
but	1
only	1
changed	1
character.	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
others	1
from	1
a	1
reserve	1
gun	1
carriage,	1
the	1
wounded	1
were	1
carried	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
guns	1
were	1
turned	1
against	1
the	1
ten-gun	1
battery.	1
Tushin's	1
companion	1
officer	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
engagement	1
and	1
within	1
an	1
hour	1
seventeen	1
of	1
the	1
forty	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
guns'	1
crews	1
had	1
been	1
disabled,	1
but	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
were	1
still	1
as	1
merry	1
and	1
lively	1
as	1
ever.	1
Twice	1
they	1
noticed	1
the	1
French	1
appearing	1
below	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
fired	1
grapeshot	1
at	1
them.	1
	1
Little	1
Tushin,	1
moving	1
feebly	1
and	1
awkwardly,	1
kept	1
telling	1
his	1
orderly	1
to	1
"refill	1
my	1
pipe	1
for	1
that	1
one!"	1
and	1
then,	1
scattering	1
sparks	1
from	1
it,	1
ran	1
forward	1
shading	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
small	1
hand	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
French.	1
	1
"Smack	1
at	1
'em,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
seizing	1
the	1
guns	1
by	1
the	1
wheels	1
and	1
working	1
the	1
screws	1
himself.	1
	1
Amid	1
the	1
smoke,	1
deafened	1
by	1
the	1
incessant	1
reports	1
which	1
always	1
made	1
him	1
jump,	1
Tushin	1
not	1
taking	1
his	1
pipe	1
from	1
his	1
mouth	1
ran	1
from	1
gun	1
to	1
gun,	1
now	1
aiming,	1
now	1
counting	1
the	1
charges,	1
now	1
giving	1
orders	1
about	1
replacing	1
dead	1
or	1
wounded	1
horses	1
and	1
harnessing	1
fresh	1
ones,	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
his	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
so	1
high	1
pitched	1
and	1
irresolute.	1
His	1
face	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
Only	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
killed	1
or	1
wounded	1
did	1
he	1
frown	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight,	1
shouting	1
angrily	1
at	1
the	1
men	1
who,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case,	1
hesitated	1
about	1
lifting	1
the	1
injured	1
or	1
dead.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
handsome	1
fellows	1
and,	1
as	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
an	1
artillery	1
company,	1
a	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
taller	1
and	1
twice	1
as	1
broad	1
as	1
their	1
officer--all	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
commander	1
like	1
children	1
in	1
an	1
embarrassing	1
situation,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
invariably	1
reflected	1
on	1
theirs.	1
	1
Owing	1
to	1
the	1
terrible	1
uproar	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
concentration	1
and	1
activity,	1
Tushin	1
did	1
not	1
experience	1
the	1
slightest	1
unpleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
fear,	1
and	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
killed	1
or	1
badly	1
wounded	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
elated.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
almost	1
a	1
day,	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
seen	1
the	1
enemy	1
and	1
fired	1
the	1
first	1
shot,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
he	1
stood	1
on	1
was	1
well-known	1
and	1
familiar	1
ground.	1
Though	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
everything,	1
considered	1
everything,	1
and	1
did	1
everything	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
officers	1
could	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
position,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
akin	1
to	1
feverish	1
delirium	1
or	1
drunkenness.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
deafening	1
sounds	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
guns	1
around	1
him,	1
the	1
whistle	1
and	1
thud	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
cannon	1
balls,	1
from	1
the	1
flushed	1
and	1
perspiring	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
bustling	1
round	1
the	1
guns,	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
horses,	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
puffs	1
of	1
smoke	1
on	1
the	1
enemy's	1
side	1
(always	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
ball	1
flying	1
past	1
and	1
striking	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
man,	1
a	1
gun,	1
a	1
horse),	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
a	1
fantastic	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure.	1
The	1
enemy's	1
guns	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
fancy	1
not	1
guns	1
but	1
pipes	1
from	1
which	1
occasional	1
puffs	1
were	1
blown	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
smoker.	1
	1
"There...	1
he's	1
puffing	1
again,"	1
muttered	1
Tushin	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
cloud	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
was	1
borne	1
in	1
a	1
streak	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
wind.	1
	1
"Now	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
ball...	1
we'll	1
throw	1
it	1
back."	1
	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
want,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
asked	1
an	1
artilleryman,	1
standing	1
close	1
by,	1
who	1
heard	1
him	1
muttering.	1
	1
"Nothing...	1
only	1
a	1
shell..."	1
he	1
answered.	1
	1
"Come	1
along,	1
our	1
Matvevna!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
"Matvevna"	1
*	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
his	1
fancy	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
farthest	1
gun	1
of	1
the	1
battery,	1
which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
pattern.	1
The	1
French	1
swarming	1
round	1
their	1
guns	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
ants.	1
In	1
that	1
world,	1
the	1
handsome	1
drunkard	1
Number	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
gun's	1
crew	1
was	1
"uncle";	1
Tushin	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
often	1
than	1
at	1
anyone	1
else	1
and	1
took	1
delight	1
in	1
his	1
every	1
movement.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
musketry	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
now	1
diminishing,	1
now	1
increasing,	1
seemed	1
like	1
someone's	1
breathing.	1
He	1
listened	1
intently	1
to	1
the	1
ebb	1
and	1
flow	1
of	1
these	1
sounds.	1
	1
	1
*	1
Daughter	1
of	1
Matthew.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
Breathing	1
again,	1
breathing!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
He	1
imagined	1
himself	1
as	1
an	1
enormously	1
tall,	1
powerful	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
throwing	1
cannon	1
balls	1
at	1
the	1
French	1
with	1
both	1
hands.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
Matvevna,	1
dear	1
old	1
lady,	1
don't	1
let	1
me	1
down!"	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
gun,	1
when	1
a	1
strange,	1
unfamiliar	1
voice	1
called	1
above	1
his	1
head:	1
"Captain	1
Tushin!	1
Captain!"	1
	1
Tushin	1
turned	1
round	1
in	1
dismay.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
turned	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
booth	1
at	1
Grunth.	1
He	1
was	1
shouting	1
in	1
a	1
gasping	1
voice:	1
	1
"Are	1
you	1
mad?	1
You	1
have	1
twice	1
been	1
ordered	1
to	1
retreat,	1
and	1
you..."	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
they	1
down	1
on	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Tushin,	1
looking	1
in	1
alarm	1
at	1
his	1
superior.	1
	1
"I...	1
don't..."	1
he	1
muttered,	1
holding	1
up	1
two	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
cap.	1
"I..."	1
	1
But	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
did	1
not	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
say.	1
A	1
cannon	1
ball,	1
flying	1
close	1
to	1
him,	1
caused	1
him	1
to	1
duck	1
and	1
bend	1
over	1
his	1
horse.	1
He	1
paused,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
more,	1
another	1
ball	1
stopped	1
him.	1
He	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
off.	1
	1
"Retire!	1
All	1
to	1
retire!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
	1
The	1
soldiers	1
laughed.	1
A	1
moment	1
later,	1
an	1
adjutant	1
arrived	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
order.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
on	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
space	1
where	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
were	1
stationed	1
was	1
an	1
unharnessed	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
leg,	1
that	1
lay	1
screaming	1
piteously	1
beside	1
the	1
harnessed	1
horses.	1
Blood	1
was	1
gushing	1
from	1
its	1
leg	1
as	1
from	1
a	1
spring.	1
Among	1
the	1
limbers	1
lay	1
several	1
dead	1
men.	1
One	1
ball	1
after	1
another	1
passed	1
over	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
nervous	1
shudder	1
run	1
down	1
his	1
spine.	1
But	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
afraid	1
roused	1
him	1
again.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
afraid,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
dismounted	1
slowly	1
among	1
the	1
guns.	1
He	1
delivered	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
battery.	1
He	1
decided	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
guns	1
removed	1
from	1
their	1
positions	1
and	1
withdrawn	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
Together	1
with	1
Tushin,	1
stepping	1
across	1
the	1
bodies	1
and	1
under	1
a	1
terrible	1
fire	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
guns.	1
	1
"A	1
staff	1
officer	1
was	1
here	1
a	1
minute	1
ago,	1
but	1
skipped	1
off,"	1
said	1
an	1
artilleryman	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Not	1
like	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
so	1
busy	1
as	1
to	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
one	1
another.	1
When	1
having	1
limbered	1
up	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
cannon	1
that	1
remained	1
uninjured	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
four,	1
they	1
began	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
(one	1
shattered	1
gun	1
and	1
one	1
unicorn	1
were	1
left	1
behind),	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Well,	1
till	1
we	1
meet	1
again..."	1
he	1
said,	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"Dear	1
soul!	1
Good-bye,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
unknown	1
reason	1
tears	1
suddenly	1
filled	1
his	1
eyes.	1

CHAPTER	1
XXI	1
	1
The	1
wind	1
had	1
fallen	1
and	1
black	1
clouds,	1
merging	1
with	1
the	1
powder	1
smoke,	1
hung	1
low	1
over	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
on	1
the	1
horizon.	1
It	1
was	1
growing	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
two	1
conflagrations	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
conspicuous.	1
The	1
cannonade	1
was	1
dying	1
down,	1
but	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
musketry	1
behind	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
sounded	1
oftener	1
and	1
nearer.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Tushin	1
with	1
his	1
guns,	1
continually	1
driving	1
round	1
or	1
coming	1
upon	1
wounded	1
men,	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
range	1
of	1
fire	1
and	1
had	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
dip,	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
staff,	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
sent	1
to	1
Tushin's	1
battery	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
it.	1
Interrupting	1
one	1
another,	1
they	1
all	1
gave,	1
and	1
transmitted,	1
orders	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
proceed,	1
reprimanding	1
and	1
reproaching	1
him.	1
Tushin	1
gave	1
no	1
orders,	1
and,	1
silently--	1
fearing	1
to	1
speak	1
because	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
felt	1
ready	1
to	1
weep	1
without	1
knowing	1
why--rode	1
behind	1
on	1
his	1
artillery	1
nag.	1
Though	1
the	1
orders	1
were	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
wounded,	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
dragged	1
themselves	1
after	1
troops	1
and	1
begged	1
for	1
seats	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriages.	1
The	1
jaunty	1
infantry	1
officer	1
who	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
battle	1
had	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
Tushin's	1
wattle	1
shed	1
was	1
laid,	1
with	1
a	1
bullet	1
in	1
his	1
stomach,	1
on	1
"Matvevna's"	1
carriage.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
a	1
pale	1
hussar	1
cadet,	1
supporting	1
one	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
seat.	1
	1
"Captain,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!	1
I've	1
hurt	1
my	1
arm,"	1
he	1
said	1
timidly.	1
"For	1
God's	1
sake...	1
I	1
can't	1
walk.	1
For	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
this	1
cadet	1
had	1
already	1
repeatedly	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
lift	1
and	1
been	1
refused.	1
He	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
hesitating,	1
piteous	1
voice.	1
	1
"Tell	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
seat,	1
for	1
God's	1
sake!"	1
	1
"Give	1
him	1
a	1
seat,"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
"Lay	1
a	1
cloak	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
on,	1
lad,"	1
he	1
said,	1
addressing	1
his	1
favorite	1
soldier.	1
"And	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
wounded	1
officer?"	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
set	1
down.	1
He	1
died,"	1
replied	1
someone.	1
	1
"Help	1
him	1
up.	1
Sit	1
down,	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
sit	1
down!	1
Spread	1
out	1
the	1
cloak,	1
Antonov."	1
	1
The	1
cadet	1
was	1
Rostov.	1
With	1
one	1
hand	1
he	1
supported	1
the	1
other;	1
he	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
his	1
jaw	1
trembled,	1
shivering	1
feverishly.	1
He	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
"Matvevna,"	1
the	1
gun	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
removed	1
the	1
dead	1
officer.	1
The	1
cloak	1
they	1
spread	1
under	1
him	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
blood	1
which	1
stained	1
his	1
breeches	1
and	1
arm.	1
	1
"What,	1
are	1
you	1
wounded,	1
my	1
lad?"	1
said	1
Tushin,	1
approaching	1
the	1
gun	1
on	1
which	1
Rostov	1
sat.	1
	1
"No,	1
it's	1
a	1
sprain."	1
	1
"Then	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
blood	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriage?"	1
inquired	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
the	1
officer,	1
your	1
honor,	1
stained	1
it,"	1
answered	1
the	1
artilleryman,	1
wiping	1
away	1
the	1
blood	1
with	1
his	1
coat	1
sleeve,	1
as	1
if	1
apologizing	1
for	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
gun.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
guns	1
up	1
the	1
rise	1
aided	1
by	1
the	1
infantry,	1
and	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Gruntersdorf	1
they	1
halted.	1
It	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
the	1
uniforms	1
ten	1
paces	1
off,	1
and	1
the	1
firing	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
subside.	1
Suddenly,	1
near	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
shouting	1
and	1
firing	1
were	1
again	1
heard.	1
Flashes	1
of	1
shot	1
gleamed	1
in	1
the	1
darkness.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
French	1
attack	1
and	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
soldiers	1
who	1
had	1
sheltered	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
houses.	1
They	1
all	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
again,	1
but	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
could	1
not	1
move,	1
and	1
the	1
artillerymen,	1
Tushin,	1
and	1
the	1
cadet	1
exchanged	1
silent	1
glances	1
as	1
they	1
awaited	1
their	1
fate.	1
The	1
firing	1
died	1
down	1
and	1
soldiers,	1
talking	1
eagerly,	1
streamed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
side	1
street.	1
	1
"Not	1
hurt,	1
Petrov?"	1
asked	1
one.	1
	1
"We've	1
given	1
it	1
'em	1
hot,	1
mate!	1
They	1
won't	1
make	1
another	1
push	1
now,"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"You	1
couldn't	1
see	1
a	1
thing.	1
How	1
they	1
shot	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
fellows!	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen.	1
Pitch-dark,	1
brother!	1
Isn't	1
there	1
something	1
to	1
drink?"	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
repulsed	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
And	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
complete	1
darkness	1
Tushin's	1
guns	1
moved	1
forward,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
humming	1
infantry	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
frame.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
darkness,	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
a	1
gloomy	1
unseen	1
river	1
was	1
flowing	1
always	1
in	1
one	1
direction,	1
humming	1
with	1
whispers	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
wheels.	1
Amid	1
the	1
general	1
rumble,	1
the	1
groans	1
and	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
were	1
more	1
distinctly	1
heard	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
The	1
gloom	1
that	1
enveloped	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
their	1
groans,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
melt	1
into	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
moving	1
mass	1
became	1
agitated,	1
someone	1
rode	1
past	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
horse	1
followed	1
by	1
his	1
suite,	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
passing:	1
"What	1
did	1
he	1
say?	1
Where	1
to,	1
now?	1
Halt,	1
is	1
it?	1
Did	1
he	1
thank	1
us?"	1
came	1
eager	1
questions	1
from	1
all	1
sides.	1
The	1
whole	1
moving	1
mass	1
began	1
pressing	1
closer	1
together	1
and	1
a	1
report	1
spread	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
halt:	1
evidently	1
those	1
in	1
front	1
had	1
halted.	1
All	1
remained	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
muddy	1
road.	1
	1
Fires	1
were	1
lighted	1
and	1
the	1
talk	1
became	1
more	1
audible.	1
Captain	1
Tushin,	1
having	1
given	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
company,	1
sent	1
a	1
soldier	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
dressing	1
station	1
or	1
a	1
doctor	1
for	1
the	1
cadet,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
a	1
bonfire	1
the	1
soldiers	1
had	1
kindled	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
Rostov,	1
too,	1
dragged	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
fire.	1
From	1
pain,	1
cold,	1
and	1
damp,	1
a	1
feverish	1
shivering	1
shook	1
his	1
whole	1
body.	1
Drowsiness	1
was	1
irresistibly	1
mastering	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
kept	1
awake	1
by	1
an	1
excruciating	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
arm,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
position.	1
He	1
kept	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
fire,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dazzlingly	1
red,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
feeble,	1
round-shouldered	1
figure	1
of	1
Tushin	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
cross-legged	1
like	1
a	1
Turk	1
beside	1
him.	1
Tushin's	1
large,	1
kind,	1
intelligent	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
with	1
sympathy	1
and	1
commiseration	1
on	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
saw	1
that	1
Tushin	1
with	1
his	1
whole	1
heart	1
wished	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
were	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
and	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
infantry,	1
who	1
were	1
walking,	1
driving	1
past,	1
and	1
settling	1
down	1
all	1
around.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
voices,	1
the	1
tramping	1
feet,	1
the	1
horses'	1
hoofs	1
moving	1
in	1
mud,	1
the	1
crackling	1
of	1
wood	1
fires	1
near	1
and	1
afar,	1
merged	1
into	1
one	1
tremulous	1
rumble.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
longer,	1
as	1
before,	1
a	1
dark,	1
unseen	1
river	1
flowing	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
but	1
a	1
dark	1
sea	1
swelling	1
and	1
gradually	1
subsiding	1
after	1
a	1
storm.	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
and	1
listened	1
listlessly	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
before	1
and	1
around	1
him.	1
An	1
infantryman	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
squatted	1
on	1
his	1
heels,	1
held	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
blaze,	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
face.	1
	1
"You	1
don't	1
mind	1
your	1
honor?"	1
he	1
asked	1
Tushin.	1
"I've	1
lost	1
my	1
company,	1
your	1
honor.	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
where...	1
such	1
bad	1
luck!"	1
	1
With	1
the	1
soldier,	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer	1
with	1
a	1
bandaged	1
cheek	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
bonfire,	1
and	1
addressing	1
Tushin	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
guns	1
moved	1
a	1
trifle	1
to	1
let	1
a	1
wagon	1
go	1
past.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone,	1
two	1
soldiers	1
rushed	1
to	1
the	1
campfire.	1
They	1
were	1
quarreling	1
and	1
fighting	1
desperately,	1
each	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
boot	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
holding	1
on	1
to.	1
	1
"You	1
picked	1
it	1
up?...	1
I	1
dare	1
say!	1
You're	1
very	1
smart!"	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shouted	1
hoarsely.	1
	1
Then	1
a	1
thin,	1
pale	1
soldier,	1
his	1
neck	1
bandaged	1
with	1
a	1
bloodstained	1
leg	1
band,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
angry	1
tones	1
asked	1
the	1
artillerymen	1
for	1
water.	1
	1
"Must	1
one	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
dog?"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
Tushin	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
man	1
some	1
water.	1
Then	1
a	1
cheerful	1
soldier	1
ran	1
up,	1
begging	1
a	1
little	1
fire	1
for	1
the	1
infantry.	1
	1
"A	1
nice	1
little	1
hot	1
torch	1
for	1
the	1
infantry!	1
Good	1
luck	1
to	1
you,	1
fellow	1
countrymen.	1
Thanks	1
for	1
the	1
fire--we'll	1
return	1
it	1
with	1
interest,"	1
said	1
he,	1
carrying	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
a	1
glowing	1
stick.	1
	1
Next	1
came	1
four	1
soldiers,	1
carrying	1
something	1
heavy	1
on	1
a	1
cloak,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
fire.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
stumbled.	1
	1
"Who	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
put	1
the	1
logs	1
on	1
the	1
road?"	1
snarled	1
he.	1
	1
"He's	1
dead--why	1
carry	1
him?"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"Shut	1
up!"	1
	1
And	1
they	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
darkness	1
with	1
their	1
load.	1
	1
"Still	1
aching?"	1
Tushin	1
asked	1
Rostov	1
in	1
a	1
whisper.	1
	1
"Yes."	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
you're	1
wanted	1
by	1
the	1
general.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hut	1
here,"	1
said	1
a	1
gunner,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
Tushin.	1
	1
"Coming,	1
friend."	1
	1
Tushin	1
rose	1
and,	1
buttoning	1
his	1
greatcoat	1
and	1
pulling	1
it	1
straight,	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
artillery	1
campfire,	1
in	1
a	1
hut	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
for	1
him,	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
sat	1
at	1
dinner,	1
talking	1
with	1
some	1
commanding	1
officers	1
who	1
had	1
gathered	1
at	1
his	1
quarters.	1
The	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
was	1
there	1
greedily	1
gnawing	1
a	1
mutton	1
bone,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
served	1
blamelessly	1
for	1
twenty-two	1
years,	1
flushed	1
by	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
vodka	1
and	1
the	1
dinner;	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
with	1
the	1
signet	1
ring,	1
and	1
Zherkov,	1
uneasily	1
glancing	1
at	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
pale,	1
with	1
compressed	1
lips	1
and	1
feverishly	1
glittering	1
eyes.	1
	1
In	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
stood	1
a	1
standard	1
captured	1
from	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
the	1
accountant	1
with	1
the	1
naive	1
face	1
was	1
feeling	1
its	1
texture,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
perplexity--perhaps	1
because	1
the	1
banner	1
really	1
interested	1
him,	1
perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
him,	1
hungry	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
dinner	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
place	1
for	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
hut	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
French	1
colonel	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
by	1
our	1
dragoons.	1
Our	1
officers	1
were	1
flocking	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
was	1
thanking	1
the	1
individual	1
commanders	1
and	1
inquiring	1
into	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
and	1
our	1
losses.	1
The	1
general	1
whose	1
regiment	1
had	1
been	1
inspected	1
at	1
Braunau	1
was	1
informing	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
action	1
began	1
he	1
had	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
wood,	1
mustered	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
woodcutting,	1
and,	1
allowing	1
the	1
French	1
to	1
pass	1
him,	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
bayonet	1
charge	1
with	1
two	1
battalions	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
French	1
troops.	1
	1
"When	1
I	1
saw,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
that	1
their	1
first	1
battalion	1
was	1
disorganized,	1
I	1
stopped	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
thought:	1
'I'll	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
on	1
and	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion'--and	1
that's	1
what	1
I	1
did."	1
	1
The	1
general	1
had	1
so	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
managed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
really	1
happened.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
really	1
have	1
been	1
so?	1
Could	1
one	1
possibly	1
make	1
out	1
amid	1
all	1
that	1
confusion	1
what	1
did	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
happen?	1
	1
"By	1
the	1
way,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
I	1
should	1
inform	1
you,"	1
he	1
continued--	1
remembering	1
Dolokhov's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
his	1
last	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman-ranker--"that	1
Private	1
Dolokhov,	1
who	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks,	1
took	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
prisoner	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
particularly	1
distinguished	1
himself."	1
	1
"I	1
saw	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars	1
attack	1
there,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
chimed	1
in	1
Zherkov,	1
looking	1
uneasily	1
around.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
hussars	1
all	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
them	1
from	1
an	1
infantry	1
officer.	1
"They	1
broke	1
up	1
two	1
squares,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
Several	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
smiled	1
at	1
Zherkov's	1
words,	1
expecting	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
jokes,	1
but	1
noticing	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
redounded	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
arms	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
day's	1
work,	1
they	1
assumed	1
a	1
serious	1
expression,	1
though	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
a	1
lie	1
devoid	1
of	1
any	1
foundation.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
colonel:	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
all;	1
all	1
arms	1
have	1
behaved	1
heroically:	1
infantry,	1
cavalry,	1
and	1
artillery.	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
two	1
guns	1
were	1
abandoned	1
in	1
the	1
center?"	1
he	1
inquired,	1
searching	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
someone.	1
(Prince	1
Bagration	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
about	1
the	1
guns	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank;	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
guns	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
abandoned	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
action.)	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
sent	1
you?"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
staff	1
officer	1
on	1
duty.	1
	1
"One	1
was	1
damaged,"	1
answered	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
"and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
can't	1
understand.	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
left....	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hot	1
there,"	1
he	1
added,	1
modestly.	1
	1
Someone	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
was	1
bivouacking	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
sent	1
for.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
but	1
you	1
were	1
there?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
addressing	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
we	1
only	1
just	1
missed	1
one	1
another,"	1
said	1
the	1
staff	1
officer,	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
coldly	1
and	1
abruptly.	1
	1
All	1
were	1
silent.	1
Tushin	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
threshold	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
timidly	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
the	1
generals.	1
As	1
he	1
stepped	1
past	1
the	1
generals	1
in	1
the	1
crowded	1
hut,	1
feeling	1
embarrassed	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
superiors,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
notice	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
banner	1
and	1
stumbled	1
over	1
it.	1
Several	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
laughed.	1
	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
gun	1
was	1
abandoned?"	1
asked	1
Bagration,	1
frowning,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
captain	1
as	1
at	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
laughing,	1
among	1
whom	1
Zherkov	1
laughed	1
loudest.	1
	1
Only	1
now,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
confronted	1
by	1
the	1
stern	1
authorities,	1
did	1
his	1
guilt	1
and	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
having	1
lost	1
two	1
guns	1
and	1
yet	1
remaining	1
alive	1
present	1
themselves	1
to	1
Tushin	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
horror.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
excited	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
about	1
it	1
until	1
that	1
moment.	1
The	1
officers'	1
laughter	1
confused	1
him	1
still	1
more.	1
He	1
stood	1
before	1
Bagration	1
with	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw	1
trembling	1
and	1
was	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
mutter:	1
"I	1
don't	1
know...	1
your	1
excellency...	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
men...	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"You	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
some	1
from	1
the	1
covering	1
troops."	1
	1
Tushin	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
covering	1
troops,	1
though	1
that	1
was	1
perfectly	1
true.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
getting	1
some	1
other	1
officer	1
into	1
trouble,	1
and	1
silently	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bagration	1
as	1
a	1
schoolboy	1
who	1
has	1
blundered	1
looks	1
at	1
an	1
examiner.	1
	1
The	1
silence	1
lasted	1
some	1
time.	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
apparently	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
severe,	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
say;	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
intervene.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
looked	1
at	1
Tushin	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
and	1
his	1
fingers	1
twitched	1
nervously.	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency!"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
broke	1
the	1
silence	1
with	1
his	1
abrupt	1
voice,	1
"you	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
Captain	1
Tushin's	1
battery.	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
and	1
found	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
and	1
horses	1
knocked	1
out,	1
two	1
guns	1
smashed,	1
and	1
no	1
supports	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Tushin	1
looked	1
with	1
equal	1
intentness	1
at	1
Bolkonski,	1
who	1
spoke	1
with	1
suppressed	1
agitation.	1
	1
"And,	1
if	1
your	1
excellency	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
opinion,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"we	1
owe	1
today's	1
success	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
that	1
battery	1
and	1
the	1
heroic	1
endurance	1
of	1
Captain	1
Tushin	1
and	1
his	1
company,"	1
and	1
without	1
awaiting	1
a	1
reply,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
rose	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
looked	1
at	1
Tushin,	1
evidently	1
reluctant	1
to	1
show	1
distrust	1
in	1
Bolkonski's	1
emphatic	1
opinion	1
yet	1
not	1
feeling	1
able	1
fully	1
to	1
credit	1
it,	1
bent	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
told	1
Tushin	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
"Thank	1
you;	1
you	1
saved	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!"	1
said	1
Tushin.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
He	1
felt	1
sad	1
and	1
depressed.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
strange,	1
so	1
unlike	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
hoped.	1
	1
"Who	1
are	1
they?	1
Why	1
are	1
they	1
here?	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
want?	1
And	1
when	1
will	1
all	1
this	1
end?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
changing	1
shadows	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
arm	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
intense.	1
Irresistible	1
drowsiness	1
overpowered	1
him,	1
red	1
rings	1
danced	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
those	1
voices	1
and	1
faces	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
loneliness	1
merged	1
with	1
the	1
physical	1
pain.	1
It	1
was	1
they,	1
these	1
soldiers--wounded	1
and	1
unwounded--it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
crushing,	1
weighing	1
down,	1
and	1
twisting	1
the	1
sinews	1
and	1
scorching	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
sprained	1
arm	1
and	1
shoulder.	1
To	1
rid	1
himself	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
dozed,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
short	1
interval	1
innumerable	1
things	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream:	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
large	1
white	1
hand,	1
Sonya's	1
thin	1
little	1
shoulders,	1
Natasha's	1
eyes	1
and	1
laughter,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
mustache,	1
and	1
Telyanin	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
affair	1
with	1
Telyanin	1
and	1
Bogdanich.	1
That	1
affair	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
this	1
soldier	1
with	1
the	1
harsh	1
voice,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
affair	1
and	1
this	1
soldier	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
agonizingly,	1
incessantly	1
pulling	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
always	1
dragging	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
direction.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
let	1
his	1
shoulder	1
move	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
ache--it	1
would	1
be	1
well--if	1
only	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
pull	1
it,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
up.	1
The	1
black	1
canopy	1
of	1
night	1
hung	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
yard	1
above	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
charcoal.	1
Flakes	1
of	1
falling	1
snow	1
were	1
fluttering	1
in	1
that	1
light.	1
Tushin	1
had	1
not	1
returned,	1
the	1
doctor	1
had	1
not	1
come.	1
He	1
was	1
alone	1
now,	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
naked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
warming	1
his	1
thin	1
yellow	1
body.	1
	1
"Nobody	1
wants	1
me!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"There	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
or	1
pity	1
me.	1
Yet	1
I	1
was	1
once	1
at	1
home,	1
strong,	1
happy,	1
and	1
loved."	1
He	1
sighed	1
and,	1
doing	1
so,	1
groaned	1
involuntarily.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
is	1
anything	1
hurting	1
you?"	1
asked	1
the	1
soldier,	1
shaking	1
his	1
shirt	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
grunt	1
and	1
added:	1
"What	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
men	1
have	1
been	1
crippled	1
today--frightful!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
soldier.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
snowflakes	1
fluttering	1
above	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
remembered	1
a	1
Russian	1
winter	1
at	1
his	1
warm,	1
bright	1
home,	1
his	1
fluffy	1
fur	1
coat,	1
his	1
quickly	1
gliding	1
sleigh,	1
his	1
healthy	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
affection	1
and	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
family.	1
"And	1
why	1
did	1
I	1
come	1
here?"	1
he	1
wondered.	1
	1
Next	1
day	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
did	1
not	1
renew	1
their	1
attack,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
detachment	1
was	1
reunited	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
army.	1

CHAPTER	1
I	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
deliberately	1
thought	1
out	1
his	1
plans.	1
Still	1
less	1
did	1
he	1
think	1
of	1
injuring	1
anyone	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
advantage.	1
He	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
on	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
getting	1
on	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
habit.	1
Schemes	1
and	1
devices	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
rightly	1
accounted	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
whole	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
were	1
constantly	1
shaping	1
themselves	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
circumstances	1
and	1
persons	1
he	1
met.	1
Of	1
these	1
plans	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
but	1
dozens,	1
some	1
only	1
beginning	1
to	1
form	1
themselves,	1
some	1
approaching	1
achievement,	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
disintegration.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
for	1
instance,	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"This	1
man	1
now	1
has	1
influence,	1
I	1
must	1
gain	1
his	1
confidence	1
and	1
friendship	1
and	1
through	1
him	1
obtain	1
a	1
special	1
grant."	1
Nor	1
did	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
himself:	1
"Pierre	1
is	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
I	1
must	1
entice	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
lend	1
me	1
the	1
forty	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
I	1
need."	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
position	1
his	1
instinct	1
immediately	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
could	1
be	1
useful,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
premeditation	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
to	1
gain	1
his	1
confidence,	1
flatter	1
him,	1
become	1
intimate	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
finally	1
make	1
his	1
request.	1
	1
He	1
had	1
Pierre	1
at	1
hand	1
in	1
Moscow	1
and	1
procured	1
for	1
him	1
an	1
appointment	1
as	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
Bedchamber,	1
which	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
conferred	1
the	1
status	1
of	1
Councilor	1
of	1
State,	1
and	1
insisted	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
accompanying	1
him	1
to	1
Petersburg	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
his	1
house.	1
With	1
apparent	1
absent-mindedness,	1
yet	1
with	1
unhesitating	1
assurance	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
right	1
thing,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
did	1
everything	1
to	1
get	1
Pierre	1
to	1
marry	1
his	1
daughter.	1
Had	1
he	1
thought	1
out	1
his	1
plans	1
beforehand	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
natural	1
and	1
shown	1
such	1
unaffected	1
familiarity	1
in	1
intercourse	1
with	1
everybody	1
both	1
above	1
and	1
below	1
him	1
in	1
social	1
standing.	1
Something	1
always	1
drew	1
him	1
toward	1
those	1
richer	1
and	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
rare	1
skill	1
in	1
seizing	1
the	1
most	1
opportune	1
moment	1
for	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
people.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
on	1
unexpectedly	1
becoming	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
felt	1
himself	1
after	1
his	1
recent	1
loneliness	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
cares	1
so	1
beset	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
that	1
only	1
in	1
bed	1
was	1
he	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
himself.	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
sign	1
papers,	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
at	1
government	1
offices,	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
clear	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
question	1
his	1
chief	1
steward,	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
estate	1
near	1
Moscow,	1
and	1
to	1
receive	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
formerly	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
existence	1
but	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
offended	1
and	1
grieved	1
had	1
he	1
chosen	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
These	1
different	1
people--	1
businessmen,	1
relations,	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
alike--were	1
all	1
disposed	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
young	1
heir	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
flattering	1
manner:	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
evidently	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
noble	1
qualities.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
hearing	1
such	1
words	1
as:	1
"With	1
your	1
remarkable	1
kindness,"	1
or,	1
"With	1
your	1
excellent	1
heart,"	1
"You	1
are	1
yourself	1
so	1
honorable	1
Count,"	1
or,	1
"Were	1
he	1
as	1
clever	1
as	1
you,"	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
till	1
he	1
began	1
sincerely	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
exceptional	1
kindness	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
intelligence,	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
was	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
intelligent.	1
Even	1
people	1
who	1
had	1
formerly	1
been	1
spiteful	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
unfriendly	1
now	1
became	1
gentle	1
and	1
affectionate.	1
The	1
angry	1
eldest	1
princess,	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
waist	1
and	1
hair	1
plastered	1
down	1
like	1
a	1
doll's,	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
Pierre's	1
room	1
after	1
the	1
funeral.	1
With	1
drooping	1
eyes	1
and	1
frequent	1
blushes	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sorry	1
about	1
their	1
past	1
misunderstandings	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
now	1
feel	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
anything,	1
except	1
only	1
for	1
permission,	1
after	1
the	1
blow	1
she	1
had	1
received,	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
so	1
loved	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
sacrificed	1
so	1
much.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
weeping	1
at	1
these	1
words.	1
Touched	1
that	1
this	1
statuesque	1
princess	1
could	1
so	1
change,	1
Pierre	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
forgiveness,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
for.	1
From	1
that	1
day	1
the	1
eldest	1
princess	1
quite	1
changed	1
toward	1
Pierre	1
and	1
began	1
knitting	1
a	1
striped	1
scarf	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
"Do	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
mon	1
cher;	1
after	1
all,	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
from	1
the	1
deceased,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
him,	1
handing	1
him	1
a	1
deed	1
to	1
sign	1
for	1
the	1
princess'	1
benefit.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
throw	1
this	1
bone--a	1
bill	1
for	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
rubles--to	1
the	1
poor	1
princess	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
inlaid	1
portfolio.	1
Pierre	1
signed	1
the	1
deed	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
grew	1
still	1
kinder.	1
The	1
younger	1
sisters	1
also	1
became	1
affectionate	1
to	1
him,	1
especially	1
the	1
youngest,	1
the	1
pretty	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
mole,	1
who	1
often	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
confused	1
by	1
her	1
smiles	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
confusion	1
when	1
meeting	1
him.	1
	1
It	1
seemed	1
so	1
natural	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
everyone	1
should	1
like	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
so	1
unnatural	1
had	1
anyone	1
disliked	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
sincerity	1
of	1
those	1
around	1
him.	1
Besides,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
himself	1
whether	1
these	1
people	1
were	1
sincere	1
or	1
not.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
busy	1
and	1
always	1
felt	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
mild	1
and	1
cheerful	1
intoxication.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
some	1
important	1
and	1
general	1
movement;	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
constantly	1
expected	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
grieve	1
and	1
disappoint	1
many	1
people,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
this	1
and	1
that,	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
what	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
still	1
that	1
happy	1
result	1
always	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
	1
More	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
Pierre's	1
affairs	1
and	1
of	1
Pierre	1
himself	1
in	1
those	1
early	1
days.	1
From	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
lad.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
oppressed	1
by	1
business,	1
weary	1
and	1
suffering,	1
who	1
yet	1
would	1
not,	1
for	1
pity's	1
sake,	1
leave	1
this	1
helpless	1
youth	1
who,	1
after	1
all,	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
such	1
enormous	1
wealth,	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
fate	1
and	1
the	1
designs	1
of	1
rogues.	1
During	1
the	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
Moscow	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
Pierre,	1
or	1
go	1
to	1
him	1
himself,	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
assurance,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
adding	1
every	1
time:	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
business	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
purely	1
out	1
of	1
charity	1
that	1
I	1
trouble	1
myself	1
about	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
also	1
know	1
quite	1
well	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
propose	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
possible."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
tomorrow	1
we	1
are	1
off	1
at	1
last,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
one	1
day,	1
closing	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
fingering	1
Pierre's	1
elbow,	1
speaking	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
saying	1
something	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
been	1
agreed	1
upon	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
altered.	1
"We	1
start	1
tomorrow	1
and	1
I'm	1
giving	1
you	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
carriage.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad.	1
All	1
our	1
important	1
business	1
here	1
is	1
now	1
settled,	1
and	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
off	1
long	1
ago.	1
Here	1
is	1
something	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
from	1
the	1
chancellor.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
entered	1
in	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
Bedchamber.	1
The	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
now	1
lies	1
open	1
before	1
you."	1
	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
wearied	1
assurance	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
were	1
pronounced,	1
Pierre,	1
who	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
considering	1
his	1
career,	1
wished	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
suggestion.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
interrupted	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
special	1
deep	1
cooing	1
tone,	1
precluding	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
interrupting	1
his	1
speech,	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
in	1
extreme	1
cases	1
when	1
special	1
persuasion	1
was	1
needed.	1
	1
"Mais,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
I	1
did	1
this	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
sake,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
my	1
conscience,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
thank	1
me	1
for.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
complained	1
yet	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
loved;	1
and	1
besides,	1
you	1
are	1
free,	1
you	1
could	1
throw	1
it	1
up	1
tomorrow.	1
But	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
everything	1
for	1
yourself	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
to	1
Petersburg.	1
It	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
these	1
terrible	1
recollections."	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
sighed.	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
my	1
boy.	1
And	1
my	1
valet	1
can	1
go	1
in	1
your	1
carriage.	1
Ah!	1
I	1
was	1
nearly	1
forgetting,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"You	1
know,	1
mon	1
cher,	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
some	1
accounts	1
to	1
settle,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
it;	1
you	1
won't	1
require	1
it.	1
We'll	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
accounts	1
later."	1
	1
By	1
"what	1
was	1
due	1
from	1
the	1
Ryazan	1
estate"	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
meant	1
several	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
quitrent	1
received	1
from	1
Pierre's	1
peasants,	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
had	1
retained	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
In	1
Petersburg,	1
as	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
Pierre	1
found	1
the	1
same	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
affection.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
the	1
post,	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
rank	1
(for	1
he	1
did	1
nothing),	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
procured	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
acquaintances,	1
invitations,	1
and	1
social	1
occupations	1
were	1
so	1
numerous	1
that,	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
Moscow,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
bewilderment,	1
bustle,	1
and	1
continual	1
expectation	1
of	1
some	1
good,	1
always	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
never	1
attained.	1
	1
Of	1
his	1
former	1
bachelor	1
acquaintances	1
many	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
Petersburg.	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
front;	1
Dolokhov	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
ranks;	1
Anatole	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
provinces;	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
abroad;	1
so	1
Pierre	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
nights	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
like	1
to	1
spend	1
them,	1
or	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mind	1
by	1
intimate	1
talks	1
with	1
a	1
friend	1
older	1
than	1
himself	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
respected.	1
His	1
whole	1
time	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls	1
and	1
was	1
spent	1
chiefly	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
stout	1
princess,	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
his	1
beautiful	1
daughter	1
Helene.	1
	1
Like	1
the	1
others,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
attitude	1
toward	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
Formerly	1
in	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
presence,	1
Pierre	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
place,	1
tactless	1
and	1
unsuitable,	1
that	1
remarks	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
clever	1
while	1
they	1
formed	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
became	1
foolish	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
them,	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
Hippolyte's	1
stupidest	1
remarks	1
came	1
out	1
clever	1
and	1
apt.	1
Now	1
everything	1
Pierre	1
said	1
was	1
charmant.	1
Even	1
if	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
so,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
and	1
only	1
refrained	1
out	1
of	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
modesty.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1805-6	1
Pierre	1
received	1
one	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
usual	1
pink	1
notes	1
with	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
which	1
was	1
added:	1
"You	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene	1
here,	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
delightful	1
to	1
see."	1
	1
When	1
he	1
read	1
that	1
sentence,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
some	1
link	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
recognized	1
had	1
grown	1
up	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Helene,	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
both	1
alarmed	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
obligation	1
were	1
being	1
imposed	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fulfill,	1
and	1
pleased	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
entertaining	1
supposition.	1
	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
"At	1
Home"	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
former	1
one,	1
only	1
the	1
novelty	1
she	1
offered	1
her	1
guests	1
this	1
time	1
was	1
not	1
Mortemart,	1
but	1
a	1
diplomatist	1
fresh	1
from	1
Berlin	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
latest	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander's	1
visit	1
to	1
Potsdam,	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
two	1
august	1
friends	1
had	1
pledged	1
themselves	1
in	1
an	1
indissoluble	1
alliance	1
to	1
uphold	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
justice	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
received	1
Pierre	1
with	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
melancholy,	1
evidently	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
recent	1
loss	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Count	1
Bezukhov	1
(everyone	1
constantly	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
assure	1
Pierre	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
greatly	1
afflicted	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
known),	1
and	1
her	1
melancholy	1
was	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
august	1
melancholy	1
she	1
showed	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
her	1
most	1
august	1
Majesty	1
the	1
Empress	1
Marya	1
Fedorovna.	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
flattered	1
by	1
this.	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
arranged	1
the	1
different	1
groups	1
in	1
her	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
her	1
habitual	1
skill.	1
The	1
large	1
group,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
the	1
generals,	1
had	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
diplomat.	1
Another	1
group	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
tea	1
table.	1
Pierre	1
wished	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
former,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna--who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
excited	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
commander	1
on	1
a	1
battlefield	1
to	1
whom	1
thousands	1
of	1
new	1
and	1
brilliant	1
ideas	1
occur	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
time	1
to	1
put	1
in	1
action--seeing	1
Pierre,	1
touched	1
his	1
sleeve	1
with	1
her	1
finger,	1
saying:	1
	1
"Wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
in	1
view	1
for	1
you	1
this	1
evening."	1
(She	1
glanced	1
at	1
Helene	1
and	1
smiled	1
at	1
her.)	1
"My	1
dear	1
Helene,	1
be	1
charitable	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
aunt	1
who	1
adores	1
you.	1
Go	1
and	1
keep	1
her	1
company	1
for	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
And	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
dull,	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
dear	1
count	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
accompany	1
you."	1
	1
The	1
beauty	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
aunt,	1
but	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
detained	1
Pierre,	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
final	1
necessary	1
instructions.	1
	1
"Isn't	1
she	1
exquisite?"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
stately	1
beauty	1
as	1
she	1
glided	1
away.	1
"And	1
how	1
she	1
carries	1
herself!	1
For	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
girl,	1
such	1
tact,	1
such	1
masterly	1
perfection	1
of	1
manner!	1
It	1
comes	1
from	1
her	1
heart.	1
Happy	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
wins	1
her!	1
With	1
her	1
the	1
least	1
worldly	1
of	1
men	1
would	1
occupy	1
a	1
most	1
brilliant	1
position	1
in	1
society.	1
Don't	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
your	1
opinion,"	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
let	1
Pierre	1
go.	1
	1
Pierre,	1
in	1
reply,	1
sincerely	1
agreed	1
with	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
Helene's	1
perfection	1
of	1
manner.	1
If	1
he	1
ever	1
thought	1
of	1
Helene,	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
remarkable	1
skill	1
in	1
appearing	1
silently	1
dignified	1
in	1
society.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
aunt	1
received	1
the	1
two	1
young	1
people	1
in	1
her	1
corner,	1
but	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
hiding	1
her	1
adoration	1
for	1
Helene	1
and	1
inclined	1
rather	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
fear	1
of	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
niece,	1
as	1
if	1
inquiring	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
people.	1
On	1
leaving	1
them,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
again	1
touched	1
Pierre's	1
sleeve,	1
saying:	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
won't	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
dull	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
again,"	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
at	1
Helene.	1
	1
Helene	1
smiled,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
implying	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
admit	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
her	1
without	1
being	1
enchanted.	1
The	1
aunt	1
coughed,	1
swallowed,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
French	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
Helene,	1
then	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
of	1
welcome	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
look.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
halting	1
conversation,	1
Helene	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
bright	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
to	1
everyone.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
smile,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
so	1
little	1
meaning	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
aunt	1
was	1
just	1
speaking	1
of	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
snuffboxes	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
Pierre's	1
father,	1
Count	1
Bezukhov,	1
and	1
showed	1
them	1
her	1
own	1
box.	1
Princess	1
Helene	1
asked	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
portrait	1
of	1
the	1
aunt's	1
husband	1
on	1
the	1
box	1
lid.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Vinesse,"	1
said	1
Pierre,	1
mentioning	1
a	1
celebrated	1
miniaturist,	1
and	1
he	1
leaned	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
while	1
trying	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table.	1
	1
He	1
half	1
rose,	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
round,	1
but	1
the	1
aunt	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
snuffbox,	1
passing	1
it	1
across	1
Helene's	1
back.	1
Helene	1
stooped	1
forward	1
to	1
make	1
room,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
She	1
was,	1
as	1
always	1
at	1
evening	1
parties,	1
wearing	1
a	1
dress	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
then	1
fashionable,	1
cut	1
very	1
low	1
at	1
front	1
and	1
back.	1
Her	1
bust,	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
seemed	1
like	1
marble	1
to	1
Pierre,	1
was	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
shortsighted	1
eyes	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
perceive	1
the	1
living	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders,	1
so	1
near	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
only	1
have	1
bent	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
her	1
body,	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
perfume,	1
and	1
the	1
creaking	1
of	1
her	1
corset	1
as	1
she	1
moved.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
marble	1
beauty	1
forming	1
a	1
complete	1
whole	1
with	1
her	1
dress,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
body	1
only	1
covered	1
by	1
her	1
garments.	1
And	1
having	1
once	1
seen	1
this	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
cannot	1
renew	1
an	1
illusion	1
we	1
have	1
once	1
seen	1
through.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
noticed	1
before	1
how	1
beautiful	1
I	1
am?"	1
Helene	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
"You	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman?	1
Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
may	1
belong	1
to	1
anyone--to	1
you	1
too,"	1
said	1
her	1
glance.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
Helene	1
not	1
only	1
could,	1
but	1
must,	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
this	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
with	1
her.	1
How	1
and	1
when	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
know	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
(he	1
even	1
felt,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
why,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
thing),	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
would	1
happen.	1
	1
Pierre	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes,	1
lifted	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
wished	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
distant	1
beauty	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
every	1
day	1
until	1
then,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
do	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
not,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
steppe	1
grass	1
through	1
the	1
mist	1
and	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
can	1
again	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
tree	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
once	1
recognized	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tuft	1
of	1
grass.	1
She	1
was	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
already	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
him,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
barrier	1
except	1
the	1
barrier	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
will.	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
corner,"	1
came	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
voice,	1
"I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
right	1
there."	1
	1
And	1
Pierre,	1
anxiously	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
anything	1
reprehensible,	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
blush.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
everyone	1
knew	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
himself.	1
	1
A	1
little	1
later	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
circle,	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
"I	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
refitting	1
your	1
Petersburg	1
house?"	1
	1
This	1
was	1
true.	1
The	1
architect	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary,	1
and	1
Pierre,	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
was	1
having	1
his	1
enormous	1
Petersburg	1
house	1
done	1
up.	1
	1
"That's	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
but	1
don't	1
move	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
friend	1
like	1
the	1
prince,"	1
she	1
said,	1
smiling	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"I	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
that.	1
Don't	1
I?	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
so	1
young.	1
You	1
need	1
advice.	1
Don't	1
be	1
angry	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
exercising	1
an	1
old	1
woman's	1
privilege."	1
	1
She	1
paused,	1
as	1
women	1
always	1
do,	1
expecting	1
something	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
mentioned	1
their	1
age.	1
"If	1
you	1
marry	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
different	1
thing,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
uniting	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
one	1
glance.	1
Pierre	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
Helene	1
nor	1
she	1
at	1
him.	1
But	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
terribly	1
close	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
colored.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
got	1
home	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
for	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
What	1
had	1
happened?	1
Nothing.	1
He	1
had	1
merely	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
of	1
whom	1
when	1
her	1
beauty	1
was	1
mentioned	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
absent-mindedly:	1
"Yes,	1
she's	1
good	1
looking,"	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
might	1
belong	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"But	1
she's	1
stupid.	1
I	1
have	1
myself	1
said	1
she	1
is	1
stupid,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"There	1
is	1
something	1
nasty,	1
something	1
wrong,	1
in	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
excites	1
in	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
Anatole	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
scandal	1
and	1
that	1
that's	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
away.	1
Hippolyte	1
is	1
her	1
brother...	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
her	1
father...	1
It's	1
bad...."	1
he	1
reflected,	1
but	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
this	1
(the	1
reflection	1
was	1
still	1
incomplete),	1
he	1
caught	1
himself	1
smiling	1
and	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
another	1
line	1
of	1
thought	1
had	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
while	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
worthlessness	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
dreaming	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
wife,	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
love	1
him	1
become	1
quite	1
different,	1
and	1
how	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
and	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
might	1
be	1
false.	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
saw	1
her	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
but	1
visualized	1
her	1
whole	1
body	1
only	1
veiled	1
by	1
its	1
gray	1
dress.	1
"But	1
no!	1
Why	1
did	1
this	1
thought	1
never	1
occur	1
to	1
me	1
before?"	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
told	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
something	1
unnatural,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
dishonorable,	1
in	1
this	1
marriage.	1
He	1
recalled	1
her	1
former	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
together.	1
He	1
recalled	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
words	1
and	1
looks	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
his	1
house,	1
recalled	1
thousands	1
of	1
such	1
hints	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
others,	1
and	1
was	1
seized	1
by	1
terror	1
lest	1
he	1
had	1
already,	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
bound	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
evidently	1
wrong	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
do.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
expressing	1
this	1
conviction	1
to	1
himself,	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
her	1
image	1
rose	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
womanly	1
beauty.	1

CHAPTER	1
II	1
	1
In	1
November,	1
1805,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
inspection	1
in	1
four	1
different	1
provinces.	1
He	1
had	1
arranged	1
this	1
for	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
neglected	1
estates	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
and	1
pick	1
up	1
his	1
son	1
Anatole	1
where	1
his	1
regiment	1
was	1
stationed,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
arrange	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
that	1
rich	1
old	1
man.	1
But	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
and	1
undertaking	1
these	1
new	1
affairs,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
to	1
settle	1
matters	1
with	1
Pierre,	1
who,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
had	1
latterly	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
at	1
home,	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
staying,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
absurd,	1
excited,	1
and	1
foolish	1
in	1
Helene's	1
presence	1
(as	1
a	1
lover	1
should	1
be),	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
proposed	1
to	1
her.	1
	1
"This	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
fine,	1
but	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
settled,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
to	1
himself,	1
with	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
sigh,	1
one	1
morning,	1
feeling	1
that	1
Pierre	1
who	1
was	1
under	1
such	1
obligations	1
to	1
him	1
("But	1
never	1
mind	1
that")	1
was	1
not	1
behaving	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
"Youth,	1
frivolity...	1
well,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
relishing	1
his	1
own	1
goodness	1
of	1
heart,	1
"but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
head.	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
tomorrow	1
will	1
be	1
Lelya's	1
name	1
day.	1
I	1
will	1
invite	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
people,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
then	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
affair--yes,	1
my	1
affair.	1
I	1
am	1
her	1
father."	1
	1
Six	1
weeks	1
after	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's	1
"At	1
Home"	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
sleepless	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
that	1
to	1
marry	1
Helene	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
calamity	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
avoid	1
her	1
and	1
go	1
away,	1
Pierre,	1
despite	1
that	1
decision,	1
had	1
not	1
left	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
and	1
felt	1
with	1
terror	1
that	1
in	1
people's	1
eyes	1
he	1
was	1
every	1
day	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
connected	1
with	1
her,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
conception	1
of	1
her,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
break	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
unite	1
his	1
fate	1
with	1
hers.	1
He	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
free	1
himself	1
but	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
(who	1
had	1
rarely	1
before	1
given	1
receptions)	1
now	1
hardly	1
let	1
a	1
day	1
go	1
by	1
without	1
having	1
an	1
evening	1
party	1
at	1
which	1
Pierre	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
unless	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
spoil	1
the	1
general	1
pleasure	1
and	1
disappoint	1
everyone's	1
expectation.	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
in	1
the	1
rare	1
moments	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
would	1
take	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
in	1
passing	1
and	1
draw	1
it	1
downwards,	1
or	1
absent-mindedly	1
hold	1
out	1
his	1
wrinkled,	1
clean-	1
shaven	1
cheek	1
for	1
Pierre	1
to	1
kiss	1
and	1
would	1
say:	1
"Till	1
tomorrow,"	1
or,	1
"Be	1
in	1
to	1
dinner	1
or	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
you,"	1
or,	1
"I	1
am	1
staying	1
in	1
for	1
your	1
sake,"	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
And	1
though	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
when	1
he	1
stayed	1
in	1
(as	1
he	1
said)	1
for	1
Pierre's	1
sake,	1
hardly	1
exchanged	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
words	1
with	1
him,	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
unable	1
to	1
disappoint	1
him.	1
Every	1
day	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing:	1
"It	1
is	1
time	1
I	1
understood	1
her	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
is.	1
Was	1
I	1
mistaken	1
before,	1
or	1
am	1
I	1
mistaken	1
now?	1
No,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid,	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
girl,"	1
he	1
sometimes	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
"she	1
never	1
makes	1
a	1
mistake,	1
never	1
says	1
anything	1
stupid.	1
She	1
says	1
little,	1
but	1
what	1
she	1
does	1
say	1
is	1
always	1
clear	1
and	1
simple,	1
so	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
stupid.	1
She	1
never	1
was	1
abashed	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
abashed	1
now,	1
so	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
woman!"	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
begun	1
to	1
make	1
reflections	1
or	1
think	1
aloud	1
in	1
her	1
company,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
answered	1
him	1
either	1
by	1
a	1
brief	1
but	1
appropriate	1
remark--showing	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
interest	1
her--or	1
by	1
a	1
silent	1
look	1
and	1
smile	1
which	1
more	1
palpably	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
showed	1
Pierre	1
her	1
superiority.	1
She	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
regarding	1
all	1
arguments	1
as	1
nonsense	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
smile.	1
	1
She	1
always	1
addressed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
radiantly	1
confiding	1
smile	1
meant	1
for	1
him	1
alone,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
significant	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
smile	1
that	1
usually	1
brightened	1
her	1
face.	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
and	1
cross	1
a	1
certain	1
line,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
step	1
across	1
it,	1
but	1
an	1
incomprehensible	1
terror	1
seized	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
dreadful	1
step.	1
A	1
thousand	1
times	1
during	1
that	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
while	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
drawn	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
that	1
dreadful	1
abyss,	1
Pierre	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
"What	1
am	1
I	1
doing?	1
I	1
need	1
resolution.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
none?"	1
	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
decision,	1
but	1
felt	1
with	1
dismay	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
he	1
lacked	1
that	1
strength	1
of	1
will	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
himself	1
and	1
really	1
possessed.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
only	1
strong	1
when	1
they	1
feel	1
themselves	1
quite	1
innocent,	1
and	1
since	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
desire	1
while	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
at	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna's,	1
an	1
unacknowledged	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
that	1
desire	1
paralyzed	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
On	1
Helene's	1
name	1
day,	1
a	1
small	1
party	1
of	1
just	1
their	1
own	1
people--as	1
his	1
wife	1
said--met	1
for	1
supper	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's.	1
All	1
these	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
girl	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
evening.	1
The	1
visitors	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
supper.	1
Princess	1
Kuragina,	1
a	1
portly	1
imposing	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
handsome,	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table.	1
On	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
sat	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
guests--an	1
old	1
general	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
Scherer.	1
At	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
sat	1
the	1
younger	1
and	1
less	1
important	1
guests,	1
and	1
there	1
too	1
sat	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene,	1
side	1
by	1
side.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
supper:	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
mood,	1
sitting	1
down	1
now	1
by	1
one,	1
now	1
by	1
another,	1
of	1
the	1
guests.	1
To	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
made	1
some	1
careless	1
and	1
agreeable	1
remark	1
except	1
to	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene,	1
whose	1
presence	1
he	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
notice.	1
He	1
enlivened	1
the	1
whole	1
party.	1
The	1
wax	1
candles	1
burned	1
brightly,	1
the	1
silver	1
and	1
crystal	1
gleamed,	1
so	1
did	1
the	1
ladies'	1
toilets	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
of	1
the	1
men's	1
epaulets;	1
servants	1
in	1
scarlet	1
liveries	1
moved	1
round	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
clatter	1
of	1
plates,	1
knives,	1
and	1
glasses	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
animated	1
hum	1
of	1
several	1
conversations.	1
At	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
old	1
chamberlain	1
was	1
heard	1
assuring	1
an	1
old	1
baroness	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
passionately,	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
laughed;	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
could	1
be	1
heard	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
some	1
Mary	1
Viktorovna	1
or	1
other.	1
At	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
attracted	1
everybody's	1
attention.	1
With	1
a	1
facetious	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
the	1
ladies	1
about	1
last	1
Wednesday's	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Council,	1
at	1
which	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
Vyazmitinov,	1
the	1
new	1
military	1
governor	1
general	1
of	1
Petersburg,	1
had	1
received	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
then	1
famous	1
rescript	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
from	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Emperor	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
receiving	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
declarations	1
of	1
the	1
people's	1
loyalty,	1
that	1
the	1
declaration	1
from	1
Petersburg	1
gave	1
him	1
particular	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nation	1
and	1
would	1
endeavor	1
to	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
it.	1
This	1
rescript	1
began	1
with	1
the	1
words:	1
"Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
From	1
all	1
sides	1
reports	1
reach	1
me,"	1
etc.	1
	1
"Well,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
never	1
got	1
farther	1
than:	1
'Sergey	1
Kuzmich'?"	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"Exactly,	1
not	1
a	1
hair's	1
breadth	1
farther,"	1
answered	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
laughing,	1
"'Sergey	1
Kuzmich...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich...'	1
Poor	1
Vyazmitinov	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
any	1
farther!	1
He	1
began	1
the	1
rescript	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
uttered	1
'Sergey'	1
he	1
sobbed,	1
'Kuz-mi-ch,'	1
tears,	1
and	1
'From	1
all	1
sides'	1
was	1
smothered	1
in	1
sobs	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
no	1
farther.	1
And	1
again	1
his	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
again:	1
'Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
From	1
all	1
sides,'...	1
and	1
tears,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
somebody	1
else	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
read	1
it."	1
	1
"Kuzmich...	1
From	1
all	1
sides...	1
and	1
then	1
tears,"	1
someone	1
repeated	1
laughing.	1
	1
"Don't	1
be	1
unkind,"	1
cried	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
from	1
her	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
threatening	1
finger.	1
"He	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
worthy	1
and	1
excellent	1
man,	1
our	1
dear	1
Vyazmitinov...."	1
	1
Everybody	1
laughed	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
At	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
where	1
the	1
honored	1
guests	1
sat,	1
everyone	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
exciting	1
sensations.	1
Only	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene	1
sat	1
silently	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
a	1
suppressed	1
smile	1
brightening	1
both	1
their	1
faces,	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich--a	1
smile	1
of	1
bashfulness	1
at	1
their	1
own	1
feelings.	1
But	1
much	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
laughed,	1
talked,	1
and	1
joked,	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
enjoyed	1
their	1
Rhine	1
wine,	1
saute,	1
and	1
ices,	1
and	1
however	1
they	1
avoided	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
young	1
couple,	1
and	1
heedless	1
and	1
unobservant	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
of	1
them,	1
one	1
could	1
feel	1
by	1
the	1
occasional	1
glances	1
they	1
gave	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
the	1
laughter,	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
were	1
all	1
a	1
pretense,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
attention	1
of	1
that	1
company	1
was	1
directed	1
to--	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
mimicked	1
the	1
sobbing	1
of	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
eyes	1
glanced	1
toward	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
laughed	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
clearly	1
said:	1
"Yes...	1
it's	1
getting	1
on,	1
it	1
will	1
all	1
be	1
settled	1
today."	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
threatened	1
him	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
"our	1
dear	1
Vyazmitinov,"	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
which,	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Pierre,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
read	1
a	1
congratulation	1
on	1
his	1
future	1
son-in-law	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
daughter's	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
sighed	1
sadly	1
as	1
she	1
offered	1
some	1
wine	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
lady	1
next	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
her	1
sigh	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Yes,	1
there's	1
nothing	1
left	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
sip	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
my	1
dear,	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
for	1
these	1
young	1
ones	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
boldly,	1
provocatively	1
happy."	1
"And	1
what	1
nonsense	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
saying!"	1
thought	1
a	1
diplomatist,	1
glancing	1
at	1
the	1
happy	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
lovers.	1
"That's	1
happiness!"	1
	1
Into	1
the	1
insignificant,	1
trifling,	1
and	1
artificial	1
interests	1
uniting	1
that	1
society	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
simple	1
feeling	1
of	1
the	1
attraction	1
of	1
a	1
healthy	1
and	1
handsome	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
for	1
one	1
another.	1
And	1
this	1
human	1
feeling	1
dominated	1
everything	1
else	1
and	1
soared	1
above	1
all	1
their	1
affected	1
chatter.	1
Jests	1
fell	1
flat,	1
news	1
was	1
not	1
interesting,	1
and	1
the	1
animation	1
was	1
evidently	1
forced.	1
Not	1
only	1
the	1
guests	1
but	1
even	1
the	1
footmen	1
waiting	1
at	1
table	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
this,	1
and	1
they	1
forgot	1
their	1
duties	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene	1
with	1
her	1
radiant	1
face	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
red,	1
broad,	1
and	1
happy	1
though	1
uneasy	1
face	1
of	1
Pierre.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
very	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
candles	1
was	1
focused	1
on	1
those	1
two	1
happy	1
faces	1
alone.	1
	1
Pierre	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
this	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
some	1
occupation.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
see,	1
hear,	1
or	1
understand	1
anything	1
clearly.	1
Only	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
detached	1
ideas	1
and	1
impressions	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
reality	1
shot	1
unexpectedly	1
through	1
his	1
mind.	1
	1
"So	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
finished!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"And	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
all	1
happened?	1
How	1
quickly!	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
alone,	1
nor	1
of	1
myself	1
alone,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
everyone,	1
it	1
must	1
inevitably	1
come	1
about.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
expecting	1
it,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
sure	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
happen	1
that	1
I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
cannot,	1
disappoint	1
them.	1
But	1
how	1
will	1
it	1
be?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
certainly	1
happen!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
glancing	1
at	1
those	1
dazzling	1
shoulders	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
Or	1
he	1
would	1
suddenly	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
of	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
awkward	1
to	1
attract	1
everyone's	1
attention	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
lucky	1
man	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
plain	1
face,	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Paris	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
Helen.	1
"But	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
always	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
so!"	1
he	1
consoled	1
himself.	1
"And	1
besides,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
about?	1
How	1
did	1
it	1
begin?	1
I	1
traveled	1
from	1
Moscow	1
with	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
Then	1
there	1
was	1
nothing.	1
So	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
not	1
stay	1
at	1
his	1
house?	1
Then	1
I	1
played	1
cards	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
picked	1
up	1
her	1
reticule	1
and	1
drove	1
out	1
with	1
her.	1
How	1
did	1
it	1
begin,	1
when	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
come	1
about?"	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
her	1
side	1
as	1
her	1
betrothed,	1
seeing,	1
hearing,	1
feeling	1
her	1
nearness,	1
her	1
breathing,	1
her	1
movements,	1
her	1
beauty.	1
Then	1
it	1
would	1
suddenly	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
she	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
why	1
they	1
all	1
looked	1
so	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
flattered	1
by	1
this	1
general	1
admiration	1
he	1
would	1
expand	1
his	1
chest,	1
raise	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
good	1
fortune.	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
familiar	1
voice	1
repeating	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
But	1
Pierre	1
was	1
so	1
absorbed	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
said.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
asking	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
last	1
heard	1
from	1
Bolkonski,"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
a	1
third	1
time.	1
"How	1
absent-minded	1
you	1
are,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow."	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
smiled,	1
and	1
Pierre	1
noticed	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
smiling	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
Helene.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
all	1
know	1
it?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
"What	1
of	1
it?	1
It's	1
the	1
truth!"	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
smiled	1
his	1
gentle	1
childlike	1
smile,	1
and	1
Helene	1
smiled	1
too.	1
	1
"When	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
letter?	1
Was	1
it	1
from	1
Olmutz?"	1
repeated	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
who	1
pretended	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
this	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
settle	1
a	1
dispute.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
one	1
talk	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
trifles?"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
from	1
Olmutz,"	1
he	1
answered,	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
	1
After	1
supper	1
Pierre	1
with	1
his	1
partner	1
followed	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
The	1
guests	1
began	1
to	1
disperse,	1
some	1
without	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Helene.	1
Some,	1
as	1
if	1
unwilling	1
to	1
distract	1
her	1
from	1
an	1
important	1
occupation,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
refusing	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
see	1
them	1
off.	1
The	1
diplomatist	1
preserved	1
a	1
mournful	1
silence	1
as	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
drawing	1
room.	1
He	1
pictured	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
his	1
diplomatic	1
career	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
Pierre's	1
happiness.	1
The	1
old	1
general	1
grumbled	1
at	1
his	1
wife	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
how	1
his	1
leg	1
was.	1
"Oh,	1
the	1
old	1
fool,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"That	1
Princess	1
Helene	1
will	1
be	1
beautiful	1
still	1
when	1
she's	1
fifty."	1
	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
congratulate	1
you,"	1
whispered	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
princess,	1
kissing	1
her	1
soundly.	1
"If	1
I	1
hadn't	1
this	1
headache	1
I'd	1
have	1
stayed	1
longer."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
did	1
not	1
reply,	1
she	1
was	1
tormented	1
by	1
jealousy	1
of	1
her	1
daughter's	1
happiness.	1
	1
While	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
taking	1
their	1
leave	1
Pierre	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
alone	1
with	1
Helene	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
He	1
had	1
often	1
before,	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
six	1
weeks,	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
her,	1
but	1
had	1
never	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
love.	1
Now	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
inevitable,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
final	1
step.	1
He	1
felt	1
ashamed;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
occupying	1
someone	1
else's	1
place	1
here	1
beside	1
Helene.	1
"This	1
happiness	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you,"	1
some	1
inner	1
voice	1
whispered	1
to	1
him.	1
"This	1
happiness	1
is	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
in	1
them	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
you."	1
	1
But,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
he	1
began	1
by	1
asking	1
her	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
party.	1
She	1
replied	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
simple	1
manner	1
that	1
this	1
name	1
day	1
of	1
hers	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
had.	1
	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
relatives	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
left.	1
They	1
were	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre	1
with	1
languid	1
footsteps.	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
late.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
stern	1
inquiry,	1
as	1
though	1
what	1
Pierre	1
had	1
just	1
said	1
was	1
so	1
strange	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
in.	1
But	1
then	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
severity	1
changed,	1
and	1
he	1
drew	1
Pierre's	1
hand	1
downwards,	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down,	1
and	1
smiled	1
affectionately.	1
	1
"Well,	1
Lelya?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
turning	1
instantly	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
addressing	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
careless	1
tone	1
of	1
habitual	1
tenderness	1
natural	1
to	1
parents	1
who	1
have	1
petted	1
their	1
children	1
from	1
babyhood,	1
but	1
which	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
only	1
acquired	1
by	1
imitating	1
other	1
parents.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
again	1
turned	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Sergey	1
Kuzmich--From	1
all	1
sides-"	1
he	1
said,	1
unbuttoning	1
the	1
top	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat.	1
	1
Pierre	1
smiled,	1
but	1
his	1
smile	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
story	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich	1
that	1
interested	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
just	1
then,	1
and	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
saw	1
that	1
Pierre	1
knew	1
this.	1
He	1
suddenly	1
muttered	1
something	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
Pierre	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
disconcerted.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
discomposure	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
touched	1
Pierre:	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Helene	1
and	1
she	1
too	1
seemed	1
disconcerted,	1
and	1
her	1
look	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
"Well,	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
own	1
fault."	1
	1
"The	1
step	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
but	1
I	1
cannot,	1
I	1
cannot!"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
began	1
speaking	1
about	1
indifferent	1
matters,	1
about	1
Sergey	1
Kuzmich,	1
asking	1
what	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
it	1
properly.	1
Helene	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
she	1
too	1
had	1
missed	1
it.	1
	1
When	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
the	1
princess,	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
talking	1
in	1
low	1
tones	1
to	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady	1
about	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Of	1
course,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
brilliant	1
match,	1
but	1
happiness,	1
my	1
dear..."	1
	1
"Marriages	1
are	1
made	1
in	1
heaven,"	1
replied	1
the	1
elderly	1
lady.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
passed	1
by,	1
seeming	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
ladies,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
sofa	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
dozing.	1
His	1
head	1
sank	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
roused	1
himself.	1
	1
"Aline,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
"go	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
about."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
passed	1
by	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
dignified	1
and	1
indifferent	1
air,	1
and	1
glanced	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room.	1
Pierre	1
and	1
Helene	1
still	1
sat	1
talking	1
just	1
as	1
before.	1
	1
"Still	1
the	1
same,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
frowned,	1
twisting	1
his	1
mouth,	1
his	1
cheeks	1
quivered	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
assumed	1
the	1
coarse,	1
unpleasant	1
expression	1
peculiar	1
to	1
him.	1
Shaking	1
himself,	1
he	1
rose,	1
threw	1
back	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
resolute	1
steps	1
went	1
past	1
the	1
ladies	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
drawing	1
room.	1
With	1
quick	1
steps	1
he	1
went	1
joyfully	1
up	1
to	1
Pierre.	1
His	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
unusually	1
triumphant	1
that	1
Pierre	1
rose	1
in	1
alarm	1
on	1
seeing	1
it.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"My	1
wife	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
everything!"	1
(He	1
put	1
one	1
arm	1
around	1
Pierre	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
around	1
his	1
daughter.)--"My	1
dear	1
boy...	1
Lelya...	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
pleased."	1
(His	1
voice	1
trembled.)	1
"I	1
loved	1
your	1
father...	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
good	1
wife...	1
God	1
bless	1
you!..."	1
	1
He	1
embraced	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
then	1
again	1
Pierre,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
malodorous	1
mouth.	1
Tears	1
actually	1
moistened	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
	1
"Princess,	1
come	1
here!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
princess	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
also	1
wept.	1
The	1
elderly	1
lady	1
was	1
using	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
too.	1
Pierre	1
was	1
kissed,	1
and	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Helene's	1
hand	1
several	1
times.	1
After	1
a	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
again.	1
	1
"All	1
this	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise,"	1
thought	1
Pierre,	1
"so	1
it	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
ask	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
because	1
it's	1
definite	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
tormenting	1
doubt."	1
Pierre	1
held	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
betrothed	1
in	1
silence,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
beautiful	1
bosom	1
as	1
it	1
rose	1
and	1
fell.	1
	1
"Helene!"	1
he	1
said	1
aloud	1
and	1
paused.	1
	1
"Something	1
special	1
is	1
always	1
said	1
in	1
such	1
cases,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
remember	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
people	1
say.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
face.	1
She	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
face	1
flushed.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
take	1
those	1
off...	1
those..."	1
she	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
spectacles.	1
	1
Pierre	1
took	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes,	1
besides	1
the	1
strange	1
look	1
eyes	1
have	1
from	1
which	1
spectacles	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
removed,	1
had	1
also	1
a	1
frightened	1
and	1
inquiring	1
look.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
stoop	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kiss	1
it,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
rapid,	1
almost	1
brutal	1
movement	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
she	1
intercepted	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
own.	1
Her	1
face	1
struck	1
Pierre,	1
by	1
its	1
altered,	1
unpleasantly	1
excited	1
expression.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
now,	1
it's	1
done;	1
besides	1
I	1
love	1
her,"	1
thought	1
Pierre.	1
	1
"Je	1
vous	1
aime!"	1
*	1
he	1
said,	1
remembering	1
what	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
at	1
such	1
moments:	1
but	1
his	1
words	1
sounded	1
so	1
weak	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
of	1
himself.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"I	1
love	1
you."	1
	1
Six	1
weeks	1
later	1
he	1
was	1
married,	1
and	1
settled	1
in	1
Count	1
Bezukhov's	1
large,	1
newly	1
furnished	1
Petersburg	1
house,	1
the	1
happy	1
possessor,	1
as	1
people	1
said,	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
celebrated	1
beauty	1
and	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
money.	1

CHAPTER	1
III	1
	1
Old	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
Bolkonski	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
November,	1
1805,	1
announcing	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
would	1
be	1
paying	1
him	1
a	1
visit.	1
"I	1
am	1
starting	1
on	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
inspection,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
nothing	1
of	1
an	1
extra	1
seventy	1
miles	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
my	1
honored	1
benefactor,"	1
wrote	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"My	1
son	1
Anatole	1
is	1
accompanying	1
me	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
army,	1
so	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
him	1
personally	1
to	1
express	1
the	1
deep	1
respect	1
that,	1
emulating	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
feels	1
for	1
you."	1
	1
"It	1
seems	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
bring	1
Mary	1
out,	1
suitors	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord,"	1
incautiously	1
remarked	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
Prince	1
Nicholas	1
frowned,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
A	1
fortnight	1
after	1
the	1
letter	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
servants	1
came	1
one	1
evening	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
arrived	1
next	1
day.	1
	1
Old	1
Bolkonski	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
character,	1
but	1
more	1
so	1
recently,	1
since	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
reigns	1
of	1
Paul	1
and	1
Alexander	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
risen	1
to	1
high	1
position	1
and	1
honors.	1
And	1
now,	1
from	1
the	1
hints	1
contained	1
in	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
he	1
saw	1
which	1
way	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
blowing,	1
and	1
his	1
low	1
opinion	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
contemptuous	1
ill	1
will.	1
He	1
snorted	1
whenever	1
he	1
mentioned	1
him.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arrival,	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
particularly	1
discontented	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
temper.	1
Whether	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
because	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
coming,	1
or	1
whether	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper	1
made	1
him	1
specially	1
annoyed	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
visit,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
temper,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
Tikhon	1
had	1
already	1
advised	1
the	1
architect	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
with	1
his	1
report.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
hear	1
how	1
he's	1
walking?"	1
said	1
Tikhon,	1
drawing	1
the	1
architect's	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
prince's	1
footsteps.	1
"Stepping	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
heels--we	1
know	1
what	1
that	1
means...."	1
	1
However,	1
at	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
the	1
prince,	1
in	1
his	1
velvet	1
coat	1
with	1
a	1
sable	1
collar	1
and	1
cap,	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
his	1
usual	1
walk.	1
It	1
had	1
snowed	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
and	1
the	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
hothouse,	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
walking,	1
had	1
been	1
swept:	1
the	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
broom	1
were	1
still	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
snow	1
and	1
a	1
shovel	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
sticking	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soft	1
snowbanks	1
that	1
bordered	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
path.	1
The	1
prince	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
conservatories,	1
the	1
serfs'	1
quarters,	1
and	1
the	1
outbuildings,	1
frowning	1
and	1
silent.	1
	1
"Can	1
a	1
sleigh	1
pass?"	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
overseer,	1
a	1
venerable	1
man,	1
resembling	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
manners	1
and	1
looks,	1
who	1
was	1
accompanying	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
"The	1
snow	1
is	1
deep.	1
I	1
am	1
having	1
the	1
avenue	1
swept,	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
porch.	1
"God	1
be	1
thanked,"	1
thought	1
the	1
overseer,	1
"the	1
storm	1
has	1
blown	1
over!"	1
	1
"It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
to	1
drive	1
up,	1
your	1
honor,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"I	1
heard,	1
your	1
honor,	1
that	1
a	1
minister	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
visit	1
your	1
honor."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
overseer	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
frowning.	1
	1
"What?	1
A	1
minister?	1
What	1
minister?	1
Who	1
gave	1
orders?"	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
shrill,	1
harsh	1
voice.	1
"The	1
road	1
is	1
not	1
swept	1
for	1
the	1
princess	1
my	1
daughter,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
minister!	1
For	1
me,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
ministers!"	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
I	1
thought..."	1
	1
"You	1
thought!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince,	1
his	1
words	1
coming	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
rapidly	1
and	1
indistinctly.	1
"You	1
thought!...	1
Rascals!	1
Blackguards!...	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
think!"	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
stick	1
he	1
swung	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
hit	1
Alpatych,	1
the	1
overseer,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
latter	1
instinctively	1
avoided	1
the	1
blow.	1
"Thought...	1
Blackguards..."	1
shouted	1
the	1
prince	1
rapidly.	1
	1
But	1
although	1
Alpatych,	1
frightened	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
temerity	1
in	1
avoiding	1
the	1
stroke,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prince,	1
bowing	1
his	1
bald	1
head	1
resignedly	1
before	1
him,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
very	1
reason,	1
the	1
prince,	1
though	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
shout:	1
"Blackguards!...	1
Throw	1
the	1
snow	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
road!"	1
did	1
not	1
lift	1
his	1
stick	1
again	1
but	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
Before	1
dinner,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor,	1
stood	1
awaiting	1
him;	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
with	1
a	1
radiant	1
face	1
that	1
said:	1
"I	1
know	1
nothing,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
usual,"	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
pale,	1
frightened,	1
and	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes.	1
What	1
she	1
found	1
hardest	1
to	1
bear	1
was	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
behave	1
like	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
but	1
could	1
not.	1
She	1
thought:	1
"If	1
I	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
notice	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
sympathize	1
with	1
him;	1
if	1
I	1
seem	1
sad	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
myself,	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
(as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
before)	1
that	1
I'm	1
in	1
the	1
dumps."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
daughter's	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
snorted.	1
	1
"Fool...	1
or	1
dummy!"	1
he	1
muttered.	1
	1
"And	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
is	1
not	1
here.	1
They've	1
been	1
telling	1
tales,"	1
he	1
thought-	1
-referring	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
dining	1
room.	1
	1
"Where	1
is	1
the	1
princess?"	1
he	1
asked.	1
"Hiding?"	1
	1
"She	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
well,"	1
answered	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
with	1
a	1
bright	1
smile,	1
"so	1
she	1
won't	1
come	1
down.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
in	1
her	1
state."	1
	1
"Hm!	1
Hm!"	1
muttered	1
the	1
prince,	1
sitting	1
down.	1
	1
His	1
plate	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
not	1
quite	1
clean,	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
a	1
spot	1
he	1
flung	1
it	1
away.	1
Tikhon	1
caught	1
it	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
footman.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
not	1
unwell,	1
but	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
overpowering	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that,	1
hearing	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
humor,	1
she	1
had	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
appear.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
for	1
the	1
baby,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne:	1
"Heaven	1
knows	1
what	1
a	1
fright	1
might	1
do."	1
	1
In	1
general	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
lived	1
in	1
constant	1
fear,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
antipathy	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
because	1
the	1
fear	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
stronger	1
feeling.	1
The	1
prince	1
reciprocated	1
this	1
antipathy,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
her.	1
When	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
grown	1
accustomed	1
to	1
life	1
at	1
Bald	1
Hills,	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
special	1
fancy	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
spent	1
whole	1
days	1
with	1
her,	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
and	1
often	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
and	1
criticized	1
him.	1
	1
"So	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
visitors,	1
mon	1
prince?"	1
remarked	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
unfolding	1
her	1
white	1
napkin	1
with	1
her	1
rosy	1
fingers.	1
"His	1
Excellency	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
Kuragin	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
I	1
understand?"	1
she	1
said	1
inquiringly.	1
	1
"Hm!--his	1
excellency	1
is	1
a	1
puppy....	1
I	1
got	1
him	1
his	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
service,"	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
disdainfully.	1
"Why	1
his	1
son	1
is	1
coming	1
I	1
don't	1
understand.	1
Perhaps	1
Princess	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
know.	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
him."	1
(He	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
blushing	1
daughter.)	1
"Are	1
you	1
unwell	1
today?	1
Eh?	1
Afraid	1
of	1
the	1
'minister'	1
as	1
that	1
idiot	1
Alpatych	1
called	1
him	1
this	1
morning?"	1
	1
"No,	1
mon	1
pere."	1
	1
Though	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
unsuccessful	1
in	1
her	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
subject,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
talking,	1
but	1
chattered	1
about	1
the	1
conservatories	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
flower	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
opened,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
soup	1
the	1
prince	1
became	1
more	1
genial.	1
	1
After	1
dinner,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
table,	1
chattering	1
with	1
Masha,	1
her	1
maid.	1
She	1
grew	1
pale	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
father-in-law.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
much	1
altered.	1
She	1
was	1
now	1
plain	1
rather	1
than	1
pretty.	1
Her	1
cheeks	1
had	1
sunk,	1
her	1
lip	1
was	1
drawn	1
up,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
drawn	1
down.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
oppression,"	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
prince's	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
she	1
felt.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
want	1
anything?"	1
	1
"No,	1
merci,	1
mon	1
pere."	1
	1
"Well,	1
all	1
right,	1
all	1
right."	1
	1
He	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
waiting	1
room	1
where	1
Alpatych	1
stood	1
with	1
bowed	1
head.	1
	1
"Has	1
the	1
snow	1
been	1
shoveled	1
back?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
heaven's	1
sake...	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
my	1
stupidity."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,"	1
interrupted	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
laughing	1
his	1
unnatural	1
way,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
Alpatych	1
to	1
kiss,	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
arrived	1
that	1
evening.	1
He	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
avenue	1
by	1
coachmen	1
and	1
footmen,	1
who,	1
with	1
loud	1
shouts,	1
dragged	1
his	1
sleighs	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
over	1
the	1
road	1
purposely	1
laden	1
with	1
snow.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
Anatole	1
had	1
separate	1
rooms	1
assigned	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
Anatole,	1
having	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
overcoat,	1
sat	1
with	1
arms	1
akimbo	1
before	1
a	1
table	1
on	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
smilingly	1
and	1
absent-mindedly	1
fixed	1
his	1
large	1
and	1
handsome	1
eyes.	1
He	1
regarded	1
his	1
whole	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
continual	1
round	1
of	1
amusement	1
which	1
someone	1
for	1
some	1
reason	1
had	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
churlish	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
ugly	1
heiress	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
All	1
this	1
might,	1
he	1
thought,	1
turn	1
out	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
amusingly.	1
"And	1
why	1
not	1
marry	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
really	1
has	1
so	1
much	1
money?	1
That	1
never	1
does	1
any	1
harm,"	1
thought	1
Anatole.	1
	1
He	1
shaved	1
and	1
scented	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
elegance	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
habitual	1
to	1
him	1
and,	1
his	1
handsome	1
head	1
held	1
high,	1
entered	1
his	1
father's	1
room	1
with	1
the	1
good-humored	1
and	1
victorious	1
air	1
natural	1
to	1
him.	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
two	1
valets	1
were	1
busy	1
dressing	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
much	1
animation	1
and	1
cheerfully	1
nodded	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
entered,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"Yes,	1
that's	1
how	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
look."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Father,	1
joking	1
apart,	1
is	1
she	1
very	1
hideous?"	1
Anatole	1
asked,	1
as	1
if	1
continuing	1
a	1
conversation	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
mentioned	1
during	1
the	1
journey.	1
	1
"Enough!	1
What	1
nonsense!	1
Above	1
all,	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
respectful	1
and	1
cautious	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
prince."	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
starts	1
a	1
row	1
I'll	1
go	1
away,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Anatole.	1
"I	1
can't	1
bear	1
those	1
old	1
men!	1
Eh?"	1
	1
"Remember,	1
for	1
you	1
everything	1
depends	1
on	1
this."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
not	1
only	1
was	1
it	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
maidservants'	1
rooms	1
that	1
the	1
minister	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
arrived,	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
both	1
had	1
been	1
minutely	1
described.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
alone	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
vainly	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
her	1
agitation.	1
	1
"Why	1
did	1
they	1
write,	1
why	1
did	1
Lise	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
it?	1
It	1
can	1
never	1
happen!"	1
she	1
said,	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
"How	1
shall	1
I	1
enter	1
the	1
drawing	1
room?	1
Even	1
if	1
I	1
like	1
him	1
I	1
can't	1
now	1
be	1
myself	1
with	1
him."	1
The	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
look	1
filled	1
her	1
with	1
terror.	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
already	1
received	1
from	1
Masha,	1
the	1
lady's	1
maid,	1
the	1
necessary	1
report	1
of	1
how	1
handsome	1
the	1
minister's	1
son	1
was,	1
with	1
his	1
rosy	1
cheeks	1
and	1
dark	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
difficulty	1
the	1
father	1
had	1
dragged	1
his	1
legs	1
upstairs	1
while	1
the	1
son	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
eagle,	1
three	1
steps	1
at	1
a	1
time.	1
Having	1
received	1
this	1
information,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
whose	1
chattering	1
voices	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
corridor,	1
went	1
into	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
know	1
they've	1
come,	1
Marie?"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
waddling	1
in,	1
and	1
sinking	1
heavily	1
into	1
an	1
armchair.	1
	1
She	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
loose	1
gown	1
she	1
generally	1
wore	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
but	1
had	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
best	1
dresses.	1
Her	1
hair	1
was	1
carefully	1
done	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
animated,	1
which,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
conceal	1
its	1
sunken	1
and	1
faded	1
outlines.	1
Dressed	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Petersburg	1
society,	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
noticeable	1
how	1
much	1
plainer	1
she	1
had	1
become.	1
Some	1
unobtrusive	1
touch	1
had	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
toilet	1
which	1
rendered	1
her	1
fresh	1
and	1
pretty	1
face	1
yet	1
more	1
attractive.	1
	1
"What!	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
remain	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
dear	1
princess?"	1
she	1
began.	1
"They'll	1
be	1
announcing	1
that	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
smartened	1
yourself	1
up	1
at	1
all!"	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
got	1
up,	1
rang	1
for	1
the	1
maid,	1
and	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
merrily	1
began	1
to	1
devise	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
how	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
should	1
be	1
dressed.	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
self-esteem	1
was	1
wounded	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
suitor	1
agitated	1
her,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
by	1
both	1
her	1
companions'	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
least	1
conception	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
otherwise.	1
To	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
ashamed	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
for	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
betray	1
her	1
agitation,	1
while	1
to	1
decline	1
their	1
offers	1
to	1
dress	1
her	1
would	1
prolong	1
their	1
banter	1
and	1
insistence.	1
She	1
flushed,	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
grew	1
dim,	1
red	1
blotches	1
came	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
it	1
took	1
on	1
the	1
unattractive	1
martyrlike	1
expression	1
it	1
so	1
often	1
wore,	1
as	1
she	1
submitted	1
herself	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
Lise.	1
Both	1
these	1
women	1
quite	1
sincerely	1
tried	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
look	1
pretty.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
plain	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
rival,	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
dressing	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
sincerity,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
naive	1
and	1
firm	1
conviction	1
women	1
have	1
that	1
dress	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
face	1
pretty.	1
	1
"No	1
really,	1
my	1
dear,	1
this	1
dress	1
is	1
not	1
pretty,"	1
said	1
Lise,	1
looking	1
sideways	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
from	1
a	1
little	1
distance.	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress,	1
have	1
it	1
fetched.	1
Really!	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
your	1
whole	1
life	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
stake.	1
But	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
too	1
light,	1
it's	1
not	1
becoming!"	1
	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
dress,	1
but	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
whole	1
figure	1
of	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
pretty,	1
but	1
neither	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
nor	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
felt	1
this;	1
they	1
still	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
blue	1
ribbon	1
were	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hair,	1
the	1
hair	1
combed	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
blue	1
scarf	1
arranged	1
lower	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
maroon	1
dress,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
well.	1
They	1
forgot	1
that	1
the	1
frightened	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
altered,	1
and	1
that	1
however	1
they	1
might	1
change	1
the	1
setting	1
and	1
adornment	1
of	1
that	1
face,	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
piteous	1
and	1
plain.	1
After	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
changes	1
to	1
which	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
meekly	1
submitted,	1
just	1
as	1
her	1
hair	1
had	1
been	1
arranged	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
head	1
(a	1
style	1
that	1
quite	1
altered	1
and	1
spoiled	1
her	1
looks)	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
maroon	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
pale-blue	1
scarf,	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
walked	1
twice	1
round	1
her,	1
now	1
adjusting	1
a	1
fold	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
with	1
her	1
little	1
hand,	1
now	1
arranging	1
the	1
scarf	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
bent	1
first	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
"No,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do,"	1
she	1
said	1
decidedly,	1
clasping	1
her	1
hands.	1
"No,	1
Mary,	1
really	1
this	1
dress	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
you.	1
I	1
prefer	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
little	1
gray	1
everyday	1
dress.	1
Now	1
please,	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
Katie,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
maid,	1
"bring	1
the	1
princess	1
her	1
gray	1
dress,	1
and	1
you'll	1
see,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
how	1
I	1
shall	1
arrange	1
it,"	1
she	1
added,	1
smiling	1
with	1
a	1
foretaste	1
of	1
artistic	1
pleasure.	1
	1
But	1
when	1
Katie	1
brought	1
the	1
required	1
dress,	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
remained	1
sitting	1
motionless	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
her	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
her	1
mouth	1
quivering,	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
sobs.	1
	1
"Come,	1
dear	1
princess,"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
"just	1
one	1
more	1
little	1
effort."	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
taking	1
the	1
dress	1
from	1
the	1
maid,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"Well,	1
now	1
we'll	1
arrange	1
something	1
quite	1
simple	1
and	1
becoming,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
The	1
three	1
voices,	1
hers,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's,	1
and	1
Katie's,	1
who	1
was	1
laughing	1
at	1
something,	1
mingled	1
in	1
a	1
merry	1
sound,	1
like	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
"No,	1
leave	1
me	1
alone,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
Her	1
voice	1
sounded	1
so	1
serious	1
and	1
so	1
sad	1
that	1
the	1
chirping	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
was	1
silenced	1
at	1
once.	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
beautiful,	1
large,	1
thoughtful	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
and	1
of	1
thoughts,	1
gazing	1
shiningly	1
and	1
imploringly	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
understood	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
and	1
even	1
cruel	1
to	1
insist.	1
	1
"At	1
least,	1
change	1
your	1
coiffure,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess.	1
"Didn't	1
I	1
tell	1
you,"	1
she	1
went	1
on,	1
turning	1
reproachfully	1
to	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
"Mary's	1
is	1
a	1
face	1
which	1
such	1
a	1
coiffure	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Not	1
in	1
the	1
least!	1
Please	1
change	1
it."	1
	1
"Leave	1
me	1
alone,	1
please	1
leave	1
me	1
alone!	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
quite	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me,"	1
answered	1
a	1
voice	1
struggling	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
had	1
to	1
own	1
to	1
themselves	1
that	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
in	1
this	1
guise	1
looked	1
very	1
plain,	1
worse	1
than	1
usual,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
She	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
they	1
both	1
knew,	1
an	1
expression	1
thoughtful	1
and	1
sad.	1
This	1
expression	1
in	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
did	1
not	1
frighten	1
them	1
(she	1
never	1
inspired	1
fear	1
in	1
anyone),	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
she	1
became	1
mute	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken	1
in	1
her	1
determination.	1
	1
"You	1
will	1
change	1
it,	1
won't	1
you?"	1
said	1
Lise.	1
And	1
as	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
gave	1
no	1
answer,	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
left	1
alone.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
comply	1
with	1
Lise's	1
request,	1
she	1
not	1
only	1
left	1
her	1
hair	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
glass.	1
Letting	1
her	1
arms	1
fall	1
helplessly,	1
she	1
sat	1
with	1
downcast	1
eyes	1
and	1
pondered.	1
A	1
husband,	1
a	1
man,	1
a	1
strong	1
dominant	1
and	1
strangely	1
attractive	1
being	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
imagination,	1
and	1
carried	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
totally	1
different	1
happy	1
world	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
She	1
fancied	1
a	1
child,	1
her	1
own--such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
nurse's	1
daughter--at	1
her	1
own	1
breast,	1
the	1
husband	1
standing	1
by	1
and	1
gazing	1
tenderly	1
at	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
child.	1
"But	1
no,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
ugly,"	1
she	1
thought.	1
	1
"Please	1
come	1
to	1
tea.	1
The	1
prince	1
will	1
be	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
moment,"	1
came	1
the	1
maid's	1
voice	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
She	1
roused	1
herself,	1
and	1
felt	1
appalled	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking,	1
and	1
before	1
going	1
down	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
icons	1
hung	1
and,	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
icon	1
of	1
the	1
Saviour	1
lit	1
by	1
a	1
lamp,	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
it	1
with	1
folded	1
hands	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
A	1
painful	1
doubt	1
filled	1
her	1
soul.	1
Could	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
love,	1
of	1
earthly	1
love	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
be	1
for	1
her?	1
In	1
her	1
thoughts	1
of	1
marriage	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
dreamed	1
of	1
happiness	1
and	1
of	1
children,	1
but	1
her	1
strongest,	1
most	1
deeply	1
hidden	1
longing	1
was	1
for	1
earthly	1
love.	1
The	1
more	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
this	1
feeling	1
from	1
others	1
and	1
even	1
from	1
herself,	1
the	1
stronger	1
it	1
grew.	1
"O	1
God,"	1
she	1
said,	1
"how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
stifle	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
these	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil?	1
How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
renounce	1
forever	1
these	1
vile	1
fancies,	1
so	1
as	1
peacefully	1
to	1
fulfill	1
Thy	1
will?"	1
And	1
scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
put	1
that	1
question	1
than	1
God	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
answer	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
heart.	1
"Desire	1
nothing	1
for	1
thyself,	1
seek	1
nothing,	1
be	1
not	1
anxious	1
or	1
envious.	1
Man's	1
future	1
and	1
thy	1
own	1
fate	1
must	1
remain	1
hidden	1
from	1
thee,	1
but	1
live	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
ready	1
for	1
anything.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
God's	1
will	1
to	1
prove	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
marriage,	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
fulfill	1
His	1
will."	1
With	1
this	1
consoling	1
thought	1
(but	1
yet	1
with	1
a	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
her	1
forbidden	1
earthly	1
longing)	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
sighed,	1
and	1
having	1
crossed	1
herself	1
went	1
down,	1
thinking	1
neither	1
of	1
her	1
gown	1
and	1
coiffure	1
nor	1
of	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
in	1
nor	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
say.	1
What	1
could	1
all	1
that	1
matter	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
without	1
Whose	1
care	1
not	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
man's	1
head	1
can	1
fall?	1

CHAPTER	1
IV	1
	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
came	1
down,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
already	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
When	1
she	1
entered	1
with	1
her	1
heavy	1
step,	1
treading	1
on	1
her	1
heels,	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
rose	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
indicating	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
gentlemen,	1
said:	1
"Voila	1
Marie!"	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
saw	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
in	1
detail.	1
She	1
saw	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
face,	1
serious	1
for	1
an	1
instant	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
immediately	1
smiling	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
curiously	1
noting	1
the	1
impression	1
"Marie"	1
produced	1
on	1
the	1
visitors.	1
And	1
she	1
saw	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
with	1
her	1
ribbon	1
and	1
pretty	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
unusually	1
animated	1
look	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
him	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see,	1
she	1
only	1
saw	1
something	1
large,	1
brilliant,	1
and	1
handsome	1
moving	1
toward	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
approached	1
first,	1
and	1
she	1
kissed	1
the	1
bold	1
forehead	1
that	1
bent	1
over	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
answered	1
his	1
question	1
by	1
saying	1
that,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
remembered	1
him	1
quite	1
well.	1
Then	1
Anatole	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
still	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him.	1
She	1
only	1
felt	1
a	1
soft	1
hand	1
taking	1
hers	1
firmly,	1
and	1
she	1
touched	1
with	1
her	1
lips	1
a	1
white	1
forehead,	1
over	1
which	1
was	1
beautiful	1
light-	1
brown	1
hair	1
smelling	1
of	1
pomade.	1
When	1
she	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
beauty.	1
Anatole	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
thumb	1
under	1
a	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
uniform,	1
his	1
chest	1
expanded	1
and	1
his	1
back	1
drawn	1
in,	1
slightly	1
swinging	1
one	1
foot,	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
bent,	1
looked	1
with	1
beaming	1
face	1
at	1
the	1
princess	1
without	1
speaking	1
and	1
evidently	1
not	1
thinking	1
about	1
her	1
at	1
all.	1
Anatole	1
was	1
not	1
quick-witted,	1
nor	1
ready	1
or	1
eloquent	1
in	1
conversation,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
faculty,	1
so	1
invaluable	1
in	1
society,	1
of	1
composure	1
and	1
imperturbable	1
self-possession.	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
lacking	1
in	1
self-confidence	1
remains	1
dumb	1
on	1
a	1
first	1
introduction	1
and	1
betrays	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
such	1
silence	1
and	1
an	1
anxiety	1
to	1
find	1
something	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
effect	1
is	1
bad.	1
But	1
Anatole	1
was	1
dumb,	1
swung	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
smilingly	1
examined	1
the	1
princess'	1
hair.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
silent	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time.	1
"If	1
anyone	1
finds	1
this	1
silence	1
inconvenient,	1
let	1
him	1
talk,	1
but	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to,"	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
in	1
his	1
behavior	1
to	1
women	1
Anatole	1
had	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
particularly	1
inspires	1
in	1
them	1
curiosity,	1
awe,	1
and	1
even	1
love--a	1
supercilious	1
consciousness	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
superiority.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them:	1
"I	1
know	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
but	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
bother	1
about	1
you?	1
You'd	1
be	1
only	1
too	1
glad,	1
of	1
course."	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
think	1
this	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
women--even	1
probably	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
for	1
in	1
general	1
he	1
thought	1
very	1
little--but	1
his	1
looks	1
and	1
manner	1
gave	1
that	1
impression.	1
The	1
princess	1
felt	1
this,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
dare	1
expect	1
to	1
interest	1
him,	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
The	1
conversation	1
was	1
general	1
and	1
animated,	1
thanks	1
to	1
Princess	1
Lise's	1
voice	1
and	1
little	1
downy	1
lip	1
that	1
lifted	1
over	1
her	1
white	1
teeth.	1
She	1
met	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
with	1
that	1
playful	1
manner	1
often	1
employed	1
by	1
lively	1
chatty	1
people,	1
and	1
consisting	1
in	1
the	1
assumption	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
so	1
address	1
and	1
themselves	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
semi-private,	1
long-established	1
jokes	1
and	1
amusing	1
reminiscences,	1
though	1
no	1
such	1
reminiscences	1
really	1
exist--just	1
as	1
none	1
existed	1
in	1
this	1
case.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
readily	1
adopted	1
her	1
tone	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
also	1
drew	1
Anatole,	1
whom	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew,	1
into	1
these	1
amusing	1
recollections	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
occurred.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
also	1
shared	1
them	1
and	1
even	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
herself	1
pleasantly	1
made	1
to	1
share	1
in	1
these	1
merry	1
reminiscences.	1
	1
"Here	1
at	1
least	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
your	1
company	1
all	1
to	1
ourselves,	1
dear	1
prince,"	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
(of	1
course,	1
in	1
French)	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
"It's	1
not	1
as	1
at	1
Annette's	1
*	1
receptions	1
where	1
you	1
always	1
ran	1
away;	1
you	1
remember	1
cette	1
chere	1
Annette!"	1
	1
	1
*	1
Anna	1
Pavlovna.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
but	1
you	1
won't	1
talk	1
politics	1
to	1
me	1
like	1
Annette!"	1
	1
"And	1
our	1
little	1
tea	1
table?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
yes!"	1
	1
"Why	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
were	1
never	1
at	1
Annette's?"	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
asked	1
Anatole.	1
"Ah,	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
know,"	1
she	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
sly	1
glance,	1
"your	1
brother	1
Hippolyte	1
told	1
me	1
about	1
your	1
goings	1
on.	1
Oh!"	1
and	1
she	1
shook	1
her	1
finger	1
at	1
him,	1
"I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
doings	1
in	1
Paris!"	1
	1
"And	1
didn't	1
Hippolyte	1
tell	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
arm	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
run	1
away	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
managed	1
to	1
catch	1
her,	1
"didn't	1
he	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
pining	1
for	1
the	1
dear	1
princess,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
door?	1
Oh,	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
pearl	1
among	1
women,	1
Princess,"	1
he	1
added,	1
turning	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
When	1
Paris	1
was	1
mentioned,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
for	1
her	1
part	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
current	1
of	1
recollections.	1
	1
She	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
inquiring	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
Anatole	1
had	1
left	1
Paris	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
liked	1
that	1
city.	1
Anatole	1
answered	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
very	1
readily	1
and,	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
her	1
native	1
land.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
pretty	1
little	1
Bourienne,	1
Anatole	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
find	1
Bald	1
Hills	1
dull	1
either.	1
"Not	1
at	1
all	1
bad!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
examining	1
her,	1
"not	1
at	1
all	1
bad,	1
that	1
little	1
companion!	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
will	1
bring	1
her	1
along	1
with	1
her	1
when	1
we're	1
married,	1
la	1
petite	1
est	1
gentille."	1
*	1
	1

The	1
little	1
one	1
is	1
charming.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
dressed	1
leisurely	1
in	1
his	1
study,	1
frowning	1
and	1
considering	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
coming	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
annoyed	1
him.	1
"What	1
are	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
to	1
me?	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
is	1
a	1
shallow	1
braggart	1
and	1
his	1
son,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
specimen,"	1
he	1
grumbled	1
to	1
himself.	1
What	1
angered	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
these	1
visitors	1
revived	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
an	1
unsettled	1
question	1
he	1
always	1
tried	1
to	1
stifle,	1
one	1
about	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
deceived	1
himself.	1
The	1
question	1
was	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
ever	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
husband.	1
The	1
prince	1
never	1
directly	1
asked	1
himself	1
that	1
question,	1
knowing	1
beforehand	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
answer	1
it	1
justly,	1
and	1
justice	1
clashed	1
not	1
only	1
with	1
his	1
feelings	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
possibility	1
of	1
life.	1
Life	1
without	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
value	1
her,	1
was	1
unthinkable	1
to	1
him.	1
"And	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
marry?"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"To	1
be	1
unhappy	1
for	1
certain.	1
There's	1
Lise,	1
married	1
to	1
Andrew--a	1
better	1
husband	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
could	1
hardly	1
be	1
found	1
nowadays--but	1
is	1
she	1
contented	1
with	1
her	1
lot?	1
And	1
who	1
would	1
marry	1
Marie	1
for	1
love?	1
Plain	1
and	1
awkward!	1
They'll	1
take	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
connections	1
and	1
wealth.	1
Are	1
there	1
no	1
women	1
living	1
unmarried,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
happier	1
for	1
it?"	1
So	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
while	1
dressing,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
putting	1
off	1
demanded	1
an	1
immediate	1
answer.	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
had	1
brought	1
his	1
son	1
with	1
the	1
evident	1
intention	1
of	1
proposing,	1
and	1
today	1
or	1
tomorrow	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
ask	1
for	1
an	1
answer.	1
His	1
birth	1
and	1
position	1
in	1
society	1
were	1
not	1
bad.	1
"Well,	1
I've	1
nothing	1
against	1
it,"	1
the	1
prince	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
"but	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see."	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see!	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
see!"	1
he	1
added	1
aloud.	1
	1
He	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing	1
room	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
alert	1
step,	1
glancing	1
rapidly	1
round	1
the	1
company.	1
He	1
noticed	1
the	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
dress,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
ribbon,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
unbecoming	1
coiffure,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
and	1
Anatole's	1
smiles,	1
and	1
the	1
loneliness	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
amid	1
the	1
general	1
conversation.	1
"Got	1
herself	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
fool!"	1
he	1
thought,	1
looking	1
irritably	1
at	1
her.	1
"She	1
is	1
shameless,	1
and	1
he	1
ignores	1
her!"	1
	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Well!	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
How	1
d'ye	1
do?	1
Glad	1
to	1
see	1
you!"	1
	1
"Friendship	1
laughs	1
at	1
distance,"	1
began	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
rapid,	1
self-confident,	1
familiar	1
tone.	1
"Here	1
is	1
my	1
second	1
son;	1
please	1
love	1
and	1
befriend	1
him."	1
	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
surveyed	1
Anatole.	1
	1
"Fine	1
young	1
fellow!	1
Fine	1
young	1
fellow!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Well,	1
come	1
and	1
kiss	1
me,"	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
his	1
cheek.	1
	1
Anatole	1
kissed	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
curiosity	1
and	1
perfect	1
composure,	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
display	1
of	1
the	1
eccentricities	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
expect.	1
	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
sofa	1
and,	1
drawing	1
up	1
an	1
armchair	1
for	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
pointed	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
began	1
questioning	1
him	1
about	1
political	1
affairs	1
and	1
news.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen	1
attentively	1
to	1
what	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
said,	1
but	1
kept	1
glancing	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
they	1
are	1
writing	1
from	1
Potsdam	1
already?"	1
he	1
said,	1
repeating	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
last	1
words.	1
Then	1
rising,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
daughter.	1
	1
"Is	1
it	1
for	1
visitors	1
you've	1
got	1
yourself	1
up	1
like	1
that,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Fine,	1
very	1
fine!	1
You	1
have	1
done	1
up	1
your	1
hair	1
in	1
this	1
new	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
visitors,	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
visitors	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
in	1
future	1
you	1
are	1
never	1
to	1
dare	1
to	1
change	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
dress	1
without	1
my	1
consent."	1
	1
"It	1
was	1
my	1
fault,	1
mon	1
pere,"	1
interceded	1
the	1
little	1
princess,	1
with	1
a	1
blush.	1
	1
"You	1
must	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
bowing	1
to	1
his	1
daughter-in-law,	1
"but	1
she	1
need	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
herself,	1
she's	1
plain	1
enough	1
as	1
it	1
is."	1
	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
again,	1
paying	1
no	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
who	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
tears.	1
	1
"On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
coiffure	1
suits	1
the	1
princess	1
very	1
well,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"Now	1
you,	1
young	1
prince,	1
what's	1
your	1
name?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
to	1
Anatole,	1
"come	1
here,	1
let	1
us	1
talk	1
and	1
get	1
acquainted."	1
	1
"Now	1
the	1
fun	1
begins,"	1
thought	1
Anatole,	1
sitting	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
beside	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
I	1
hear	1
you've	1
been	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
not	1
taught	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
by	1
the	1
deacon,	1
like	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
me.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
are	1
you	1
serving	1
in	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards?"	1
asked	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
scrutinizing	1
Anatole	1
closely	1
and	1
intently.	1
	1
"No,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
line,"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter.	1
	1
"Ah!	1
That's	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
So,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
country?	1
It	1
is	1
wartime.	1
Such	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow	1
must	1
serve.	1
Well,	1
are	1
you	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
front?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Prince,	1
our	1
regiment	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
attached...	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
I	1
am	1
attached	1
to,	1
Papa?"	1
said	1
Anatole,	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
laugh.	1
	1
"A	1
splendid	1
soldier,	1
splendid!	1
'What	1
am	1
I	1
attached	1
to!'	1
Ha,	1
ha,	1
ha!"	1
laughed	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
and	1
Anatole	1
laughed	1
still	1
louder.	1
Suddenly	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
frowned.	1
	1
"You	1
may	1
go,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Anatole	1
returned	1
smiling	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
	1
"And	1
so	1
you've	1
had	1
him	1
educated	1
abroad,	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
haven't	1
you?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
done	1
my	1
best	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
the	1
education	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
ours."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
everything	1
is	1
different	1
nowadays,	1
everything	1
is	1
changed.	1
The	1
lad's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow,	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow!	1
Well,	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
now."	1
He	1
took	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
arm	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
study.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
together,	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
announced	1
his	1
hopes	1
and	1
wishes	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
	1
"Well,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
prevent	1
her,	1
that	1
I	1
can't	1
part	1
from	1
her?"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince	1
angrily.	1
"What	1
an	1
idea!	1
I'm	1
ready	1
for	1
it	1
tomorrow!	1
Only	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
son-in-law	1
better.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
principles--everything	1
aboveboard?	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
her	1
tomorrow	1
in	1
your	1
presence;	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
willing,	1
then	1
he	1
can	1
stay	1
on.	1
He	1
can	1
stay	1
and	1
I'll	1
see."	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
snorted.	1
"Let	1
her	1
marry,	1
it's	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me!"	1
he	1
screamed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
piercing	1
tone	1
as	1
when	1
parting	1
from	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
frankly,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
in	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
crafty	1
man	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
being	1
cunning	1
with	1
so	1
keen-sighted	1
a	1
companion.	1
"You	1
know,	1
you	1
see	1
right	1
through	1
people.	1
Anatole	1
is	1
no	1
genius,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
honest,	1
goodhearted	1
lad;	1
an	1
excellent	1
son	1
or	1
kinsman."	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right,	1
we'll	1
see!"	1
	1
As	1
always	1
happens	1
when	1
women	1
lead	1
lonely	1
lives	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
without	1
male	1
society,	1
on	1
Anatole's	1
appearance	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
women	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski's	1
household	1
felt	1
that	1
their	1
life	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
real	1
till	1
then.	1
Their	1
powers	1
of	1
reasoning,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
observing	1
immediately	1
increased	1
tenfold,	1
and	1
their	1
life,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
darkness,	1
was	1
suddenly	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
brightness,	1
full	1
of	1
significance.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
grew	1
quite	1
unconscious	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
coiffure.	1
The	1
handsome	1
open	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
absorbed	1
all	1
her	1
attention.	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
kind,	1
brave,	1
determined,	1
manly,	1
and	1
magnanimous.	1
She	1
felt	1
convinced	1
of	1
that.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
dreams	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
family	1
life	1
continually	1
rose	1
in	1
her	1
imagination.	1
She	1
drove	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal	1
them.	1
	1
"But	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
too	1
cold	1
with	1
him?"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
"I	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
feel	1
too	1
near	1
to	1
him	1
already,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
may	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
him."	1
	1
And	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
tried,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
manage,	1
to	1
be	1
cordial	1
to	1
her	1
new	1
guest.	1
"Poor	1
girl,	1
she's	1
devilish	1
ugly!"	1
thought	1
Anatole.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
also	1
roused	1
to	1
great	1
excitement	1
by	1
Anatole's	1
arrival,	1
thought	1
in	1
another	1
way.	1
Of	1
course,	1
she,	1
a	1
handsome	1
young	1
woman	1
without	1
any	1
definite	1
position,	1
without	1
relations	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
country,	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
devote	1
her	1
life	1
to	1
serving	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
to	1
reading	1
aloud	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
being	1
friends	1
with	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince	1
who,	1
able	1
to	1
appreciate	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
her	1
superiority	1
to	1
the	1
plain,	1
badly	1
dressed,	1
ungainly	1
Russian	1
princesses,	1
would	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
carry	1
her	1
off;	1
and	1
here	1
at	1
last	1
was	1
a	1
Russian	1
prince.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
knew	1
a	1
story,	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
aunt	1
but	1
finished	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
way,	1
which	1
she	1
liked	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
herself.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
seduced,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
her	1
poor	1
mother	1
(sa	1
pauvre	1
mere)	1
appeared,	1
and	1
reproached	1
her	1
for	1
yielding	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
being	1
married.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
often	1
touched	1
to	1
tears	1
as	1
in	1
imagination	1
she	1
told	1
this	1
story	1
to	1
him,	1
her	1
seducer.	1
And	1
now	1
he,	1
a	1
real	1
Russian	1
prince,	1
had	1
appeared.	1
He	1
would	1
carry	1
her	1
away	1
and	1
then	1
sa	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
would	1
appear	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
marry	1
her.	1
So	1
her	1
future	1
shaped	1
itself	1
in	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
head	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Anatole	1
about	1
Paris.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
calculation	1
that	1
guided	1
her	1
(she	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
consider	1
what	1
she	1
should	1
do),	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
familiar	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
Anatole	1
had	1
appeared	1
it	1
just	1
grouped	1
itself	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
she	1
wished	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
war	1
horse	1
that	1
hears	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
unconsciously	1
and	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
her	1
condition,	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
familiar	1
gallop	1
of	1
coquetry,	1
without	1
any	1
ulterior	1
motive	1
or	1
any	1
struggle,	1
but	1
with	1
naive	1
and	1
lighthearted	1
gaiety.	1
	1
Although	1
in	1
female	1
society	1
Anatole	1
usually	1
assumed	1
the	1
role	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
tired	1
of	1
being	1
run	1
after	1
by	1
women,	1
his	1
vanity	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
the	1
spectacle	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
over	1
these	1
three	1
women.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
feel	1
for	1
the	1
pretty	1
and	1
provocative	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
that	1
passionate	1
animal	1
feeling	1
which	1
was	1
apt	1
to	1
master	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
suddenness	1
and	1
prompt	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
coarsest	1
and	1
most	1
reckless	1
actions.	1
	1
After	1
tea,	1
the	1
company	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sitting	1
room	1
and	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
Anatole,	1
laughing	1
and	1
in	1
high	1
spirits,	1
came	1
and	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
elbows,	1
facing	1
her	1
and	1
beside	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
felt	1
his	1
look	1
with	1
a	1
painfully	1
joyous	1
emotion.	1
Her	1
favorite	1
sonata	1
bore	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
most	1
intimately	1
poetic	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
she	1
felt	1
upon	1
her	1
made	1
that	1
world	1
still	1
more	1
poetic.	1
But	1
Anatole's	1
expression,	1
though	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her,	1
referred	1
not	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
little	1
foot,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
then	1
touching	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
under	1
the	1
clavichord.	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
also	1
looking	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
lovely	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
fearful	1
joy	1
and	1
hope	1
that	1
was	1
also	1
new	1
to	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"How	1
she	1
loves	1
me!"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"How	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
husband!	1
Husband?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
possible?"	1
she	1
thought,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
face,	1
but	1
still	1
feeling	1
his	1
eyes	1
gazing	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
evening,	1
after	1
supper,	1
when	1
all	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
retire,	1
Anatole	1
kissed	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
hand.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
courage,	1
but	1
she	1
looked	1
straight	1
into	1
his	1
handsome	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
shortsighted	1
eyes.	1
Turning	1
from	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
and	1
kissed	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
hand.	1
(This	1
was	1
not	1
etiquette,	1
but	1
then	1
he	1
did	1
everything	1
so	1
simply	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
assurance!)	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
flushed,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
princess	1
a	1
frightened	1
look.	1
	1
"What	1
delicacy!"	1
thought	1
the	1
princess.	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
Amelie"	1
(Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne)	1
"thinks	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
not	1
value	1
her	1
pure	1
affection	1
and	1
devotion	1
to	1
me?"	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
warmly.	1
Anatole	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
little	1
princess'	1
hand.	1
	1
"No!	1
No!	1
No!	1
When	1
your	1
father	1
writes	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
well	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss.	1
Not	1
till	1
then!"	1
she	1
said.	1
And	1
smilingly	1
raising	1
a	1
finger	1
at	1
him,	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
V	1
	1
They	1
all	1
separated,	1
but,	1
except	1
Anatole	1
who	1
fell	1
asleep	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
all	1
kept	1
awake	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
night.	1
	1
"Is	1
he	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
husband,	1
this	1
stranger	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
kind--yes,	1
kind,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
thing,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary;	1
and	1
fear,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
seldom	1
experienced,	1
came	1
upon	1
her.	1
She	1
feared	1
to	1
look	1
round,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
there	1
standing	1
behind	1
the	1
screen	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
corner.	1
And	1
this	1
someone	1
was	1
he--the	1
devil--and	1
he	1
was	1
also	1
this	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
forehead,	1
black	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
red	1
lips.	1
	1
She	1
rang	1
for	1
her	1
maid	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
her	1
room.	1
	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
conservatory	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
evening,	1
vainly	1
expecting	1
someone,	1
now	1
smiling	1
at	1
someone,	1
now	1
working	1
herself	1
up	1
to	1
tears	1
with	1
the	1
imaginary	1
words	1
of	1
her	1
pauvre	1
mere	1
rebuking	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
fall.	1
	1
The	1
little	1
princess	1
grumbled	1
to	1
her	1
maid	1
that	1
her	1
bed	1
was	1
badly	1
made.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
lie	1
either	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
or	1
on	1
her	1
side.	1
Every	1
position	1
was	1
awkward	1
and	1
uncomfortable,	1
and	1
her	1
burden	1
oppressed	1
her	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
because	1
Anatole's	1
presence	1
had	1
vividly	1
recalled	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
and	1
when	1
everything	1
was	1
light	1
and	1
gay.	1
She	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
armchair	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
jacket	1
and	1
nightcap	1
and	1
Katie,	1
sleepy	1
and	1
disheveled,	1
beat	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
heavy	1
feather	1
bed	1
for	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
muttering	1
to	1
herself.	1
	1
"I	1
told	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
lumps	1
and	1
holes!"	1
the	1
little	1
princess	1
repeated.	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
enough	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep,	1
so	1
it's	1
not	1
my	1
fault!"	1
and	1
her	1
voice	1
quivered	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
about	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
either.	1
Tikhon,	1
half	1
asleep,	1
heard	1
him	1
pacing	1
angrily	1
about	1
and	1
snorting.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
insulted	1
through	1
his	1
daughter.	1
The	1
insult	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
pointed	1
because	1
it	1
concerned	1
not	1
himself	1
but	1
another,	1
his	1
daughter,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
more	1
than	1
himself.	1
He	1
kept	1
telling	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
consider	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
and	1
decide	1
what	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
should	1
act,	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
excited	1
himself	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
	1
"The	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
turns	1
up--she	1
forgets	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
everything	1
else,	1
runs	1
upstairs	1
and	1
does	1
up	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
wags	1
her	1
tail	1
and	1
is	1
unlike	1
herself!	1
Glad	1
to	1
throw	1
her	1
father	1
over!	1
And	1
she	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
notice	1
it.	1
Fr...	1
fr...	1
fr!	1
And	1
don't	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
that	1
idiot	1
had	1
eyes	1
only	1
for	1
Bourienne--I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
her.	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
pride	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
it?	1
If	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
pride	1
for	1
herself	1
she	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
some	1
for	1
my	1
sake!	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
blockhead	1
thinks	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
looks	1
only	1
at	1
Bourienne.	1
No,	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
pride...	1
but	1
I'll	1
let	1
her	1
see...."	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
daughter	1
she	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
mistake	1
and	1
that	1
Anatole	1
meant	1
to	1
flirt	1
with	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
Princess	1
Mary's	1
self-esteem	1
would	1
be	1
wounded	1
and	1
his	1
point	1
(not	1
to	1
be	1
parted	1
from	1
her)	1
would	1
be	1
gained,	1
so	1
pacifying	1
himself	1
with	1
this	1
thought,	1
he	1
called	1
Tikhon	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
undress.	1
	1
"What	1
devil	1
brought	1
them	1
here?"	1
thought	1
he,	1
while	1
Tikhon	1
was	1
putting	1
the	1
nightshirt	1
over	1
his	1
dried-up	1
old	1
body	1
and	1
gray-haired	1
chest.	1
"I	1
never	1
invited	1
them.	1
They	1
came	1
to	1
disturb	1
my	1
life--and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
of	1
it	1
left."	1
	1
"Devil	1
take	1
'em!"	1
he	1
muttered,	1
while	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
still	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
shirt.	1
	1
Tikhon	1
knew	1
his	1
master's	1
habit	1
of	1
sometimes	1
thinking	1
aloud,	1
and	1
therefore	1
met	1
with	1
unaltered	1
looks	1
the	1
angrily	1
inquisitive	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
that	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
shirt.	1
	1
"Gone	1
to	1
bed?"	1
asked	1
the	1
prince.	1
	1
Tikhon,	1
like	1
all	1
good	1
valets,	1
instinctively	1
knew	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
his	1
master's	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
guessed	1
that	1
the	1
question	1
referred	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
his	1
son.	1
	1
"They	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
bed	1
and	1
put	1
out	1
their	1
lights,	1
your	1
excellency."	1
	1
"No	1
good...	1
no	1
good..."	1
said	1
the	1
prince	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
thrusting	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
his	1
slippers	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
into	1
the	1
sleeves	1
of	1
his	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
couch	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
slept.	1
	1
Though	1
no	1
words	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Anatole	1
and	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne,	1
they	1
quite	1
understood	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
romance,	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
pauvre	1
mere;	1
they	1
understood	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
private	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
seeking	1
an	1
opportunity	1
since	1
morning	1
to	1
meet	1
one	1
another	1
alone.	1
When	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
father's	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
and	1
Anatole	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
conservatory.	1
	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
study	1
with	1
special	1
trepidation.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
everybody	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
knew	1
what	1
she	1
thought	1
about	1
it.	1
She	1
read	1
this	1
in	1
Tikhon's	1
face	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Prince	1
Vasili's	1
valet,	1
who	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
when	1
she	1
met	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
corridor	1
carrying	1
hot	1
water.	1
	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
was	1
very	1
affectionate	1
and	1
careful	1
in	1
his	1
treatment	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
that	1
morning.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
well	1
knew	1
this	1
painstaking	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
father's.	1
His	1
face	1
wore	1
that	1
expression	1
when	1
his	1
dry	1
hands	1
clenched	1
with	1
vexation	1
at	1
her	1
not	1
understanding	1
a	1
sum	1
in	1
arithmetic,	1
when	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
he	1
would	1
walk	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
repeating	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
several	1
times	1
over.	1
	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
once,	1
treating	1
her	1
ceremoniously.	1
	1
"I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
proposition	1
made	1
me	1
concerning	1
you,"	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
an	1
unnatural	1
smile.	1
"I	1
expect	1
you	1
have	1
guessed	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
brought	1
his	1
pupil	1
with	1
him"	1
(for	1
some	1
reason	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski	1
referred	1
to	1
Anatole	1
as	1
a	1
"pupil")	1
"for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
my	1
beautiful	1
eyes.	1
Last	1
night	1
a	1
proposition	1
was	1
made	1
me	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
my	1
principles,	1
I	1
refer	1
it	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
understand	1
you,	1
mon	1
pere?"	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
growing	1
pale	1
and	1
then	1
blushing.	1
	1
"How	1
understand	1
me!"	1
cried	1
her	1
father	1
angrily.	1
"Prince	1
Vasili	1
finds	1
you	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
as	1
a	1
daughter-in-law	1
and	1
makes	1
a	1
proposal	1
to	1
you	1
on	1
his	1
pupil's	1
behalf.	1
That's	1
how	1
it's	1
to	1
be	1
understood!	1
'How	1
understand	1
it'!...	1
And	1
I	1
ask	1
you!"	1
	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
think,	1
Father,"	1
whispered	1
the	1
princess.	1
	1
"I?	1
I?	1
What	1
of	1
me?	1
Leave	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
married.	1
What	1
about	1
you?	1
That's	1
what	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know."	1
	1
The	1
princess	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
regarded	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
disapproval,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
thought	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
fate	1
would	1
be	1
decided	1
now	1
or	1
never.	1
She	1
lowered	1
her	1
eyes	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
gaze	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think,	1
but	1
would	1
only	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
submit	1
from	1
habit,	1
and	1
she	1
said:	1
"I	1
wish	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
your	1
will,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
own	1
desire..."	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
finish.	1
The	1
old	1
prince	1
interrupted	1
her.	1
	1
"That's	1
admirable!"	1
he	1
shouted.	1
"He	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
dowry	1
and	1
take	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
She'll	1
be	1
the	1
wife,	1
while	1
you..."	1
	1
The	1
prince	1
stopped.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
effect	1
these	1
words	1
had	1
produced	1
on	1
his	1
daughter.	1
She	1
lowered	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
	1
"Now	1
then,	1
now	1
then,	1
I'm	1
only	1
joking!"	1
he	1
said.	1
"Remember	1
this,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
principle	1
that	1
a	1
maiden	1
has	1
a	1
full	1
right	1
to	1
choose.	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
freedom.	1
Only	1
remember	1
that	1
your	1
life's	1
happiness	1
depends	1
on	1
your	1
decision.	1
Never	1
mind	1
me!"	1
	1
"But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
Father!"	1
	1
"There's	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
talk!	1
He	1
receives	1
his	1
orders	1
and	1
will	1
marry	1
you	1
or	1
anybody;	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
free	1
to	1
choose....	1
Go	1
to	1
your	1
room,	1
think	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
presence:	1
yes	1
or	1
no.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
pray	1
over	1
it.	1
Well,	1
pray	1
if	1
you	1
like,	1
but	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
think	1
it	1
over.	1
Go!	1
Yes	1
or	1
no,	1
yes	1
or	1
no,	1
yes	1
or	1
no!"	1
he	1
still	1
shouted	1
when	1
the	1
princess,	1
as	1
if	1
lost	1
in	1
a	1
fog,	1
had	1
already	1
staggered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
study.	1
	1
Her	1
fate	1
was	1
decided	1
and	1
happily	1
decided.	1
But	1
what	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
said	1
about	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
was	1
dreadful.	1
It	1
was	1
untrue	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
terrible,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
thinking	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
straight	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
neither	1
seeing	1
nor	1
hearing	1
anything,	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
well-known	1
whispering	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
aroused	1
her.	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
two	1
steps	1
away	1
saw	1
Anatole	1
embracing	1
the	1
Frenchwoman	1
and	1
whispering	1
something	1
to	1
her.	1
With	1
a	1
horrified	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
face,	1
Anatole	1
looked	1
at	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
take	1
his	1
arm	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
of	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
seen	1
her.	1
	1
"Who's	1
that?	1
Why?	1
Wait	1
a	1
moment!"	1
Anatole's	1
face	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
in	1
silence.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
At	1
last	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
gave	1
a	1
scream	1
and	1
ran	1
away.	1
Anatole	1
bowed	1
to	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
with	1
a	1
gay	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
inviting	1
her	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
a	1
laugh	1
at	1
this	1
strange	1
incident,	1
and	1
then	1
shrugging	1
his	1
shoulders	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
apartments.	1
	1
An	1
hour	1
later,	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
prince;	1
he	1
added	1
that	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
was	1
also	1
there.	1
When	1
Tikhon	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
holding	1
the	1
weeping	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
gently	1
stroking	1
her	1
hair.	1
The	1
princess'	1
beautiful	1
eyes	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
former	1
calm	1
radiance	1
were	1
looking	1
with	1
tender	1
affection	1
and	1
pity	1
at	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne's	1
pretty	1
face.	1
	1
"No,	1
Princess,	1
I	1
have	1
lost	1
your	1
affection	1
forever!"	1
said	1
Mademoiselle	1
Bourienne.	1
	1
"Why?	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
ever,"	1
said	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
"and	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
for	1
your	1
happiness."	1
	1
"But	1
you	1
despise	1
me.	1
You	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
pure	1
can	1
never	1
understand	1
being	1
so	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
passion.	1
Oh,	1
only	1
my	1
poor	1
mother..."	1
	1
"I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
answered	1
Princess	1
Mary,	1
with	1
a	1
sad	1
smile.	1
"Calm	1
yourself,	1
my	1
dear.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
father,"	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili,	1
with	1
one	1
leg	1
thrown	1
high	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
and	1
a	1
snuffbox	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
deep	1
emotion	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
as	1
if	1
stirred	1
to	1
his	1
heart's	1
core	1
and	1
himself	1
regretting	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
sensibility,	1
when	1
Princess	1
Mary	1
entered.	1
He	1
hurriedly	1
took	1
a	1
pinch	1
of	1
snuff.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear,	1
my	1
dear!"	1
he	1
began,	1
rising	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
by	1
both	1
hands.	1
Then,	1
sighing,	1
he	1
added:	1
"My	1
son's	1
fate	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
hands.	1
Decide,	1
my	1
dear,	1
good,	1
gentle	1
Marie,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
loved	1
as	1
a	1
daughter!"	1
	1
He	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
tear	1
appeared	1
in	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
"Fr...	1
fr..."	1
snorted	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski.	1
"The	1
prince	1
is	1
making	1
a	1
proposition	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
pupil's--I	1
mean,	1
his	1
son's--name.	1
Do	1
you	1
wish	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
Prince	1
Anatole	1
Kuragin's	1
wife?	1
Reply:	1
yes	1
or	1
no,"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
"and	1
then	1
I	1
shall	1
reserve	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
state	1
my	1
opinion	1
also.	1
Yes,	1
my	1
opinion,	1
and	1
only	1
my	1
opinion,"	1
added	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
turning	1
to	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
answering	1
his	1
imploring	1
look.	1
"Yes,	1
or	1
no?"	1
	1
"My	1
desire	1
is	1
never	1
to	1
leave	1
you,	1
Father,	1
never	1
to	1
separate	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
yours.	1
I	1
don't	1
wish	1
to	1
marry,"	1
she	1
answered	1
positively,	1
glancing	1
at	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
and	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Humbug!	1
Nonsense!	1
Humbug,	1
humbug,	1
humbug!"	1
cried	1
Prince	1
Bolkonski,	1
frowning	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
daughter's	1
hand;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
kiss	1
her,	1
but	1
only	1
bending	1
his	1
forehead	1
to	1
hers	1
just	1
touched	1
it,	1
and	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
winced	1
and	1
uttered	1
a	1
cry.	1
	1
Prince	1
Vasili	1
rose.	1
	1
"My	1
dear,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
moment	1
I	1
shall	1
never,	1
never	1
forget.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
will	1
you	1
not	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
hope	1
of	1
touching	1
this	1
heart,	1
so	1
kind	1
and	1
generous?	1
Say	1
'perhaps'...	1
The	1
future	1
is	1
so	1
long.	1
Say	1
'perhaps.'"	1
	1
"Prince,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
is	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
honor,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
your	1
son's	1
wife."	1
	1
"Well,	1
so	1
that's	1
finished,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow!	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
you.	1
Very	1
glad!	1
Go	1
back	1
to	1
your	1
rooms,	1
Princess.	1
Go!"	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
prince.	1
"Very,	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
you,"	1
repeated	1
he,	1
embracing	1
Prince	1
Vasili.	1
	1
"My	1
vocation	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
one,"	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
"My	1
vocation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
another	1
kind	1
of	1
happiness,	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
self-sacrifice.	1
And	1
cost	1
what	1
it	1
may,	1
I	1
will	1
arrange	1
poor	1
Amelie's	1
happiness,	1
she	1
loves	1
him	1
so	1
passionately,	1
and	1
so	1
passionately	1
repents.	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
match	1
between	1
them.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
rich	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
means;	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
Andrew.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
his	1
wife.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
unfortunate,	1
a	1
stranger,	1
alone,	1
helpless!	1
And,	1
oh	1
God,	1
how	1
passionately	1
she	1
must	1
love	1
him	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
so	1
far	1
forget	1
herself!	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same!..."	1
thought	1
Princess	1
Mary.	1
	1
	1

CHAPTER	1
VI	1
	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
the	1
Rostovs	1
had	1
news	1
of	1
Nicholas.	1
Not	1
till	1
midwinter	1
was	1
the	1
count	1
at	1
last	1
handed	1
a	1
letter	1
addressed	1
in	1
his	1
son's	1
handwriting.	1
On	1
receiving	1
it,	1
he	1
ran	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
his	1
study	1
in	1
alarm	1
and	1
haste,	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
notice,	1
closed	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
who	1
always	1
knew	1
everything	1
that	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
on	1
hearing	1
of	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
went	1
softly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
count	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
sobbing	1
and	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
though	1
her	1
circumstances	1
had	1
improved,	1
was	1
still	1
living	1
with	1
the	1
Rostovs.	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
friend?"	1
said	1
she,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
pathetic	1
inquiry,	1
prepared	1
to	1
sympathize	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
sobbed	1
yet	1
more.	1
	1
"Nikolenka...	1
a	1
letter...	1
wa...	1
a...	1
s...	1
wounded...	1
my	1
darling	1
boy...	1
the	1
countess...	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
officer...	1
thank	1
God...	1
How	1
tell	1
the	1
little	1
countess!"	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him,	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
handkerchief	1
wiped	1
the	1
tears	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
letter,	1
then	1
having	1
dried	1
her	1
own	1
eyes	1
she	1
comforted	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
decided	1
that	1
at	1
dinner	1
and	1
till	1
teatime	1
she	1
would	1
prepare	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
after	1
tea,	1
with	1
God's	1
help,	1
would	1
inform	1
her.	1
	1
At	1
dinner	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
talked	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
about	1
the	1
war	1
news	1
and	1
about	1
Nikolenka,	1
twice	1
asked	1
when	1
the	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
from	1
him,	1
though	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
already,	1
and	1
remarked	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
very	1
likely	1
be	1
getting	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
day.	1
Each	1
time	1
that	1
these	1
hints	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
countess	1
anxious	1
and	1
she	1
glanced	1
uneasily	1
at	1
the	1
count	1
and	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
the	1
latter	1
very	1
adroitly	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
insignificant	1
matters.	1
Natasha,	1
who,	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
family,	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
gifted	1
with	1
a	1
capacity	1
to	1
feel	1
any	1
shades	1
of	1
intonation,	1
look,	1
and	1
expression,	1
pricked	1
up	1
her	1
ears	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
meal	1
and	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
secret	1
between	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
was	1
preparing	1
them	1
for	1
it.	1
Bold	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
Natasha,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
sensitive	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
to	1
anything	1
relating	1
to	1
Nikolenka,	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
questions	1
at	1
dinner,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
excited	1
to	1
eat	1
anything	1
and	1
kept	1
wriggling	1
about	1
on	1
her	1
chair	1
regardless	1
of	1
her	1
governess'	1
remarks.	1
After	1
dinner,	1
she	1
rushed	1
head	1
long	1
after	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
and,	1
dashing	1
at	1
her,	1
flung	1
herself	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
overtook	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
sitting	1
room.	1
	1
"Auntie,	1
darling,	1
do	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is!"	1
	1
"Nothing,	1
my	1
dear."	1
	1
"No,	1
dearest,	1
sweet	1
one,	1
honey,	1
I	1
won't	1
give	1
up--I	1
know	1
you	1
know	1
something."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
little	1
slyboots,"	1
she	1
said.	1
	1
"A	1
letter	1
from	1
Nikolenka!	1
I'm	1
sure	1
of	1
it!"	1
exclaimed	1
Natasha,	1
reading	1
confirmation	1
in	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
face.	1
	1
"But	1
for	1
God's	1
sake,	1
be	1
careful,	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
may	1
affect	1
your	1
mamma."	1
	1
"I	1
will,	1
I	1
will,	1
only	1
tell	1
me!	1
You	1
won't?	1
Then	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
at	1
once."	1
	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words,	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
one.	1
	1
"No,	1
on	1
my	1
true	1
word	1
of	1
honor,"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
crossing	1
herself,	1
"I	1
won't	1
tell	1
anyone!"	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"Nikolenka...	1
wounded...	1
a	1
letter,"	1
she	1
announced	1
in	1
gleeful	1
triumph.	1
	1
"Nicholas!"	1
was	1
all	1
Sonya	1
said,	1
instantly	1
turning	1
white.	1
	1
Natasha,	1
seeing	1
the	1
impression	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
wound	1
produced	1
on	1
Sonya,	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
sorrowful	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
news.	1
	1
She	1
rushed	1
to	1
Sonya,	1
hugged	1
her,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
	1
"A	1
little	1
wound,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
an	1
officer;	1
he	1
is	1
well	1
now,	1
he	1
wrote	1
himself,"	1
said	1
she	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"There	1
now!	1
It's	1
true	1
that	1
all	1
you	1
women	1
are	1
crybabies,"	1
remarked	1
Petya,	1
pacing	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
large,	1
resolute	1
strides.	1
"Now	1
I'm	1
very	1
glad,	1
very	1
glad	1
indeed,	1
that	1
my	1
brother	1
has	1
distinguished	1
himself	1
so.	1
You	1
are	1
all	1
blubberers	1
and	1
understand	1
nothing."	1
	1
Natasha	1
smiled	1
through	1
her	1
tears.	1
	1
"You	1
haven't	1
read	1
the	1
letter?"	1
asked	1
Sonya.	1
	1
"No,	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
that	1
he's	1
now	1
an	1
officer."	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
crossing	1
herself.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
she	1
deceived	1
you.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
Mamma."	1
	1
Petya	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
silence	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
"If	1
I'd	1
been	1
in	1
Nikolenka's	1
place	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
even	1
more	1
of	1
those	1
Frenchmen,"	1
he	1
said.	1
"What	1
nasty	1
brutes	1
they	1
are!	1
I'd	1
have	1
killed	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
there'd	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"Hold	1
your	1
tongue,	1
Petya,	1
what	1
a	1
goose	1
you	1
are!"	1
	1
"I'm	1
not	1
a	1
goose,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
who	1
cry	1
about	1
trifles,"	1
said	1
Petya.	1
	1
"Do	1
you	1
remember	1
him?"	1
Natasha	1
suddenly	1
asked,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
silence.	1
	1
Sonya	1
smiled.	1
	1
"Do	1
I	1
remember	1
Nicholas?"	1
	1
"No,	1
Sonya,	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
remember	1
him	1
perfectly,	1
remember	1
everything?"	1
said	1
Natasha,	1
with	1
an	1
expressive	1
gesture,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
words	1
a	1
very	1
definite	1
meaning.	1
"I	1
remember	1
Nikolenka	1
too,	1
I	1
remember	1
him	1
well,"	1
she	1
said.	1
"But	1
I	1
don't	1
remember	1
Boris.	1
I	1
don't	1
remember	1
him	1
a	1
bit."	1
	1
"What!	1
You	1
don't	1
remember	1
Boris?"	1
asked	1
Sonya	1
in	1
surprise.	1
	1
"It's	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
don't	1
remember--I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
like,	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
remember	1
Nikolenka.	1
Him--I	1
just	1
shut	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
remember,	1
but	1
Boris...	1
No!"	1
(She	1
shut	1
her	1
eyes.)	1
"No!	1
there's	1
nothing	1
at	1
all."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
Natasha!"	1
said	1
Sonya,	1
looking	1
ecstatically	1
and	1
earnestly	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
her	1
worthy	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
saying	1
it	1
to	1
someone	1
else,	1
with	1
whom	1
joking	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
"I	1
am	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
your	1
brother	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
and,	1
whatever	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
to	1
me,	1
shall	1
never	1
cease	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live."	1
	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
Sonya	1
with	1
wondering	1
and	1
inquisitive	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
nothing.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
Sonya	1
was	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
love	1
as	1
Sonya	1
was	1
speaking	1
of.	1
But	1
Natasha	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
felt	1
anything	1
like	1
it.	1
She	1
believed	1
it	1
could	1
be,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it.	1
	1
"Shall	1
you	1
write	1
to	1
him?"	1
she	1
asked.	1
	1
Sonya	1
became	1
thoughtful.	1
The	1
question	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
whether	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
write,	1
tormented	1
her.	1
Now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
an	1
officer	1
and	1
a	1
wounded	1
hero,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
to	1
remind	1
him	1
of	1
herself	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
seem,	1
of	1
the	1
obligations	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
on	1
himself?	1
	1
"I	1
don't	1
know.	1
I	1
think	1
if	1
he	1
writes,	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
too,"	1
she	1
said,	1
blushing.	1
	1
"And	1
you	1
won't	1
feel	1
ashamed	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him?"	1
	1
Sonya	1
smiled.	1
	1
"No."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
Boris.	1
I'm	1
not	1
going	1
to."	1
	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
ashamed?"	1
	1
"Well,	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
It's	1
awkward	1
and	1
would	1
make	1
me	1
ashamed."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
know	1
why	1
she'd	1
be	1
ashamed,"	1
said	1
Petya,	1
offended	1
by	1
Natasha's	1
previous	1
remark.	1
"It's	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
fat	1
one	1
in	1
spectacles"	1
(that	1
was	1
how	1
Petya	1
described	1
his	1
namesake,	1
the	1
new	1
Count	1
Bezukhov)	1
"and	1
now	1
she's	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
singer"	1
(he	1
meant	1
Natasha's	1
Italian	1
singing	1
master),	1
"that's	1
why	1
she's	1
ashamed!"	1
	1
"Petya,	1
you're	1
a	1
stupid!"	1
said	1
Natasha.	1
	1
"Not	1
more	1
stupid	1
than	1
you,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
the	1
nine-year-old	1
Petya,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
brigadier.	1
	1
The	1
countess	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
by	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
hints	1
at	1
dinner.	1
On	1
retiring	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
an	1
armchair,	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
miniature	1
portrait	1
of	1
her	1
son	1
on	1
the	1
lid	1
of	1
a	1
snuffbox,	1
while	1
the	1
tears	1
kept	1
coming	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
with	1
the	1
letter,	1
came	1
on	1
tiptoe	1
to	1
the	1
countess'	1
door	1
and	1
paused.	1
	1
"Don't	1
come	1
in,"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
her.	1
"Come	1
later."	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
in,	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
her.	1
	1
The	1
count	1
put	1
his	1
ear	1
to	1
the	1
keyhole	1
and	1
listened.	1
	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
indifferent	1
voices,	1
then	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
voice	1
alone	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
speech,	1
then	1
a	1
cry,	1
then	1
silence,	1
then	1
both	1
voices	1
together	1
with	1
glad	1
intonations,	1
and	1
then	1
footsteps.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna	1
opened	1
the	1
door.	1
Her	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
proud	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
surgeon	1
who	1
has	1
just	1
performed	1
a	1
difficult	1
operation	1
and	1
admits	1
the	1
public	1
to	1
appreciate	1
his	1
skill.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
done!"	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
count,	1
pointing	1
triumphantly	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
who	1
sat	1
holding	1
in	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
snuffbox	1
with	1
its	1
portrait	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
pressing	1
them	1
alternately	1
to	1
her	1
lips.	1
	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
count,	1
she	1
stretched	1
out	1
her	1
arms	1
to	1
him,	1
embraced	1
his	1
bald	1
head,	1
over	1
which	1
she	1
again	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
portrait,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
press	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
lips,	1
she	1
slightly	1
pushed	1
away	1
the	1
bald	1
head.	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
Petya	1
now	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
began.	1
After	1
a	1
brief	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
campaign	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
battles	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
part,	1
and	1
his	1
promotion,	1
Nicholas	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
kissed	1
his	1
father's	1
and	1
mother's	1
hands	1
asking	1
for	1
their	1
blessing,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
kissed	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Petya.	1
Besides	1
that,	1
he	1
sent	1
greetings	1
to	1
Monsieur	1
Schelling,	1
Madame	1
Schoss,	1
and	1
his	1
old	1
nurse,	1
and	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
kiss	1
for	1
him	1
"dear	1
Sonya,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
and	1
thought	1
of	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
ever."	1
When	1
she	1
heard	1
this	1
Sonya	1
blushed	1
so	1
that	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
and,	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
looks	1
turned	1
upon	1
her,	1
ran	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
dancing	1
hall,	1
whirled	1
round	1
it	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
with	1
her	1
dress	1
puffed	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
balloon,	1
and,	1
flushed	1
and	1
smiling,	1
plumped	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
The	1
countess	1
was	1
crying.	1
	1
"Why	1
are	1
you	1
crying,	1
Mamma?"	1
asked	1
Vera.	1
"From	1
all	1
he	1
says	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
not	1
cry."	1
	1
This	1
was	1
quite	1
true,	1
but	1
the	1
count,	1
the	1
countess,	1
and	1
Natasha	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
reproachfully.	1
"And	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
she	1
takes	1
after?"	1
thought	1
the	1
countess.	1
	1
Nicholas'	1
letter	1
was	1
read	1
over	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
considered	1
worthy	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
countess,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hands.	1
The	1
tutors	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
nurses,	1
and	1
Dmitri,	1
and	1
several	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
the	1
countess	1
reread	1
the	1
letter	1
each	1
time	1
with	1
fresh	1
pleasure	1
and	1
each	1
time	1
discovered	1
in	1
it	1
fresh	1
proofs	1
of	1
Nikolenka's	1
virtues.	1
How	1
strange,	1
how	1
extraordinary,	1
how	1
joyful	1
it	1
seemed,	1
that	1
her	1
son,	1
the	1
scarcely	1
perceptible	1
motion	1
of	1
whose	1
tiny	1
limbs	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
within	1
her,	1
that	1
son	1
about	1
whom	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
quarrels	1
with	1
the	1
too	1
indulgent	1
count,	1
that	1
son	1
who	1
had	1
first	1
learned	1
to	1
say	1
"pear"	1
and	1
then	1
"granny,"	1
that	1
this	1
son	1
should	1
now	1
be	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
foreign	1
land	1
amid	1
strange	1
surroundings,	1
a	1
manly	1
warrior	1
doing	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
without	1
help	1
or	1
guidance.	1
The	1
universal	1
experience	1
of	1
ages,	1
showing	1
that	1
children	1
do	1
grow	1
imperceptibly	1
from	1
the	1
cradle	1
to	1
manhood,	1
did	1
not	1
exist	1
for	1
the	1
countess.	1
Her	1
son's	1
growth	1
toward	1
manhood,	1
at	1
each	1
of	1
its	1
stages,	1
had	1
seemed	1
as	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
had	1
never	1
existed	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
who	1
grew	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
As	1
twenty	1
years	1
before,	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
that	1
the	1
little	1
creature	1
who	1
lived	1
somewhere	1
under	1
her	1
heart	1
would	1
ever	1
cry,	1
suck	1
her	1
breast,	1
and	1
begin	1
to	1
speak,	1
so	1
now	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
that	1
little	1
creature	1
could	1
be	1
this	1
strong,	1
brave	1
man,	1
this	1
model	1
son	1
and	1
officer	1
that,	1
judging	1
by	1
this	1
letter,	1
he	1
now	1
was.	1
	1
"What	1
a	1
style!	1
How	1
charmingly	1
he	1
describes!"	1
said	1
she,	1
reading	1
the	1
descriptive	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
"And	1
what	1
a	1
soul!	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
himself....	1
Not	1
a	1
word!	1
About	1
some	1
Denisov	1
or	1
other,	1
though	1
he	1
himself,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
is	1
braver	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
He	1
says	1
nothing	1
about	1
his	1
sufferings.	1
What	1
a	1
heart!	1
How	1
like	1
him	1
it	1
is!	1
And	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
remembered	1
everybody!	1
Not	1
forgetting	1
anyone.	1
I	1
always	1
said	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
so	1
high--I	1
always	1
said...."	1
	1
For	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
week	1
preparations	1
were	1
being	1
made,	1
rough	1
drafts	1
of	1
letters	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
household	1
were	1
written	1
and	1
copied	1
out,	1
while	1
under	1
the	1
supervision	1
of	1
the	1
countess	1
and	1
the	1
solicitude	1
of	1
the	1
count,	1
money	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
uniform	1
and	1
equipment	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
commissioned	1
officer	1
were	1
collected.	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna,	1
practical	1
woman	1
that	1
she	1
was,	1
had	1
even	1
managed	1
by	1
favor	1
with	1
army	1
authorities	1
to	1
secure	1
advantageous	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
for	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
son.	1
She	1
had	1
opportunities	1
of	1
sending	1
her	1
letters	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
Constantine	1
Pavlovich,	1
who	1
commanded	1
the	1
Guards.	1
The	1
Rostovs	1
supposed	1
that	1
The	1
Russian	1
Guards,	1
Abroad,	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
definite	1
address,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
letter	1
reached	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
reach	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
regiment,	1
which	1
was	1
presumably	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
neighborhood.	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
to	1
send	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
money	1
by	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
courier	1
to	1
Boris	1
and	1
Boris	1
was	1
to	1
forward	1
them	1
to	1
Nicholas.	1
The	1
letters	1
were	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
count,	1
the	1
countess,	1
Petya,	1
Vera,	1
Natasha,	1
and	1
Sonya,	1
and	1
finally	1
there	1
were	1
six	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
for	1
his	1
outfit	1
and	1
various	1
other	1
things	1
the	1
old	1
count	1
sent	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1

CHAPTER	1
VII	1
	1
On	1
the	1
twelfth	1
of	1
November,	1
Kutuzov's	1
active	1
army,	1
in	1
camp	1
before	1
Olmutz,	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
be	1
reviewed	1
next	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors--the	1
Russian	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian.	1
The	1
Guards,	1
just	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia,	1
spent	1
the	1
night	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
next	1
morning	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
review,	1
reaching	1
the	1
field	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
by	1
ten	1
o'clock.	1
	1
That	1
day	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Boris,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
Ismaylov	1
regiment	1
was	1
quartered	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
money	1
for	1
him.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
particularly	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
money	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
troops,	1
after	1
their	1
active	1
service,	1
were	1
stationed	1
near	1
Olmutz	1
and	1
the	1
camp	1
swarmed	1
with	1
well-provisioned	1
sutlers	1
and	1
Austrian	1
Jews	1
offering	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
tempting	1
wares.	1
The	1
Pavlograds	1
held	1
feast	1
after	1
feast,	1
celebrating	1
awards	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
for	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
made	1
expeditions	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
to	1
visit	1
a	1
certain	1
Caroline	1
the	1
Hungarian,	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
opened	1
a	1
restaurant	1
there	1
with	1
girls	1
as	1
waitresses.	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
celebrated	1
his	1
promotion	1
to	1
a	1
cornetcy	1
and	1
bought	1
Denisov's	1
horse,	1
Bedouin,	1
was	1
in	1
debt	1
all	1
round,	1
to	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
the	1
sutlers.	1
On	1
receiving	1
Boris'	1
letter	1
he	1
rode	1
with	1
a	1
fellow	1
officer	1
to	1
Olmutz,	1
dined	1
there,	1
drank	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine,	1
and	1
then	1
set	1
off	1
alone	1
to	1
the	1
Guards'	1
camp	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
old	1
playmate.	1
Rostov	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
uniform.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
shabby	1
cadet	1
jacket,	1
decorated	1
with	1
a	1
soldier's	1
cross,	1
equally	1
shabby	1
cadet's	1
riding	1
breeches	1
lined	1
with	1
worn	1
leather,	1
and	1
an	1
officer's	1
saber	1
with	1
a	1
sword	1
knot.	1
The	1
Don	1
horse	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
was	1
one	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
from	1
a	1
Cossack	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
crumpled	1
hussar	1
cap	1
stuck	1
jauntily	1
back	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
head.	1
As	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
camp	1
he	1
thought	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
impress	1
Boris	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
Guards	1
by	1
his	1
appearance--that	1
of	1
a	1
fighting	1
hussar	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
under	1
fire.	1
	1
The	1
Guards	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
whole	1
march	1
as	1
if	1
on	1
a	1
pleasure	1
trip,	1
parading	1
their	1
cleanliness	1
and	1
discipline.	1
They	1
had	1
come	1
by	1
easy	1
stages,	1
their	1
knapsacks	1
conveyed	1
on	1
carts,	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
authorities	1
had	1
provided	1
excellent	1
dinners	1
for	1
the	1
officers	1
at	1
every	1
halting	1
place.	1
The	1
regiments	1
had	1
entered	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
town	1
with	1
their	1
bands	1
playing,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
orders	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
marched	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
step	1
(a	1
practice	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Guards	1
prided	1
themselves),	1
the	1
officers	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
at	1
their	1
proper	1
posts.	1
Boris	1
had	1
been	1
quartered,	1
and	1
had	1
marched	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
with	1
Berg	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
company.	1
Berg,	1
who	1
had	1
obtained	1
his	1
captaincy	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
gained	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
his	1
superiors	1
by	1
his	1
promptitude	1
and	1
accuracy	1
and	1
had	1
arranged	1
his	1
money	1
matters	1
very	1
satisfactorily.	1
Boris,	1
during	1
the	1
campaign,	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
many	1
persons	1
who	1
might	1
prove	1
useful	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
from	1
Pierre	1
had	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
Bolkonski,	1
through	1
whom	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
post	1
on	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
staff.	1
Berg	1
and	1
Boris,	1
having	1
rested	1
after	1
yesterday's	1
march,	1
were	1
sitting,	1
clean	1
and	1
neatly	1
dressed,	1
at	1
a	1
round	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
clean	1
quarters	1
allotted	1
to	1
them,	1
playing	1
chess.	1
Berg	1
held	1
a	1
smoking	1
pipe	1
between	1
his	1
knees.	1
Boris,	1
in	1
the	1
accurate	1
way	1
characteristic	1
of	1
him,	1
was	1
building	1
a	1
little	1
pyramid	1
of	1
chessmen	1
with	1
his	1
delicate	1
white	1
fingers	1
while	1
awaiting	1
Berg's	1
move,	1
and	1
watched	1
his	1
opponent's	1
face,	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
about	1
the	1
game	1
as	1
he	1
always	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
on.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
that?"	1
he	1
remarked.	1
	1
"We'll	1
try	1
to,"	1
replied	1
Berg,	1
touching	1
a	1
pawn	1
and	1
then	1
removing	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
door	1
opened.	1
	1
"Here	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
last!"	1
shouted	1
Rostov.	1
"And	1
Berg	1
too!	1
Oh,	1
you	1
petisenfans,	1
allay	1
cushay	1
dormir!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
imitating	1
his	1
Russian	1
nurse's	1
French,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
Boris	1
used	1
to	1
laugh	1
long	1
ago.	1
	1
"Dear	1
me,	1
how	1
you	1
have	1
changed!"	1
	1
Boris	1
rose	1
to	1
meet	1
Rostov,	1
but	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
omit	1
to	1
steady	1
and	1
replace	1
some	1
chessmen	1
that	1
were	1
falling.	1
He	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
embrace	1
his	1
friend,	1
but	1
Nicholas	1
avoided	1
him.	1
With	1
that	1
peculiar	1
feeling	1
of	1
youth,	1
that	1
dread	1
of	1
beaten	1
tracks,	1
and	1
wish	1
to	1
express	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
its	1
elders	1
which	1
is	1
often	1
insincere,	1
Nicholas	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
special	1
on	1
meeting	1
his	1
friend.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
pinch	1
him,	1
push	1
him,	1
do	1
anything	1
but	1
kiss	1
him--a	1
thing	1
everybody	1
did.	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
this,	1
Boris	1
embraced	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
quiet,	1
friendly	1
way	1
and	1
kissed	1
him	1
three	1
times.	1
	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
nearly	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
and,	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
when	1
young	1
men	1
take	1
their	1
first	1
steps	1
on	1
life's	1
road,	1
each	1
saw	1
immense	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
quite	1
a	1
new	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
those	1
first	1
steps.	1
Both	1
had	1
changed	1
greatly	1
since	1
they	1
last	1
met	1
and	1
both	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
damned	1
dandies!	1
Clean	1
and	1
fresh	1
as	1
if	1
you'd	1
been	1
to	1
a	1
fete,	1
not	1
like	1
us	1
sinners	1
of	1
the	1
line,"	1
cried	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
martial	1
swagger	1
and	1
with	1
baritone	1
notes	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
new	1
to	1
Boris,	1
pointing	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
mud-	1
bespattered	1
breeches.	1
The	1
German	1
landlady,	1
hearing	1
Rostov's	1
loud	1
voice,	1
popped	1
her	1
head	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
"Eh,	1
is	1
she	1
pretty?"	1
he	1
asked	1
with	1
a	1
wink.	1
	1
"Why	1
do	1
you	1
shout	1
so?	1
You'll	1
frighten	1
them!"	1
said	1
Boris.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
you	1
today,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"I	1
only	1
sent	1
you	1
the	1
note	1
yesterday	1
by	1
Bolkonski--an	1
adjutant	1
of	1
Kutuzov's,	1
who's	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
so	1
quickly....	1
Well,	1
how	1
are	1
you?	1
Been	1
under	1
fire	1
already?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
Without	1
answering,	1
Rostov	1
shook	1
the	1
soldier's	1
Cross	1
of	1
St.	1
George	1
fastened	1
to	1
the	1
cording	1
of	1
his	1
uniform	1
and,	1
indicating	1
a	1
bandaged	1
arm,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"As	1
you	1
see,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Indeed?	1
Yes,	1
yes!"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
"And	1
we	1
too	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
splendid	1
march.	1
You	1
know,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
His	1
Imperial	1
Highness	1
rode	1
with	1
our	1
regiment	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
every	1
comfort	1
and	1
every	1
advantage.	1
What	1
receptions	1
we	1
had	1
in	1
Poland!	1
What	1
dinners	1
and	1
balls!	1
I	1
can't	1
tell	1
you.	1
And	1
the	1
Tsarevich	1
was	1
very	1
gracious	1
to	1
all	1
our	1
officers."	1
	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
told	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
doings,	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
hussar	1
revels	1
and	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
fighting	1
line,	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
pleasures	1
and	1
advantages	1
of	1
service	1
under	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
family.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
you	1
Guards!"	1
said	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
say,	1
send	1
for	1
some	1
wine."	1
	1
Boris	1
made	1
a	1
grimace.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
really	1
want	1
it,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
drew	1
a	1
purse	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
clean	1
pillow,	1
and	1
sent	1
for	1
wine.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
money	1
and	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
give	1
you,"	1
he	1
added.	1
	1
Rostov	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
and,	1
throwing	1
the	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
put	1
both	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read.	1
After	1
reading	1
a	1
few	1
lines,	1
he	1
glanced	1
angrily	1
at	1
Berg,	1
then,	1
meeting	1
his	1
eyes,	1
hid	1
his	1
face	1
behind	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"Well,	1
they've	1
sent	1
you	1
a	1
tidy	1
sum,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
eying	1
the	1
heavy	1
purse	1
that	1
sank	1
into	1
the	1
sofa.	1
"As	1
for	1
us,	1
Count,	1
we	1
get	1
along	1
on	1
our	1
pay.	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
for	1
myself..."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
Berg,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"when	1
you	1
get	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
home	1
and	1
meet	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
people	1
whom	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
everything	1
over	1
with,	1
and	1
I	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
I'll	1
go	1
at	1
once,	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
way!	1
Do	1
go	1
somewhere,	1
anywhere...	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
and	1
immediately	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulder	1
and	1
looking	1
amiably	1
into	1
his	1
face,	1
evidently	1
wishing	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
rudeness	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
he	1
added,	1
"Don't	1
be	1
hurt,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow;	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
speak	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
acquaintance."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
don't	1
mention	1
it,	1
Count!	1
I	1
quite	1
understand,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
getting	1
up	1
and	1
speaking	1
in	1
a	1
muffled	1
and	1
guttural	1
voice.	1
	1
"Go	1
across	1
to	1
our	1
hosts:	1
they	1
invited	1
you,"	1
added	1
Boris.	1
	1
Berg	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
cleanest	1
of	1
coats,	1
without	1
a	1
spot	1
or	1
speck	1
of	1
dust,	1
stood	1
before	1
a	1
looking	1
glass	1
and	1
brushed	1
the	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
temples	1
upwards,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
and,	1
having	1
assured	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
at	1
it	1
that	1
his	1
coat	1
had	1
been	1
noticed,	1
left	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile.	1
	1
"Oh	1
dear,	1
what	1
a	1
beast	1
I	1
am!"	1
muttered	1
Rostov,	1
as	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
"Why?"	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
pig	1
I	1
am,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
such	1
a	1
fright!	1
Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
pig	1
I	1
am!"	1
he	1
repeated,	1
flushing	1
suddenly.	1
"Well,	1
have	1
you	1
sent	1
Gabriel	1
for	1
some	1
wine?	1
All	1
right	1
let's	1
have	1
some!"	1
	1
In	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
parents	1
was	1
enclosed	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation	1
to	1
Bagration	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
countess	1
at	1
Anna	1
Mikhaylovna's	1
advice	1
had	1
obtained	1
through	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
her	1
son,	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
its	1
destination	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
"What	1
nonsense!	1
Much	1
I	1
need	1
it!"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
throwing	1
the	1
letter	1
under	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
"Why	1
have	1
you	1
thrown	1
that	1
away?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"It	1
is	1
some	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation...	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
do	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
for!"	1
	1
"Why	1
'What	1
the	1
devil'?"	1
said	1
Boris,	1
picking	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
reading	1
the	1
address.	1
"This	1
letter	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
to	1
you."	1
	1
"I	1
want	1
nothing,	1
and	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
anyone's	1
adjutant."	1
	1
"Why	1
not?"	1
inquired	1
Boris.	1
	1
"It's	1
a	1
lackey's	1
job!"	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
dreamer,	1
I	1
see,"	1
remarked	1
Boris,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
"And	1
you're	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
diplomatist!	1
But	1
that's	1
not	1
the	1
point...	1
Come,	1
how	1
are	1
you?"	1
asked	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Well,	1
as	1
you	1
see.	1
So	1
far	1
everything's	1
all	1
right,	1
but	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
should	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
adjutant	1
and	1
not	1
remain	1
at	1
the	1
front."	1
	1
"Why?"	1
	1
"Because	1
when	1
once	1
a	1
man	1
starts	1
on	1
military	1
service,	1
he	1
should	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
as	1
successful	1
a	1
career	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
possible."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that's	1
it!"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
of	1
something	1
else.	1
	1
He	1
looked	1
intently	1
and	1
inquiringly	1
into	1
his	1
friend's	1
eyes,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
some	1
question.	1
	1
Old	1
Gabriel	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
wine.	1
	1
"Shouldn't	1
we	1
now	1
send	1
for	1
Berg?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
"He	1
would	1
drink	1
with	1
you.	1
I	1
can't."	1
	1
"Well,	1
send	1
for	1
him...	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
that	1
German?"	1
asked	1
Rostov,	1
with	1
a	1
contemptuous	1
smile.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
very,	1
very	1
nice,	1
honest,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
fellow,"	1
answered	1
Boris.	1
	1
Again	1
Rostov	1
looked	1
intently	1
into	1
Boris'	1
eyes	1
and	1
sighed.	1
Berg	1
returned,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
conversation	1
between	1
the	1
three	1
officers	1
became	1
animated.	1
The	1
Guardsmen	1
told	1
Rostov	1
of	1
their	1
march	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
much	1
of	1
in	1
Russia,	1
Poland,	1
and	1
abroad.	1
They	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
sayings	1
and	1
doings	1
of	1
their	1
commander,	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke,	1
and	1
told	1
stories	1
of	1
his	1
kindness	1
and	1
irascibility.	1
Berg,	1
as	1
usual,	1
kept	1
silent	1
when	1
the	1
subject	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke's	1
quick	1
temper	1
he	1
related	1
with	1
gusto	1
how	1
in	1
Galicia	1
he	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
when	1
the	1
latter	1
made	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
the	1
regiments	1
and	1
was	1
annoyed	1
at	1
the	1
irregularity	1
of	1
a	1
movement.	1
With	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile	1
Berg	1
related	1
how	1
the	1
Grand	1
Duke	1
had	1
ridden	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
passion,	1
shouting:	1
"Arnauts!"	1
("Arnauts"	1
was	1
the	1
Tsarevich's	1
favorite	1
expression	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
rage)	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
company	1
commander.	1
	1
"Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Count,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
alarmed,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
right.	1
Without	1
boasting,	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
Army	1
Orders	1
by	1
heart	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
Regulations	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
Lord's	1
Prayer.	1
So,	1
Count,	1
there	1
never	1
is	1
any	1
negligence	1
in	1
my	1
company,	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
conscience	1
was	1
at	1
ease.	1
I	1
came	1
forward...."	1
(Berg	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
showed	1
how	1
he	1
presented	1
himself,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cap,	1
and	1
really	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
for	1
a	1
face	1
to	1
express	1
greater	1
respect	1
and	1
self-	1
complacency	1
than	1
his	1
did.)	1
"Well,	1
he	1
stormed	1
at	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
stormed	1
and	1
stormed	1
and	1
stormed!	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
life	1
but	1
rather	1
of	1
death,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
'Albanians!'	1
and	1
'devils!'	1
and	1
'To	1
Siberia!'"	1
said	1
Berg	1
with	1
a	1
sagacious	1
smile.	1
"I	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
so	1
I	1
kept	1
silent;	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
best,	1
Count?...	1
'Hey,	1
are	1
you	1
dumb?'	1
he	1
shouted.	1
Still	1
I	1
remained	1
silent.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Count?	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
Orders	1
of	1
the	1
Day.	1
That's	1
what	1
keeping	1
one's	1
head	1
means.	1
That's	1
the	1
way,	1
Count,"	1
said	1
Berg,	1
lighting	1
his	1
pipe	1
and	1
emitting	1
rings	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
that	1
was	1
fine,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
smiling.	1
	1
But	1
Boris	1
noticed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
Berg,	1
and	1
skillfully	1
changed	1
the	1
subject.	1
He	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
wound.	1
This	1
pleased	1
Rostov	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
talking	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
became	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
animated.	1
He	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair,	1
just	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
generally	1
do	1
describe	1
it,	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
like	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
described	1
by	1
others,	1
and	1
as	1
sounds	1
well,	1
but	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
was.	1
Rostov	1
was	1
a	1
truthful	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
have	1
told	1
a	1
deliberate	1
lie.	1
He	1
began	1
his	1
story	1
meaning	1
to	1
tell	1
everything	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
happened,	1
but	1
imperceptibly,	1
involuntarily,	1
and	1
inevitably	1
he	1
lapsed	1
into	1
falsehood.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
his	1
hearers--who	1
like	1
himself	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
stories	1
of	1
attacks	1
and	1
had	1
formed	1
a	1
definite	1
idea	1
of	1
what	1
an	1
attack	1
was	1
and	1
were	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
story--they	1
would	1
either	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
him	1
or,	1
still	1
worse,	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
Rostov	1
was	1
himself	1
to	1
blame	1
since	1
what	1
generally	1
happens	1
to	1
the	1
narrators	1
of	1
cavalry	1
attacks	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
them	1
simply	1
that	1
everyone	1
went	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
sprained	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
from	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
into	1
the	1
wood.	1
Besides,	1
to	1
tell	1
everything	1
as	1
it	1
really	1
happened,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
effort	1
of	1
will	1
to	1
tell	1
only	1
what	1
happened.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
rarely	1
capable	1
of	1
it.	1
His	1
hearers	1
expected	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
beside	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
aflame	1
with	1
excitement,	1
he	1
had	1
flown	1
like	1
a	1
storm	1
at	1
the	1
square,	1
cut	1
his	1
way	1
in,	1
slashed	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
how	1
his	1
saber	1
had	1
tasted	1
flesh	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
all	1
that.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
story,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
saying:	1
"You	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
what	1
a	1
strange	1
frenzy	1
one	1
experiences	1
during	1
an	1
attack,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
whom	1
Boris	1
was	1
expecting,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
liked	1
to	1
help	1
young	1
men,	1
was	1
flattered	1
by	1
being	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
assistance	1
and	1
being	1
well	1
disposed	1
toward	1
Boris,	1
who	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
please	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
wanted.	1
Having	1
been	1
sent	1
with	1
papers	1
from	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
he	1
looked	1
in	1
on	1
Boris,	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
alone.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
saw	1
an	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
line	1
recounting	1
his	1
military	1
exploits	1
(Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
man),	1
he	1
gave	1
Boris	1
a	1
pleasant	1
smile,	1
frowned	1
as	1
with	1
half-closed	1
eyes	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Rostov,	1
bowed	1
slightly	1
and	1
wearily,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
languidly	1
on	1
the	1
sofa:	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
have	1
dropped	1
in	1
on	1
bad	1
company.	1
Rostov	1
flushed	1
up	1
on	1
noticing	1
this,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care,	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
stranger.	1
Glancing,	1
however,	1
at	1
Boris,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
too	1
seemed	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
of	1
the	1
line.	1
	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
disagreeable,	1
ironical	1
tone,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
contempt	1
with	1
which	1
Rostov,	1
from	1
his	1
fighting	1
army	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
regarded	1
all	1
these	1
little	1
adjutants	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
newcomer	1
was	1
evidently	1
one,	1
Rostov	1
felt	1
confused,	1
blushed,	1
and	1
became	1
silent.	1
Boris	1
inquired	1
what	1
news	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
staff,	1
and	1
what,	1
without	1
indiscretion,	1
one	1
might	1
ask	1
about	1
our	1
plans.	1
	1
"We	1
shall	1
probably	1
advance,"	1
replied	1
Bolkonski,	1
evidently	1
reluctant	1
to	1
say	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
stranger.	1
	1
Berg	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
ask,	1
with	1
great	1
politeness,	1
whether,	1
as	1
was	1
rumored,	1
the	1
allowance	1
of	1
forage	1
money	1
to	1
captains	1
of	1
companies	1
would	1
be	1
doubled.	1
To	1
this	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
give	1
no	1
opinion	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
government	1
order,	1
and	1
Berg	1
laughed	1
gaily.	1
	1
"As	1
to	1
your	1
business,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
continued,	1
addressing	1
Boris,	1
"we	1
will	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
later"	1
(and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
Rostov).	1
"Come	1
to	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
review	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
possible."	1
	1
And,	1
having	1
glanced	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
turned	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
whose	1
state	1
of	1
unconquerable	1
childish	1
embarrassment	1
now	1
changing	1
to	1
anger	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
notice,	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Schon	1
Grabern	1
affair?	1
Were	1
you	1
there?"	1
	1
"I	1
was	1
there,"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
angrily,	1
as	1
if	1
intending	1
to	1
insult	1
the	1
aide-	1
de-camp.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
noticed	1
the	1
hussar's	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
it	1
amused	1
him.	1
With	1
a	1
slightly	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
he	1
said:	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
stories	1
now	1
told	1
about	1
that	1
affair!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
stories!"	1
repeated	1
Rostov	1
loudly,	1
looking	1
with	1
eyes	1
suddenly	1
grown	1
furious,	1
now	1
at	1
Boris,	1
now	1
at	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Yes,	1
many	1
stories!	1
But	1
our	1
stories	1
are	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fire!	1
Our	1
stories	1
have	1
some	1
weight,	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
those	1
fellows	1
on	1
the	1
staff	1
who	1
get	1
rewards	1
without	1
doing	1
anything!"	1
	1
"Of	1
whom	1
you	1
imagine	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
one?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
a	1
quiet	1
and	1
particularly	1
amiable	1
smile.	1
	1
A	1
strange	1
feeling	1
of	1
exasperation	1
and	1
yet	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
this	1
man's	1
self-possession	1
mingled	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
talking	1
about	1
you,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
you	1
and,	1
frankly,	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to.	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
in	1
general."	1
	1
"And	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
this,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
interrupted	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
quiet	1
authority,	1
"you	1
wish	1
to	1
insult	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
haven't	1
sufficient	1
self-respect,	1
but	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
place	1
are	1
very	1
badly	1
chosen.	1
In	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
serious	1
duel,	1
and	1
besides,	1
Drubetskoy,	1
who	1
says	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
of	1
yours,	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
blame	1
that	1
my	1
face	1
has	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
displease	1
you.	1
However,"	1
he	1
added	1
rising,	1
"you	1
know	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
where	1
to	1
find	1
me,	1
but	1
don't	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
regard	1
either	1
myself	1
or	1
you	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
insulted,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
older	1
than	1
you,	1
my	1
advice	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop.	1
Well	1
then,	1
on	1
Friday	1
after	1
the	1
review	1
I	1
shall	1
expect	1
you,	1
Drubetskoy.	1
Au	1
revoir!"	1
exclaimed	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
them	1
both	1
he	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
gone	1
did	1
Rostov	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
angry	1
at	1
having	1
omitted	1
to	1
say	1
it.	1
He	1
ordered	1
his	1
horse	1
at	1
once	1
and,	1
coldly	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Boris,	1
rode	1
home.	1
Should	1
he	1
go	1
to	1
headquarters	1
next	1
day	1
and	1
challenge	1
that	1
affected	1
adjutant,	1
or	1
really	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
drop,	1
was	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
worried	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
way.	1
He	1
thought	1
angrily	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
at	1
seeing	1
the	1
fright	1
of	1
that	1
small	1
and	1
frail	1
but	1
proud	1
man	1
when	1
covered	1
by	1
his	1
pistol,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
felt	1
with	1
surprise	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
he	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
he	1
would	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
as	1
that	1
very	1
adjutant	1
whom	1
he	1
so	1
hated.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
VIII	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
Rostov	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
Boris,	1
a	1
review	1
was	1
held	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
and	1
Russian	1
troops,	1
both	1
those	1
freshly	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
campaigning	1
under	1
Kutuzov.	1
The	1
two	1
Emperors,	1
the	1
Russian	1
with	1
his	1
heir	1
the	1
Tsarevich,	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
with	1
the	1
Archduke,	1
inspected	1
the	1
allied	1
army	1
of	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
From	1
early	1
morning	1
the	1
smart	1
clean	1
troops	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
move,	1
forming	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
before	1
the	1
fortress.	1
Now	1
thousands	1
of	1
feet	1
and	1
bayonets	1
moved	1
and	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
officers'	1
command,	1
turned	1
with	1
banners	1
flying,	1
formed	1
up	1
at	1
intervals,	1
and	1
wheeled	1
round	1
other	1
similar	1
masses	1
of	1
infantry	1
in	1
different	1
uniforms;	1
now	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
rhythmic	1
beat	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
the	1
jingling	1
of	1
showy	1
cavalry	1
in	1
blue,	1
red,	1
and	1
green	1
braided	1
uniforms,	1
with	1
smartly	1
dressed	1
bandsmen	1
in	1
front	1
mounted	1
on	1
black,	1
roan,	1
or	1
gray	1
horses;	1
then	1
again,	1
spreading	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
brazen	1
clatter	1
of	1
the	1
polished	1
shining	1
cannon	1
that	1
quivered	1
on	1
the	1
gun	1
carriages	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
linstocks,	1
came	1
the	1
artillery	1
which	1
crawled	1
between	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
cavalry	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
its	1
appointed	1
position.	1
Not	1
only	1
the	1
generals	1
in	1
full	1
parade	1
uniforms,	1
with	1
their	1
thin	1
or	1
thick	1
waists	1
drawn	1
in	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
their	1
red	1
necks	1
squeezed	1
into	1
their	1
stiff	1
collars,	1
and	1
wearing	1
scarves	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
decorations,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
elegant,	1
pomaded	1
officers,	1
but	1
every	1
soldier	1
with	1
his	1
freshly	1
washed	1
and	1
shaven	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
weapons	1
clean	1
and	1
polished	1
to	1
the	1
utmost,	1
and	1
every	1
horse	1
groomed	1
till	1
its	1
coat	1
shone	1
like	1
satin	1
and	1
every	1
hair	1
of	1
its	1
wetted	1
mane	1
lay	1
smooth--felt	1
that	1
no	1
small	1
matter	1
was	1
happening,	1
but	1
an	1
important	1
and	1
solemn	1
affair.	1
Every	1
general	1
and	1
every	1
soldier	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
insignificance,	1
aware	1
of	1
being	1
but	1
a	1
drop	1
in	1
that	1
ocean	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
yet	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
strength	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
enormous	1
whole.	1
	1
From	1
early	1
morning	1
strenuous	1
activities	1
and	1
efforts	1
had	1
begun	1
and	1
by	1
ten	1
o'clock	1
all	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
into	1
due	1
order.	1
The	1
ranks	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
vast	1
field.	1
The	1
whole	1
army	1
was	1
extended	1
in	1
three	1
lines:	1
the	1
cavalry	1
in	1
front,	1
behind	1
it	1
the	1
artillery,	1
and	1
behind	1
that	1
again	1
the	1
infantry.	1
	1
A	1
space	1
like	1
a	1
street	1
was	1
left	1
between	1
each	1
two	1
lines	1
of	1
troops.	1
The	1
three	1
parts	1
of	1
that	1
army	1
were	1
sharply	1
distinguished:	1
Kutuzov's	1
fighting	1
army	1
(with	1
the	1
Pavlograds	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
flank	1
of	1
the	1
front);	1
those	1
recently	1
arrived	1
from	1
Russia,	1
both	1
Guards	1
and	1
regiments	1
of	1
the	1
line;	1
and	1
the	1
Austrian	1
troops.	1
But	1
they	1
all	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
lines,	1
under	1
one	1
command,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
like	1
order.	1
	1
Like	1
wind	1
over	1
leaves	1
ran	1
an	1
excited	1
whisper:	1
"They're	1
coming!	1
They're	1
coming!"	1
Alarmed	1
voices	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
a	1
stir	1
of	1
final	1
preparation	1
swept	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
troops.	1
	1
From	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Olmutz	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
group	1
was	1
seen	1
approaching.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
though	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
still,	1
a	1
light	1
gust	1
of	1
wind	1
blowing	1
over	1
the	1
army	1
slightly	1
stirred	1
the	1
streamers	1
on	1
the	1
lances	1
and	1
the	1
unfolded	1
standards	1
fluttered	1
against	1
their	1
staffs.	1
It	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
that	1
slight	1
motion	1
the	1
army	1
itself	1
was	1
expressing	1
its	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
One	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
shouting:	1
"Eyes	1
front!"	1
Then,	1
like	1
the	1
crowing	1
of	1
cocks	1
at	1
sunrise,	1
this	1
was	1
repeated	1
by	1
others	1
from	1
various	1
sides	1
and	1
all	1
became	1
silent.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
deathlike	1
stillness	1
only	1
the	1
tramp	1
of	1
horses	1
was	1
heard.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
suites.	1
The	1
Emperors	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
flank,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpets	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
cavalry	1
regiment	1
played	1
the	1
general	1
march.	1
It	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
trumpeters	1
were	1
playing,	1
but	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
army	1
itself,	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
approach,	1
had	1
naturally	1
burst	1
into	1
music.	1
Amid	1
these	1
sounds,	1
only	1
the	1
youthful	1
kindly	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
was	1
clearly	1
heard.	1
He	1
gave	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
greeting,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
regiment	1
roared	1
"Hurrah!"	1
so	1
deafeningly,	1
continuously,	1
and	1
joyfully	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
themselves	1
were	1
awed	1
by	1
their	1
multitude	1
and	1
the	1
immensity	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
they	1
constituted.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
lines	1
of	1
Kutuzov's	1
army	1
which	1
the	1
Tsar	1
approached	1
first,	1
experienced	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
army:	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
self-forgetfulness,	1
a	1
proud	1
consciousness	1
of	1
might,	1
and	1
a	1
passionate	1
attraction	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
triumph.	1
	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
at	1
a	1
single	1
word	1
from	1
that	1
man	1
all	1
this	1
vast	1
mass	1
(and	1
he	1
himself	1
an	1
insignificant	1
atom	1
in	1
it)	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
fire	1
and	1
water,	1
commit	1
crime,	1
die,	1
or	1
perform	1
deeds	1
of	1
highest	1
heroism,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
tremble	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
stand	1
still	1
at	1
the	1
imminence	1
of	1
that	1
word.	1
	1
"Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!"	1
thundered	1
from	1
all	1
sides,	1
one	1
regiment	1
after	1
another	1
greeting	1
the	1
Tsar	1
with	1
the	1
strains	1
of	1
the	1
march,	1
and	1
then	1
"Hurrah!"...	1
Then	1
the	1
general	1
march,	1
and	1
again	1
"Hurrah!	1
Hurrah!"	1
growing	1
ever	1
stronger	1
and	1
fuller	1
and	1
merging	1
into	1
a	1
deafening	1
roar.	1
	1
Till	1
the	1
Tsar	1
reached	1
it,	1
each	1
regiment	1
in	1
its	1
silence	1
and	1
immobility	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
lifeless	1
body,	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
it	1
became	1
alive,	1
its	1
thunder	1
joining	1
the	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
line	1
along	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
passed.	1
Through	1
the	1
terrible	1
and	1
deafening	1
roar	1
of	1
those	1
voices,	1
amid	1
the	1
square	1
masses	1
of	1
troops	1
standing	1
motionless	1
as	1
if	1
turned	1
to	1
stone,	1
hundreds	1
of	1
riders	1
composing	1
the	1
suites	1
moved	1
carelessly	1
but	1
symmetrically	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
freely,	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
two	1
men--the	1
Emperors.	1
Upon	1
them	1
the	1
undivided,	1
tensely	1
passionate	1
attention	1
of	1
that	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
men	1
was	1
concentrated.	1
	1
The	1
handsome	1
young	1
Emperor	1
Alexander,	1
in	1
the	1
uniform	1
of	1
the	1
Horse	1
Guards,	1
wearing	1
a	1
cocked	1
hat	1
with	1
its	1
peaks	1
front	1
and	1
back,	1
with	1
his	1
pleasant	1
face	1
and	1
resonant	1
though	1
not	1
loud	1
voice,	1
attracted	1
everyone's	1
attention.	1
	1
Rostov	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
trumpeters,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
keen	1
sight	1
had	1
recognized	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
watched	1
his	1
approach.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
twenty	1
paces,	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
could	1
clearly	1
distinguish	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
his	1
handsome,	1
happy	1
young	1
face,	1
he	1
experienced	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
ecstasy	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
known.	1
Every	1
trait	1
and	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
enchanting.	1
	1
Stopping	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
Pavlograds,	1
the	1
Tsar	1
said	1
something	1
in	1
French	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
Emperor	1
and	1
smiled.	1
	1
Seeing	1
that	1
smile,	1
Rostov	1
involuntarily	1
smiled	1
himself	1
and	1
felt	1
a	1
still	1
stronger	1
flow	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
sovereign.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
love	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
impossible	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cry.	1
The	1
Tsar	1
called	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
said	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"Oh	1
God,	1
what	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
the	1
Emperor	1
spoke	1
to	1
me?"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
"I	1
should	1
die	1
of	1
happiness!"	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
addressed	1
the	1
officers	1
also:	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
all,	1
gentlemen,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
with	1
my	1
whole	1
heart."	1
To	1
Rostov	1
every	1
word	1
sounded	1
like	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven.	1
How	1
gladly	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
died	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
his	1
Tsar!	1
	1
"You	1
have	1
earned	1
the	1
St.	1
George's	1
standards	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
them."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
to	1
die,	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
him,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
said	1
something	1
more	1
which	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
straining	1
their	1
lungs,	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
	1
Rostov	1
too,	1
bending	1
over	1
his	1
saddle,	1
shouted	1
"Hurrah!"	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
injure	1
himself	1
by	1
that	1
shout,	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
rapture	1
fully.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
stopped	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
hussars	1
as	1
if	1
undecided.	1
	1
"How	1
can	1
the	1
Emperor	1
be	1
undecided?"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
but	1
then	1
even	1
this	1
indecision	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
majestic	1
and	1
enchanting,	1
like	1
everything	1
else	1
the	1
Tsar	1
did.	1
	1
That	1
hesitation	1
lasted	1
only	1
an	1
instant.	1
The	1
Tsar's	1
foot,	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
pointed	1
boot	1
then	1
fashionable,	1
touched	1
the	1
groin	1
of	1
the	1
bobtailed	1
bay	1
mare	1
he	1
rode,	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
glove	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
reins,	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
off	1
accompanied	1
by	1
an	1
irregularly	1
swaying	1
sea	1
of	1
aides-de-camp.	1
Farther	1
and	1
farther	1
he	1
rode	1
away,	1
stopping	1
at	1
other	1
regiments,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
only	1
his	1
white	1
plumes	1
were	1
visible	1
to	1
Rostov	1
from	1
amid	1
the	1
suites	1
that	1
surrounded	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
	1
Among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
suite,	1
Rostov	1
noticed	1
Bolkonski,	1
sitting	1
his	1
horse	1
indolently	1
and	1
carelessly.	1
Rostov	1
recalled	1
their	1
quarrel	1
of	1
yesterday	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
presented	1
itself	1
whether	1
he	1
ought	1
or	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
challenge	1
Bolkonski.	1
"Of	1
course	1
not!"	1
he	1
now	1
thought.	1
"Is	1
it	1
worth	1
thinking	1
or	1
speaking	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment?	1
At	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
such	1
love,	1
such	1
rapture,	1
and	1
such	1
self-sacrifice,	1
what	1
do	1
any	1
of	1
our	1
quarrels	1
and	1
affronts	1
matter?	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
forgive	1
everybody	1
now."	1
	1
When	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
passed	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
regiments,	1
the	1
troops	1
began	1
a	1
ceremonial	1
march	1
past	1
him,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
on	1
Bedouin,	1
recently	1
purchased	1
from	1
Denisov,	1
rode	1
past	1
too,	1
at	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
his	1
squadron--that	1
is,	1
alone	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
Before	1
he	1
reached	1
him,	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
splendid	1
horseman,	1
spurred	1
Bedouin	1
twice	1
and	1
successfully	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
showy	1
trot	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
animal	1
went	1
when	1
excited.	1
Bending	1
his	1
foaming	1
muzzle	1
to	1
his	1
chest,	1
his	1
tail	1
extended,	1
Bedouin,	1
as	1
if	1
also	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eye	1
upon	1
him,	1
passed	1
splendidly,	1
lifting	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
a	1
high	1
and	1
graceful	1
action,	1
as	1
if	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
without	1
touching	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
Rostov	1
himself,	1
his	1
legs	1
well	1
back	1
and	1
his	1
stomach	1
drawn	1
in	1
and	1
feeling	1
himself	1
one	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
rode	1
past	1
the	1
Emperor	1
with	1
a	1
frowning	1
but	1
blissful	1
face	1
"like	1
a	1
vewy	1
devil,"	1
as	1
Denisov	1
expressed	1
it.	1
	1
"Fine	1
fellows,	1
the	1
Pavlograds!"	1
remarked	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"My	1
God,	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
if	1
he	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
leap	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
this	1
instant!"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
review	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
officers,	1
and	1
also	1
Kutuzov's,	1
collected	1
in	1
groups	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
awards,	1
about	1
the	1
Austrians	1
and	1
their	1
uniforms,	1
about	1
their	1
lines,	1
about	1
Bonaparte,	1
and	1
how	1
badly	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
fare	1
now,	1
especially	1
if	1
the	1
Essen	1
corps	1
arrived	1
and	1
Prussia	1
took	1
our	1
side.	1
	1
But	1
the	1
talk	1
in	1
every	1
group	1
was	1
chiefly	1
about	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander.	1
His	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
movement	1
was	1
described	1
with	1
ecstasy.	1
	1
They	1
all	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
wish:	1
to	1
advance	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
under	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
command.	1
Commanded	1
by	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
vanquish	1
anyone,	1
be	1
it	1
whom	1
it	1
might:	1
so	1
thought	1
Rostov	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
after	1
the	1
review.	1
	1
All	1
were	1
then	1
more	1
confident	1
of	1
victory	1
than	1
the	1
winning	1
of	1
two	1
battles	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
them.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
IX	1
	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
review,	1
Boris,	1
in	1
his	1
best	1
uniform	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
comrade	1
Berg's	1
best	1
wishes	1
for	1
success,	1
rode	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
to	1
see	1
Bolkonski,	1
wishing	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
his	1
friendliness	1
and	1
obtain	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
best	1
post	1
he	1
could--preferably	1
that	1
of	1
adjutant	1
to	1
some	1
important	1
personage,	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
most	1
attractive.	1
"It	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
Rostov,	1
whose	1
father	1
sends	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
rubles	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
not	1
wishing	1
to	1
cringe	1
to	1
anybody	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
anyone's	1
lackey,	1
but	1
I	1
who	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
brains	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
career	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
miss	1
opportunities,	1
but	1
must	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
them!"	1
he	1
reflected.	1
	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
Olmutz	1
that	1
day,	1
but	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
where	1
the	1
headquarters	1
and	1
the	1
diplomatic	1
corps	1
were	1
stationed	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors	1
were	1
living	1
with	1
their	1
suites,	1
households,	1
and	1
courts	1
only	1
strengthened	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
that	1
higher	1
world.	1
	1
He	1
knew	1
no	1
one,	1
and	1
despite	1
his	1
smart	1
Guardsman's	1
uniform,	1
all	1
these	1
exalted	1
personages	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
their	1
elegant	1
carriages	1
with	1
their	1
plumes,	1
ribbons,	1
and	1
medals,	1
both	1
courtiers	1
and	1
military	1
men,	1
seemed	1
so	1
immeasurably	1
above	1
him,	1
an	1
insignificant	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Guards,	1
that	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to,	1
but	1
simply	1
could	1
not,	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
existence.	1
At	1
the	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Kutuzov,	1
where	1
he	1
inquired	1
for	1
Bolkonski,	1
all	1
the	1
adjutants	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
orderlies	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
wished	1
to	1
impress	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
officers	1
like	1
him	1
were	1
always	1
coming	1
there	1
and	1
that	1
everybody	1
was	1
heartily	1
sick	1
of	1
them.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
or	1
rather	1
because	1
of	1
it,	1
next	1
day,	1
November	1
15,	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
again	1
went	1
to	1
Olmutz	1
and,	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
occupied	1
by	1
Kutuzov,	1
asked	1
for	1
Bolkonski.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
in	1
and	1
Boris	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
large	1
hall	1
probably	1
formerly	1
used	1
for	1
dancing,	1
but	1
in	1
which	1
five	1
beds	1
now	1
stood,	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
various	1
kinds:	1
a	1
table,	1
chairs,	1
and	1
a	1
clavichord.	1
One	1
adjutant,	1
nearest	1
the	1
door,	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
a	1
Persian	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
writing.	1
Another,	1
the	1
red,	1
stout	1
Nesvitski,	1
lay	1
on	1
a	1
bed	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
under	1
his	1
head,	1
laughing	1
with	1
an	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
beside	1
him.	1
A	1
third	1
was	1
playing	1
a	1
Viennese	1
waltz	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
while	1
a	1
fourth,	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
clavichord,	1
sang	1
the	1
tune.	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
None	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
changed	1
his	1
position	1
on	1
seeing	1
Boris.	1
The	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
writing	1
and	1
whom	1
Boris	1
addressed	1
turned	1
round	1
crossly	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
Bolkonski	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
into	1
the	1
reception	1
room	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Boris	1
thanked	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
some	1
ten	1
officers	1
and	1
generals.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
entered,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
his	1
eyes	1
drooping	1
contemptuously	1
(with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
expression	1
of	1
polite	1
weariness	1
which	1
plainly	1
says,	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
duty	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
moment"),	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
an	1
old	1
Russian	1
general	1
with	1
decorations,	1
who	1
stood	1
very	1
erect,	1
almost	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
with	1
a	1
soldier's	1
obsequious	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
purple	1
face,	1
reporting	1
something.	1
	1
"Very	1
well,	1
then,	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
wait,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
in	1
Russian,	1
speaking	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
intonation	1
he	1
affected	1
when	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
contemptuously,	1
and	1
noticing	1
Boris,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
paying	1
no	1
more	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
ran	1
after	1
him	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
more,	1
nodded	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
smile.	1
	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
Boris	1
clearly	1
realized	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
before	1
surmised,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
army,	1
besides	1
the	1
subordination	1
and	1
discipline	1
prescribed	1
in	1
the	1
military	1
code,	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
knew	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
there	1
was	1
another,	1
more	1
important,	1
subordination,	1
which	1
made	1
this	1
tight-laced,	1
purple-faced	1
general	1
wait	1
respectfully	1
while	1
Captain	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
pleasure,	1
chose	1
to	1
chat	1
with	1
Lieutenant	1
Drubetskoy.	1
More	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
Boris	1
resolved	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
future	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
written	1
code,	1
but	1
under	1
this	1
unwritten	1
law.	1
He	1
felt	1
now	1
that	1
merely	1
by	1
having	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
risen	1
above	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
annihilate	1
him,	1
a	1
lieutenant	1
of	1
the	1
Guards.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
yesterday.	1
I	1
was	1
fussing	1
about	1
with	1
Germans	1
all	1
day.	1
We	1
went	1
with	1
Weyrother	1
to	1
survey	1
the	1
dispositions.	1
When	1
Germans	1
start	1
being	1
accurate,	1
there's	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
it!"	1
	1
Boris	1
smiled,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
alluding	1
to	1
as	1
something	1
generally	1
known.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Weyrother's	1
name,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
term	1
"dispositions."	1
	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
so	1
you	1
still	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
adjutant?	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
was	1
thinking"--for	1
some	1
reason	1
Boris	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
blushing--	1
"of	1
asking	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Prince	1
Kuragin	1
about	1
me.	1
I	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
ask	1
because	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
Guards	1
won't	1
be	1
in	1
action,"	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
apology.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right.	1
We'll	1
talk	1
it	1
over,"	1
replied	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Only	1
let	1
me	1
report	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
business,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
disposal."	1
	1
While	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
to	1
report	1
about	1
the	1
purple-faced	1
general,	1
that	1
gentleman--evidently	1
not	1
sharing	1
Boris'	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
unwritten	1
code	1
of	1
subordination--looked	1
so	1
fixedly	1
at	1
the	1
presumptuous	1
lieutenant	1
who	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
finishing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
adjutant	1
that	1
Boris	1
felt	1
uncomfortable.	1
He	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
waited	1
impatiently	1
for	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
commander-in-	1
chief's	1
room.	1
	1
"You	1
see,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
you,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
clavichord	1
was.	1
"It's	1
no	1
use	1
your	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
He	1
would	1
say	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
pleasant	1
things,	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
dinner"	1
("That	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
bad	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
unwritten	1
code,"	1
thought	1
Boris),	1
"but	1
nothing	1
more	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it.	1
There	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
us	1
aides-de-camp	1
and	1
adjutants!	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
we'll	1
do:	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
friend,	1
an	1
adjutant	1
general	1
and	1
an	1
excellent	1
fellow,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov;	1
and	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
know	1
it,	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
now	1
Kutuzov	1
with	1
his	1
staff	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
count	1
for	1
nothing.	1
Everything	1
is	1
now	1
centered	1
round	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
So	1
we	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
Dolgorukov;	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
anyhow	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
you.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
cannot	1
attach	1
you	1
to	1
himself	1
or	1
find	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you	1
somewhere	1
nearer	1
the	1
sun."	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
always	1
became	1
specially	1
keen	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
guide	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
worldly	1
success.	1
Under	1
cover	1
of	1
obtaining	1
help	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
for	1
another,	1
which	1
from	1
pride	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
accept	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
kept	1
in	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
circle	1
which	1
confers	1
success	1
and	1
which	1
attracted	1
him.	1
He	1
very	1
readily	1
took	1
up	1
Boris'	1
cause	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
palace	1
at	1
Olmutz	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
Emperors	1
and	1
their	1
retinues.	1
	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
had	1
been	1
held	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Hofkriegsrath	1
and	1
both	1
Emperors	1
took	1
part.	1
At	1
that	1
council,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
generals	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
Prince	1
Schwartzenberg,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
decided	1
to	1
advance	1
immediately	1
and	1
give	1
battle	1
to	1
Bonaparte.	1
The	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
was	1
just	1
over	1
when	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Boris	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
palace	1
to	1
find	1
Dolgorukov.	1
Everyone	1
at	1
headquarters	1
was	1
still	1
under	1
the	1
spell	1
of	1
the	1
day's	1
council,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
had	1
triumphed.	1
The	1
voices	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
counseled	1
delay	1
and	1
advised	1
waiting	1
for	1
something	1
else	1
before	1
advancing	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
completely	1
silenced	1
and	1
their	1
arguments	1
confuted	1
by	1
such	1
conclusive	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
attacking	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
discussed	1
at	1
the	1
council--the	1
coming	1
battle	1
and	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
would	1
certainly	1
result	1
from	1
it--no	1
longer	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
past.	1
All	1
the	1
advantages	1
were	1
on	1
our	1
side.	1
Our	1
enormous	1
forces,	1
undoubtedly	1
superior	1
to	1
Napoleon's,	1
were	1
concentrated	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
the	1
troops	1
inspired	1
by	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
presence	1
were	1
eager	1
for	1
action.	1
The	1
strategic	1
position	1
where	1
the	1
operations	1
would	1
take	1
place	1
was	1
familiar	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
details	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian	1
General	1
Weyrother:	1
a	1
lucky	1
accident	1
had	1
ordained	1
that	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
should	1
maneuver	1
the	1
previous	1
year	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
fields	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
fought;	1
the	1
adjacent	1
locality	1
was	1
known	1
and	1
shown	1
in	1
every	1
detail	1
on	1
the	1
maps,	1
and	1
Bonaparte,	1
evidently	1
weakened,	1
was	1
undertaking	1
nothing.	1
	1
Dolgorukov,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
warmest	1
advocates	1
of	1
an	1
attack,	1
had	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
council,	1
tired	1
and	1
exhausted	1
but	1
eager	1
and	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
victory	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
gained.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
introduced	1
his	1
protege,	1
but	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
politely	1
and	1
firmly	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
Boris	1
and,	1
evidently	1
unable	1
to	1
suppress	1
the	1
thoughts	1
which	1
were	1
uppermost	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
addressed	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
in	1
French.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
what	1
a	1
battle	1
we	1
have	1
gained!	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
victorious!	1
However,	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
he	1
said	1
abruptly	1
and	1
eagerly,	1
"I	1
must	1
confess	1
to	1
having	1
been	1
unjust	1
to	1
the	1
Austrians	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
Weyrother.	1
What	1
exactitude,	1
what	1
minuteness,	1
what	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
locality,	1
what	1
foresight	1
for	1
every	1
eventuality,	1
every	1
possibility	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
smallest	1
detail!	1
No,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
no	1
conditions	1
better	1
than	1
our	1
present	1
ones	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
devised.	1
This	1
combination	1
of	1
Austrian	1
precision	1
with	1
Russian	1
valor--what	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
wished	1
for?"	1
	1
"So	1
the	1
attack	1
is	1
definitely	1
resolved	1
on?"	1
asked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
know,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
has	1
decidedly	1
lost	1
bearings,	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
received	1
from	1
him	1
today	1
for	1
the	1
Emperor."	1
Dolgorukov	1
smiled	1
significantly.	1
	1
"Is	1
that	1
so?	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
he	1
say?"	1
inquired	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"What	1
can	1
he	1
say?	1
Tra-di-ri-di-ra	1
and	1
so	1
on...	1
merely	1
to	1
gain	1
time.	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
our	1
hands,	1
that's	1
certain!	1
But	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
amusing,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden,	1
good-natured	1
laugh,	1
"was	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
how	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
reply!	1
If	1
not	1
as	1
'Consul'	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
not	1
as	1
'Emperor,'	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
'General	1
Bonaparte.'"	1
	1
"But	1
between	1
not	1
recognizing	1
him	1
as	1
Emperor	1
and	1
calling	1
him	1
General	1
Bonaparte,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
difference,"	1
remarked	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"That's	1
just	1
it,"	1
interrupted	1
Dolgorukov	1
quickly,	1
laughing.	1
"You	1
know	1
Bilibin--he's	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
fellow.	1
He	1
suggested	1
addressing	1
him	1
as	1
'Usurper	1
and	1
Enemy	1
of	1
Mankind.'"	1
	1
Dolgorukov	1
laughed	1
merrily.	1
	1
"Only	1
that?"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
it	1
was	1
Bilibin	1
who	1
found	1
a	1
suitable	1
form	1
for	1
the	1
address.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
clever	1
fellow."	1
	1
"What	1
was	1
it?"	1
	1
"To	1
the	1
Head	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
Government...	1
Au	1
chef	1
du	1
gouvernement	1
francais,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
with	1
grave	1
satisfaction.	1
"Good,	1
wasn't	1
it?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
dislike	1
it	1
extremely,"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Oh	1
yes,	1
very	1
much!	1
My	1
brother	1
knows	1
him,	1
he's	1
dined	1
with	1
him--the	1
present	1
Emperor--more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
Paris,	1
and	1
tells	1
me	1
he	1
never	1
met	1
a	1
more	1
cunning	1
or	1
subtle	1
diplomatist--you	1
know,	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
French	1
adroitness	1
and	1
Italian	1
play-acting!	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
tale	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
Count	1
Markov?	1
Count	1
Markov	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
handle	1
him.	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
handkerchief?	1
It	1
is	1
delightful!"	1
	1
And	1
the	1
talkative	1
Dolgorukov,	1
turning	1
now	1
to	1
Boris,	1
now	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
told	1
how	1
Bonaparte	1
wishing	1
to	1
test	1
Markov,	1
our	1
ambassador,	1
purposely	1
dropped	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
Markov,	1
probably	1
expecting	1
Markov	1
to	1
pick	1
it	1
up	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
Markov	1
immediately	1
dropped	1
his	1
own	1
beside	1
it	1
and	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
without	1
touching	1
Bonaparte's.	1
	1
"Delightful!"	1
said	1
Bolkonski.	1
"But	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
you,	1
Prince,	1
as	1
a	1
petitioner	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man.	1
You	1
see..."	1
but	1
before	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
finish,	1
an	1
aide-de-camp	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
summon	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
nuisance,"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
getting	1
up	1
hurriedly	1
and	1
pressing	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Boris.	1
"You	1
know	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
both	1
for	1
you	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
dear	1
young	1
man."	1
Again	1
he	1
pressed	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
good-natured,	1
sincere,	1
and	1
animated	1
levity.	1
"But	1
you	1
see...	1
another	1
time!"	1
	1
Boris	1
was	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
being	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
powers	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious	1
that	1
here	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
springs	1
that	1
set	1
in	1
motion	1
the	1
enormous	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
which	1
in	1
his	1
regiment	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
a	1
tiny,	1
obedient,	1
and	1
insignificant	1
atom.	1
They	1
followed	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor	1
and	1
met--coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
room	1
by	1
which	1
Dolgorukov	1
had	1
entered--a	1
short	1
man	1
in	1
civilian	1
clothes	1
with	1
a	1
clever	1
face	1
and	1
sharply	1
projecting	1
jaw	1
which,	1
without	1
spoiling	1
his	1
face,	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
peculiar	1
vivacity	1
and	1
shiftiness	1
of	1
expression.	1
This	1
short	1
man	1
nodded	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
intimate	1
friend	1
and	1
stared	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
with	1
cool	1
intensity,	1
walking	1
straight	1
toward	1
him	1
and	1
evidently	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
bow	1
or	1
to	1
step	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
neither:	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
animosity	1
appeared	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
turned	1
away	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
corridor.	1
	1
"Who	1
was	1
that?"	1
asked	1
Boris.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable,	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
unpleasant	1
of	1
men--the	1
Minister	1
of	1
Foreign	1
Affairs,	1
Prince	1
Adam	1
Czartoryski....	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
men	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
decide	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
nations,"	1
added	1
Bolkonski	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
suppress,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
palace.	1
	1
Next	1
day,	1
the	1
army	1
began	1
its	1
campaign,	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
Boris	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
either	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
or	1
Dolgorukov	1
again	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
the	1
Ismaylov	1
regiment.	1

CHAPTER	1
X	1
	1
At	1
dawn	1
on	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
of	1
November,	1
Denisov's	1
squadron,	1
in	1
which	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
served	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Prince	1
Bagration's	1
detachment,	1
moved	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
night,	1
advancing	1
into	1
action	1
as	1
arranged,	1
and	1
after	1
going	1
behind	1
other	1
columns	1
for	1
about	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
was	1
stopped	1
on	1
the	1
highroad.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
squadrons	1
of	1
hussars	1
and	1
infantry	1
battalions	1
and	1
artillery	1
pass	1
by	1
and	1
go	1
forward	1
and	1
then	1
Generals	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Dolgorukov	1
ride	1
past	1
with	1
their	1
adjutants.	1
All	1
the	1
fear	1
before	1
action	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
as	1
previously,	1
all	1
the	1
inner	1
struggle	1
to	1
conquer	1
that	1
fear,	1
all	1
his	1
dreams	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
true	1
hussar	1
in	1
this	1
battle,	1
had	1
been	1
wasted.	1
Their	1
squadron	1
remained	1
in	1
reserve	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
Rostov	1
spent	1
that	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
dull	1
and	1
wretched	1
mood.	1
At	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
he	1
heard	1
firing	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
shouts	1
of	1
hurrah,	1
and	1
saw	1
wounded	1
being	1
brought	1
back	1
(there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
of	1
them),	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
a	1
whole	1
detachment	1
of	1
French	1
cavalry	1
was	1
brought	1
in,	1
convoyed	1
by	1
a	1
sotnya	1
of	1
Cossacks.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
affair	1
was	1
over	1
and,	1
though	1
not	1
big,	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
successful	1
engagement.	1
The	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
returning	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory,	1
of	1
the	1
occupation	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Wischau	1
and	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
French	1
squadron.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
bright	1
and	1
sunny	1
after	1
a	1
sharp	1
night	1
frost,	1
and	1
the	1
cheerful	1
glitter	1
of	1
that	1
autumn	1
day	1
was	1
in	1
keeping	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
victory	1
which	1
was	1
conveyed,	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
tales	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
joyful	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
officers,	1
generals,	1
and	1
adjutants,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
Rostov	1
going	1
or	1
coming.	1
And	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
vainly	1
suffered	1
all	1
the	1
dread	1
that	1
precedes	1
a	1
battle	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
that	1
happy	1
day	1
in	1
inactivity,	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
depressed.	1
	1
"Come	1
here,	1
Wostov.	1
Let's	1
dwink	1
to	1
dwown	1
our	1
gwief!"	1
shouted	1
Denisov,	1
who	1
had	1
settled	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
roadside	1
with	1
a	1
flask	1
and	1
some	1
food.	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
gathered	1
round	1
Denisov's	1
canteen,	1
eating	1
and	1
talking.	1
	1
"There!	1
They	1
are	1
bringing	1
another!"	1
cried	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
indicating	1
a	1
captive	1
French	1
dragoon	1
who	1
was	1
being	1
brought	1
in	1
on	1
foot	1
by	1
two	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
leading	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
a	1
fine	1
large	1
French	1
horse	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
prisoner.	1
	1
"Sell	1
us	1
that	1
horse!"	1
Denisov	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Cossacks.	1
	1
"If	1
you	1
like,	1
your	1
honor!"	1
	1
The	1
officers	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
Cossacks	1
and	1
their	1
prisoner.	1
The	1
French	1
dragoon	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
Alsatian	1
who	1
spoke	1
French	1
with	1
a	1
German	1
accent.	1
He	1
was	1
breathless	1
with	1
agitation,	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
red,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
some	1
French	1
spoken	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
officers,	1
addressing	1
first	1
one,	1
then	1
another.	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
taken,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
fault	1
but	1
the	1
corporal's	1
who	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
seize	1
some	1
horsecloths,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
Russians	1
were	1
there.	1
And	1
at	1
every	1
word	1
he	1
added:	1
"But	1
don't	1
hurt	1
my	1
little	1
horse!"	1
and	1
stroked	1
the	1
animal.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
grasp	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
Now	1
he	1
excused	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
prisoner	1
and	1
now,	1
imagining	1
himself	1
before	1
his	1
own	1
officers,	1
insisted	1
on	1
his	1
soldierly	1
discipline	1
and	1
zeal	1
in	1
the	1
service.	1
He	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
our	1
rearguard	1
all	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
alien	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
The	1
Cossacks	1
sold	1
the	1
horse	1
for	1
two	1
gold	1
pieces,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
being	1
the	1
richest	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
money,	1
bought	1
it.	1
	1
"But	1
don't	1
hurt	1
my	1
little	1
horse!"	1
said	1
the	1
Alsatian	1
good-naturedly	1
to	1
Rostov	1
when	1
the	1
animal	1
was	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
hussar.	1
	1
Rostov	1
smilingly	1
reassured	1
the	1
dragoon	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
money.	1
	1
"Alley!	1
Alley!"	1
said	1
the	1
Cossack,	1
touching	1
the	1
prisoner's	1
arm	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
go	1
on.	1
	1
"The	1
Emperor!	1
The	1
Emperor!"	1
was	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
among	1
the	1
hussars.	1
	1
All	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
and	1
bustle,	1
and	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
coming	1
up	1
the	1
road	1
behind	1
him	1
several	1
riders	1
with	1
white	1
plumes	1
in	1
their	1
hats.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
everyone	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
waiting.	1
	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
or	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
place	1
and	1
mounted.	1
Instantly	1
his	1
regret	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
action	1
and	1
his	1
dejected	1
mood	1
amid	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
had	1
gone,	1
instantly	1
every	1
thought	1
of	1
himself	1
had	1
vanished.	1
He	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
happiness	1
at	1
his	1
nearness	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
nearness	1
by	1
itself	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
lost.	1
He	1
was	1
happy	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
when	1
the	1
longed-for	1
moment	1
of	1
meeting	1
arrives.	1
Not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
round	1
and	1
without	1
looking	1
round,	1
he	1
was	1
ecstatically	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
approach.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
hoofs	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
cavalcade,	1
but	1
because	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
everything	1
grew	1
brighter,	1
more	1
joyful,	1
more	1
significant,	1
and	1
more	1
festive	1
around	1
him.	1
Nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
Rostov	1
came	1
that	1
sun	1
shedding	1
beams	1
of	1
mild	1
and	1
majestic	1
light	1
around,	1
and	1
already	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
enveloped	1
in	1
those	1
beams,	1
he	1
heard	1
his	1
voice,	1
that	1
kindly,	1
calm,	1
and	1
majestic	1
voice	1
that	1
was	1
yet	1
so	1
simple!	1
And	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
Rostov's	1
feeling,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
deathly	1
stillness	1
amid	1
which	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
voice.	1
	1
"The	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars?"	1
he	1
inquired.	1
	1
"The	1
reserves,	1
sire!"	1
replied	1
a	1
voice,	1
a	1
very	1
human	1
one	1
compared	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
said:	1
"The	1
Pavlograd	1
hussars?"	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
drew	1
level	1
with	1
Rostov	1
and	1
halted.	1
Alexander's	1
face	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
at	1
the	1
review.	1
It	1
shone	1
with	1
such	1
gaiety	1
and	1
youth,	1
such	1
innocent	1
youth,	1
that	1
it	1
suggested	1
the	1
liveliness	1
of	1
a	1
fourteen-year-old	1
boy,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
majestic	1
Emperor.	1
Casually,	1
while	1
surveying	1
the	1
squadron,	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
met	1
Rostov's	1
and	1
rested	1
on	1
them	1
for	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
seconds.	1
Whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
Emperor	1
understood	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
Rostov's	1
soul	1
(it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Rostov	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
everything),	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
his	1
light-blue	1
eyes	1
gazed	1
for	1
about	1
two	1
seconds	1
into	1
Rostov's	1
face.	1
A	1
gentle,	1
mild	1
light	1
poured	1
from	1
them.	1
Then	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyebrows,	1
abruptly	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
foot,	1
and	1
galloped	1
on.	1
	1
The	1
younger	1
Emperor	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
his	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
remonstrances	1
of	1
his	1
courtiers,	1
at	1
twelve	1
o'clock	1
left	1
the	1
third	1
column	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
and	1
galloped	1
toward	1
the	1
vanguard.	1
Before	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
hussars,	1
several	1
adjutants	1
met	1
him	1
with	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
successful	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
action.	1
	1
This	1
battle,	1
which	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
a	1
French	1
squadron,	1
was	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
brilliant	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
French,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
Emperor	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
especially	1
while	1
the	1
smoke	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
battlefield,	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
been	1
defeated	1
and	1
were	1
retreating	1
against	1
their	1
will.	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
after	1
the	1
Emperor	1
had	1
passed,	1
the	1
Pavlograd	1
division	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
advance.	1
In	1
Wischau	1
itself,	1
a	1
petty	1
German	1
town,	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
the	1
Emperor	1
again.	1
In	1
the	1
market	1
place,	1
where	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
rather	1
heavy	1
firing	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
arrival,	1
lay	1
several	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded	1
soldiers	1
whom	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
time	1
to	1
move.	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
his	1
suite	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
courtiers,	1
was	1
riding	1
a	1
bobtailed	1
chestnut	1
mare,	1
a	1
different	1
one	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ridden	1
at	1
the	1
review,	1
and	1
bending	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
he	1
gracefully	1
held	1
a	1
gold	1
lorgnette	1
to	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
lay	1
prone,	1
with	1
blood	1
on	1
his	1
uncovered	1
head.	1
The	1
wounded	1
soldier	1
was	1
so	1
dirty,	1
coarse,	1
and	1
revolting	1
that	1
his	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor	1
shocked	1
Rostov.	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
how	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
rather	1
round	1
shoulders	1
shuddered	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
cold	1
shiver	1
had	1
run	1
down	1
them,	1
how	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
began	1
convulsively	1
tapping	1
the	1
horse's	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
well-trained	1
horse	1
looked	1
round	1
unconcerned	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stir.	1
An	1
adjutant,	1
dismounting,	1
lifted	1
the	1
soldier	1
under	1
the	1
arms	1
to	1
place	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
stretcher	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought.	1
The	1
soldier	1
groaned.	1
	1
"Gently,	1
gently!	1
Can't	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
more	1
gently?"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
apparently	1
suffering	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
dying	1
soldier,	1
and	1
he	1
rode	1
away.	1
	1
Rostov	1
saw	1
tears	1
filling	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
eyes	1
and	1
heard	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
riding	1
away,	1
say	1
to	1
Czartoryski:	1
"What	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing	1
war	1
is:	1
what	1
a	1
terrible	1
thing!	1
Quelle	1
terrible	1
chose	1
que	1
la	1
guerre!"	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
vanguard	1
were	1
stationed	1
before	1
Wischau,	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy's	1
lines,	1
which	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
had	1
yielded	1
ground	1
to	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
firing.	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
gratitude	1
was	1
announced	1
to	1
the	1
vanguard,	1
rewards	1
were	1
promised,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
received	1
a	1
double	1
ration	1
of	1
vodka.	1
The	1
campfires	1
crackled	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
songs	1
resounded	1
even	1
more	1
merrily	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
night.	1
Denisov	1
celebrated	1
his	1
promotion	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
major,	1
and	1
Rostov,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
drunk	1
enough,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
proposed	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
health.	1
"Not	1
'our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor,'	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
at	1
official	1
dinners,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
that	1
good,	1
enchanting,	1
and	1
great	1
man!	1
Let	1
us	1
drink	1
to	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
certain	1
defeat	1
of	1
the	1
French!"	1
	1
"If	1
we	1
fought	1
before,"	1
he	1
said,	1
"not	1
letting	1
the	1
French	1
pass,	1
as	1
at	1
Schon	1
Grabern,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
do	1
now	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
front?	1
We	1
will	1
all	1
die	1
for	1
him	1
gladly!	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
gentlemen?	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
saying	1
it	1
right,	1
I	1
have	1
drunk	1
a	1
good	1
deal--but	1
that	1
is	1
how	1
I	1
feel,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
you	1
too!	1
To	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
Alexander	1
the	1
First!	1
Hurrah!"	1
	1
"Hurrah!"	1
rang	1
the	1
enthusiastic	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
officers.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
cavalry	1
captain,	1
Kirsten,	1
shouted	1
enthusiastically	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
sincerely	1
than	1
the	1
twenty-year-old	1
Rostov.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
officers	1
had	1
emptied	1
and	1
smashed	1
their	1
glasses,	1
Kirsten	1
filled	1
others	1
and,	1
in	1
shirt	1
sleeves	1
and	1
breeches,	1
went	1
glass	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
bonfires	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
long	1
gray	1
mustache,	1
his	1
white	1
chest	1
showing	1
under	1
his	1
open	1
shirt,	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
a	1
majestic	1
pose	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
campfire,	1
waving	1
his	1
uplifted	1
arm.	1
	1
"Lads!	1
here's	1
to	1
our	1
Sovereign,	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
victory	1
over	1
our	1
enemies!	1
Hurrah!"	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
his	1
dashing,	1
old,	1
hussar's	1
baritone.	1
	1
The	1
hussars	1
crowded	1
round	1
and	1
responded	1
heartily	1
with	1
loud	1
shouts.	1
	1
Late	1
that	1
night,	1
when	1
all	1
had	1
separated,	1
Denisov	1
with	1
his	1
short	1
hand	1
patted	1
his	1
favorite,	1
Rostov,	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
	1
"As	1
there's	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
on	1
campaign,	1
he's	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar,"	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
"Denisov,	1
don't	1
make	1
fun	1
of	1
it!"	1
cried	1
Rostov.	1
"It	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
lofty,	1
beautiful	1
feeling,	1
such	1
a..."	1
	1
"I	1
believe	1
it,	1
I	1
believe	1
it,	1
fwiend,	1
and	1
I	1
share	1
and	1
appwove..."	1
	1
"No,	1
you	1
don't	1
understand!"	1
	1
And	1
Rostov	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
wandering	1
among	1
the	1
campfires,	1
dreaming	1
of	1
what	1
happiness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
die--not	1
in	1
saving	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
life	1
(he	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
dream	1
of	1
that),	1
but	1
simply	1
to	1
die	1
before	1
his	1
eyes.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
future	1
triumph.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
man	1
to	1
experience	1
that	1
feeling	1
during	1
those	1
memorable	1
days	1
preceding	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz:	1
nine	1
tenths	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
were	1
then	1
in	1
love,	1
though	1
less	1
ecstatically,	1
with	1
their	1
Tsar	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
arms.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XI	1
	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
Emperor	1
stopped	1
at	1
Wischau,	1
and	1
Villier,	1
his	1
physician,	1
was	1
repeatedly	1
summoned	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
At	1
headquarters	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
troops	1
near	1
by	1
the	1
news	1
spread	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
was	1
unwell.	1
He	1
ate	1
nothing	1
and	1
had	1
slept	1
badly	1
that	1
night,	1
those	1
around	1
him	1
reported.	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
indisposition	1
was	1
the	1
strong	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
his	1
sensitive	1
mind	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
killed	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
At	1
daybreak	1
on	1
the	1
seventeenth,	1
a	1
French	1
officer	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
flag	1
of	1
truce,	1
demanding	1
an	1
audience	1
with	1
the	1
Russian	1
Emperor,	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
Wischau	1
from	1
our	1
outposts.	1
This	1
officer	1
was	1
Savary.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
had	1
only	1
just	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
and	1
so	1
Savary	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
At	1
midday	1
he	1
was	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
and	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
he	1
rode	1
off	1
with	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
to	1
the	1
advanced	1
post	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
rumored	1
that	1
Savary	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
to	1
propose	1
to	1
Alexander	1
a	1
meeting	1
with	1
Napoleon.	1
To	1
the	1
joy	1
and	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
army,	1
a	1
personal	1
interview	1
was	1
refused,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Sovereign,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov,	1
the	1
victor	1
at	1
Wischau,	1
was	1
sent	1
with	1
Savary	1
to	1
negotiate	1
with	1
Napoleon	1
if,	1
contrary	1
to	1
expectations,	1
these	1
negotiations	1
were	1
actuated	1
by	1
a	1
real	1
desire	1
for	1
peace.	1
	1
Toward	1
evening	1
Dolgorukov	1
came	1
back,	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
Tsar,	1
and	1
remained	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
eighteenth	1
and	1
nineteenth	1
of	1
November,	1
the	1
army	1
advanced	1
two	1
days'	1
march	1
and	1
the	1
enemy's	1
outposts	1
after	1
a	1
brief	1
interchange	1
of	1
shots	1
retreated.	1
In	1
the	1
highest	1
army	1
circles	1
from	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
nineteenth,	1
a	1
great,	1
excitedly	1
bustling	1
activity	1
began	1
which	1
lasted	1
till	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
when	1
the	1
memorable	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz	1
was	1
fought.	1
	1
Till	1
midday	1
on	1
the	1
nineteenth,	1
the	1
activity--the	1
eager	1
talk,	1
running	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
dispatching	1
of	1
adjutants--was	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
afternoon	1
of	1
that	1
day,	1
this	1
activity	1
reached	1
Kutuzov's	1
headquarters	1
and	1
the	1
staffs	1
of	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
columns.	1
By	1
evening,	1
the	1
adjutants	1
had	1
spread	1
it	1
to	1
all	1
ends	1
and	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
from	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
to	1
the	1
twentieth,	1
the	1
whole	1
eighty	1
thousand	1
allied	1
troops	1
rose	1
from	1
their	1
bivouacs	1
to	1
the	1
hum	1
of	1
voices,	1
and	1
the	1
army	1
swayed	1
and	1
started	1
in	1
one	1
enormous	1
mass	1
six	1
miles	1
long.	1
	1
The	1
concentrated	1
activity	1
which	1
had	1
begun	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
had	1
started	1
the	1
whole	1
movement	1
that	1
followed	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
first	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
wheel	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
tower	1
clock.	1
One	1
wheel	1
slowly	1
moved,	1
another	1
was	1
set	1
in	1
motion,	1
and	1
a	1
third,	1
and	1
wheels	1
began	1
to	1
revolve	1
faster	1
and	1
faster,	1
levers	1
and	1
cogwheels	1
to	1
work,	1
chimes	1
to	1
play,	1
figures	1
to	1
pop	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
hands	1
to	1
advance	1
with	1
regular	1
motion	1
as	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
activity.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
a	1
clock,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
mechanism	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
machine,	1
an	1
impulse	1
once	1
given	1
leads	1
to	1
the	1
final	1
result;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
indifferently	1
quiescent	1
till	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
motion	1
is	1
transmitted	1
to	1
them	1
are	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
mechanism	1
which	1
the	1
impulse	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
reached.	1
Wheels	1
creak	1
on	1
their	1
axles	1
as	1
the	1
cogs	1
engage	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
revolving	1
pulleys	1
whirr	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
their	1
movement,	1
but	1
a	1
neighboring	1
wheel	1
is	1
as	1
quiet	1
and	1
motionless	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
remain	1
so	1
for	1
a	1
hundred	1
years;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
comes	1
when	1
the	1
lever	1
catches	1
it	1
and	1
obeying	1
the	1
impulse	1
that	1
wheel	1
begins	1
to	1
creak	1
and	1
joins	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
motion	1
the	1
result	1
and	1
aim	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
beyond	1
its	1
ken.	1
	1
Just	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
clock,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
complicated	1
motion	1
of	1
innumerable	1
wheels	1
and	1
pulleys	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
regular	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
which	1
show	1
the	1
time,	1
so	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
complicated	1
human	1
activities	1
of	1
160,000	1
Russians	1
and	1
French--all	1
their	1
passions,	1
desires,	1
remorse,	1
humiliations,	1
sufferings,	1
outbursts	1
of	1
pride,	1
fear,	1
and	1
enthusiasm--was	1
only	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
the	1
so-called	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
Emperors--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
slow	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
dial	1
of	1
human	1
history.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
on	1
duty	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
in	1
constant	1
attendance	1
on	1
the	1
commander-in-chief.	1
	1
At	1
six	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
Kutuzov	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
and	1
after	1
staying	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
Tsar	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
grand	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
Count	1
Tolstoy.	1
	1
Bolkonski	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
action	1
from	1
Dolgorukov.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
upset	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
about	1
something	1
and	1
that	1
at	1
headquarters	1
they	1
were	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
also	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
headquarters	1
everyone	1
adopted	1
toward	1
him	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
know	1
something	1
others	1
do	1
not	1
know:	1
he	1
therefore	1
wished	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
"Well,	1
how	1
d'you	1
do,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow?"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
tea	1
with	1
Bilibin.	1
"The	1
fete	1
is	1
for	1
tomorrow.	1
How	1
is	1
your	1
old	1
fellow?	1
Out	1
of	1
sorts?"	1
	1
"I	1
won't	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
but	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
heard."	1
	1
"But	1
they	1
heard	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
talks	1
sense,	1
but	1
to	1
temporize	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
something	1
now	1
when	1
Bonaparte	1
fears	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
battle	1
is	1
impossible."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
him?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"Well,	1
what	1
is	1
Bonaparte	1
like?	1
How	1
did	1
he	1
impress	1
you?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
fears	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
engagement,"	1
repeated	1
Dolgorukov,	1
evidently	1
prizing	1
this	1
general	1
conclusion	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
from	1
his	1
interview	1
with	1
Napoleon.	1
"If	1
he	1
weren't	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
battle	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
ask	1
for	1
that	1
interview?	1
Why	1
negotiate,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
why	1
retreat,	1
when	1
to	1
retreat	1
is	1
so	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
method	1
of	1
conducting	1
war?	1
Believe	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
afraid,	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
battle.	1
His	1
hour	1
has	1
come!	1
Mark	1
my	1
words!"	1
	1
"But	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
he	1
like,	1
eh?"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again.	1
	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
gray	1
overcoat,	1
very	1
anxious	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
call	1
him	1
'Your	1
Majesty,'	1
but	1
who,	1
to	1
his	1
chagrin,	1
got	1
no	1
title	1
from	1
me!	1
That's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
man	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,"	1
replied	1
Dolgorukov,	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
Bilibin	1
with	1
a	1
smile.	1
	1
"Despite	1
my	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
old	1
Kutuzov,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"we	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
set	1
of	1
fellows	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
wait	1
about	1
and	1
so	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
escape,	1
or	1
to	1
trick	1
us,	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
certainly	1
have	1
him	1
in	1
our	1
hands!	1
No,	1
we	1
mustn't	1
forget	1
Suvorov	1
and	1
his	1
rule--not	1
to	1
put	1
yourself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
attacked,	1
but	1
yourself	1
to	1
attack.	1
Believe	1
me	1
in	1
war	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
often	1
shows	1
the	1
way	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
old	1
Cunctators."	1
	1
"But	1
in	1
what	1
position	1
are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
attack	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
outposts	1
today	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
say	1
where	1
his	1
chief	1
forces	1
are	1
situated,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
Dolgorukov	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
attack	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
formed.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same,"	1
Dolgorukov	1
said	1
quickly,	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
spread	1
a	1
map	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
"All	1
eventualities	1
have	1
been	1
foreseen.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
standing	1
before	1
Brunn..."	1
	1
And	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
rapidly	1
but	1
indistinctly	1
explained	1
Weyrother's	1
plan	1
of	1
a	1
flanking	1
movement.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
reply	1
and	1
to	1
state	1
his	1
own	1
plan,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
Weyrother's,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
that	1
Weyrother's	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
approved.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
began	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
plan,	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
ceased	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
gazed	1
absent-mindedly	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
map,	1
but	1
at	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
face.	1
	1
"There	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
at	1
Kutuzov's	1
tonight,	1
though;	1
you	1
can	1
say	1
all	1
this	1
there,"	1
remarked	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
do	1
so,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
moving	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
map.	1
	1
"Whatever	1
are	1
you	1
bothering	1
about,	1
gentlemen?"	1
said	1
Bilibin,	1
who,	1
till	1
then,	1
had	1
listened	1
with	1
an	1
amused	1
smile	1
to	1
their	1
conversation	1
and	1
now	1
was	1
evidently	1
ready	1
with	1
a	1
joke.	1
"Whether	1
tomorrow	1
brings	1
victory	1
or	1
defeat,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
our	1
Russian	1
arms	1
is	1
secure.	1
Except	1
your	1
Kutuzov,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
Russian	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
column!	1
The	1
commanders	1
are:	1
Herr	1
General	1
Wimpfen,	1
le	1
Comte	1
de	1
Langeron,	1
le	1
Prince	1
de	1
Lichtenstein,	1
le	1
Prince,	1
de	1
Hohenlohe,	1
and	1
finally	1
Prishprish,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
Polish	1
names."	1
	1
"Be	1
quiet,	1
backbiter!"	1
said	1
Dolgorukov.	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
true;	1
there	1
are	1
now	1
two	1
Russians,	1
Miloradovich,	1
and	1
Dokhturov,	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
third,	1
Count	1
Arakcheev,	1
if	1
his	1
nerves	1
were	1
not	1
too	1
weak."	1
	1
"However,	1
I	1
think	1
General	1
Kutuzov	1
has	1
come	1
out,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Andrew.	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
good	1
luck	1
and	1
success,	1
gentlemen!"	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
after	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
Dolgorukov	1
and	1
Bilibin.	1
	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
home,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
could	1
not	1
refrain	1
from	1
asking	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
silently	1
beside	1
him,	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
tomorrow's	1
battle.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
his	1
adjutant	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
replied:	1
"I	1
think	1
the	1
battle	1
will	1
be	1
lost,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
told	1
Count	1
Tolstoy	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
replied?	1
'But,	1
my	1
dear	1
general,	1
I	1
am	1
engaged	1
with	1
rice	1
and	1
cutlets,	1
look	1
after	1
military	1
matters	1
yourself!'	1
Yes...	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
I	1
got!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XII	1
	1
Shortly	1
after	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
that	1
evening,	1
Weyrother	1
drove	1
with	1
his	1
plans	1
to	1
Kutuzov's	1
quarters	1
where	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
held.	1
All	1
the	1
commanders	1
of	1
columns	1
were	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
Prince	1
Bagration,	1
who	1
declined	1
to	1
come,	1
were	1
all	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
	1
Weyrother,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
full	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
battle,	1
by	1
his	1
eagerness	1
and	1
briskness	1
presented	1
a	1
marked	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
dissatisfied	1
and	1
drowsy	1
Kutuzov,	1
who	1
reluctantly	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
chairman	1
and	1
president	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
Weyrother	1
evidently	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
movement	1
that	1
had	1
already	1
become	1
unrestrainable.	1
He	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
horse	1
running	1
downhill	1
harnessed	1
to	1
a	1
heavy	1
cart.	1
Whether	1
he	1
was	1
pulling	1
it	1
or	1
being	1
pushed	1
by	1
it	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
rushed	1
along	1
at	1
headlong	1
speed	1
with	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
this	1
movement	1
might	1
lead	1
to.	1
Weyrother	1
had	1
been	1
twice	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
the	1
enemy's	1
picket	1
line	1
to	1
reconnoiter	1
personally,	1
and	1
twice	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors,	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian,	1
to	1
report	1
and	1
explain,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
headquarters	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
dictated	1
the	1
dispositions	1
in	1
German,	1
and	1
now,	1
much	1
exhausted,	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
Kutuzov's.	1
	1
He	1
was	1
evidently	1
so	1
busy	1
that	1
he	1
even	1
forgot	1
to	1
be	1
polite	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief.	1
He	1
interrupted	1
him,	1
talked	1
rapidly	1
and	1
indistinctly,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was	1
addressing,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
reply	1
to	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
bespattered	1
with	1
mud	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
pitiful,	1
weary,	1
and	1
distracted	1
air,	1
though	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
haughty	1
and	1
self-confident.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
occupying	1
a	1
nobleman's	1
castle	1
of	1
modest	1
dimensions	1
near	1
Ostralitz.	1
In	1
the	1
large	1
drawing	1
room	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
commander	1
in	1
chief's	1
office	1
were	1
gathered	1
Kutuzov	1
himself,	1
Weyrother,	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war.	1
They	1
were	1
drinking	1
tea,	1
and	1
only	1
awaited	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
council.	1
At	1
last	1
Bagration's	1
orderly	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
could	1
not	1
attend.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
this	1
and,	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
permission	1
previously	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
council,	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
	1
"Since	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
is	1
not	1
coming,	1
we	1
may	1
begin,"	1
said	1
Weyrother,	1
hurriedly	1
rising	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
which	1
an	1
enormous	1
map	1
of	1
the	1
environs	1
of	1
Brunn	1
was	1
spread	1
out.	1
	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
his	1
uniform	1
unbuttoned	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
fat	1
neck	1
bulged	1
over	1
his	1
collar	1
as	1
if	1
escaping,	1
was	1
sitting	1
almost	1
asleep	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
podgy	1
old	1
hands	1
resting	1
symmetrically	1
on	1
its	1
arms.	1
At	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Weyrother's	1
voice,	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
one	1
eye	1
with	1
an	1
effort.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
if	1
you	1
please!	1
It	1
is	1
already	1
late,"	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
nodding	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
droop	1
and	1
again	1
closed	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
If	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
thought	1
that	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
pretending	1
to	1
sleep,	1
the	1
sounds	1
his	1
nose	1
emitted	1
during	1
the	1
reading	1
that	1
followed	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
commander-in-chief	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
was	1
absorbed	1
by	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
serious	1
matter	1
than	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
dispositions	1
or	1
anything	1
else--he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
satisfying	1
the	1
irresistible	1
human	1
need	1
for	1
sleep.	1
He	1
really	1
was	1
asleep.	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
gesture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
moment,	1
glanced	1
at	1
Kutuzov	1
and,	1
having	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
paper	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
monotonous	1
voice	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
out	1
the	1
dispositions	1
for	1
the	1
impending	1
battle,	1
under	1
a	1
heading	1
which	1
he	1
also	1
read	1
out:	1
	1
"Dispositions	1
for	1
an	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
enemy	1
position	1
behind	1
Kobelnitz	1
and	1
Sokolnitz,	1
November	1
30,	1
1805."	1
	1
The	1
dispositions	1
were	1
very	1
complicated	1
and	1
difficult.	1
They	1
began	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
"As	1
the	1
enemy's	1
left	1
wing	1
rests	1
on	1
wooded	1
hills	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
extends	1
along	1
Kobelnitz	1
and	1
Sokolnitz	1
behind	1
the	1
ponds	1
that	1
are	1
there,	1
while	1
we,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
with	1
our	1
left	1
wing	1
by	1
far	1
outflank	1
his	1
right,	1
it	1
is	1
advantageous	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
enemy's	1
latter	1
wing	1
especially	1
if	1
we	1
occupy	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
Sokolnitz	1
and	1
Kobelnitz,	1
whereby	1
we	1
can	1
both	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
flank	1
and	1
pursue	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
plain	1
between	1
Schlappanitz	1
and	1
the	1
Thuerassa	1
forest,	1
avoiding	1
the	1
defiles	1
of	1
Schlappanitz	1
and	1
Bellowitz	1
which	1
cover	1
the	1
enemy's	1
front.	1
For	1
this	1
object	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that...	1
The	1
first	1
column	1
marches...	1
The	1
second	1
column	1
marches...	1
The	1
third	1
column	1
marches..."	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
read	1
Weyrother.	1
	1
The	1
generals	1
seemed	1
to	1
listen	1
reluctantly	1
to	1
the	1
difficult	1
dispositions.	1
The	1
tall,	1
fair-haired	1
General	1
Buxhowden	1
stood,	1
leaning	1
his	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
burning	1
candle,	1
and	1
seemed	1
not	1
to	1
listen	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
listen.	1
Exactly	1
opposite	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
his	1
glistening	1
wide-open	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
mustache	1
twisted	1
upwards,	1
sat	1
the	1
ruddy	1
Miloradovich	1
in	1
a	1
military	1
pose,	1
his	1
elbows	1
turned	1
outwards,	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
and	1
his	1
shoulders	1
raised.	1
He	1
remained	1
stubbornly	1
silent,	1
gazing	1
at	1
Weyrother's	1
face,	1
and	1
only	1
turned	1
away	1
his	1
eyes	1
when	1
the	1
Austrian	1
chief	1
of	1
staff	1
finished	1
reading.	1
Then	1
Miloradovich	1
looked	1
round	1
significantly	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
generals.	1
But	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
from	1
that	1
significant	1
look	1
whether	1
he	1
agreed	1
or	1
disagreed	1
and	1
was	1
satisfied	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
arrangements.	1
Next	1
to	1
Weyrother	1
sat	1
Count	1
Langeron	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
subtle	1
smile	1
that	1
never	1
left	1
his	1
typically	1
southern	1
French	1
face	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
reading,	1
gazed	1
at	1
his	1
delicate	1
fingers	1
which	1
rapidly	1
twirled	1
by	1
its	1
corners	1
a	1
gold	1
snuffbox	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
portrait.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
longest	1
sentences,	1
he	1
stopped	1
the	1
rotary	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
snuffbox,	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
inimical	1
politeness	1
lurking	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
lips	1
interrupted	1
Weyrother,	1
wishing	1
to	1
say	1
something.	1
But	1
the	1
Austrian	1
general,	1
continuing	1
to	1
read,	1
frowned	1
angrily	1
and	1
jerked	1
his	1
elbows,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
say:	1
"You	1
can	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1
views	1
later,	1
but	1
now	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
map	1
and	1
listen."	1
Langeron	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
perplexity,	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
an	1
explanation,	1
but	1
meeting	1
the	1
latter's	1
impressive	1
but	1
meaningless	1
gaze	1
drooped	1
his	1
eyes	1
sadly	1
and	1
again	1
took	1
to	1
twirling	1
his	1
snuffbox.	1
	1
"A	1
geography	1
lesson!"	1
he	1
muttered	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
himself,	1
but	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
Przebyszewski,	1
with	1
respectful	1
but	1
dignified	1
politeness,	1
held	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
ear	1
toward	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
absorbed	1
in	1
attention.	1
Dohkturov,	1
a	1
little	1
man,	1
sat	1
opposite	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
an	1
assiduous	1
and	1
modest	1
mien,	1
and	1
stooping	1
over	1
the	1
outspread	1
map	1
conscientiously	1
studied	1
the	1
dispositions	1
and	1
the	1
unfamiliar	1
locality.	1
He	1
asked	1
Weyrother	1
several	1
times	1
to	1
repeat	1
words	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
clearly	1
heard	1
and	1
the	1
difficult	1
names	1
of	1
villages.	1
Weyrother	1
complied	1
and	1
Dohkturov	1
noted	1
them	1
down.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
reading	1
which	1
lasted	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
hour	1
was	1
over,	1
Langeron	1
again	1
brought	1
his	1
snuffbox	1
to	1
rest	1
and,	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Weyrother	1
or	1
at	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular,	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
difficult	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
such	1
a	1
plan	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
enemy's	1
position	1
was	1
assumed	1
to	1
be	1
known,	1
whereas	1
it	1
was	1
perhaps	1
not	1
known,	1
since	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
in	1
movement.	1
Langeron's	1
objections	1
were	1
valid	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
obvious	1
that	1
their	1
chief	1
aim	1
was	1
to	1
show	1
General	1
Weyrother--who	1
had	1
read	1
his	1
dispositions	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
self-confidence	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
addressing	1
school	1
children--that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do,	1
not	1
with	1
fools,	1
but	1
with	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
teach	1
him	1
something	1
in	1
military	1
matters.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
monotonous	1
sound	1
of	1
Weyrother's	1
voice	1
ceased,	1
Kutuzov	1
opened	1
his	1
eye	1
as	1
a	1
miller	1
wakes	1
up	1
when	1
the	1
soporific	1
drone	1
of	1
the	1
mill	1
wheel	1
is	1
interrupted.	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
Langeron	1
said,	1
as	1
if	1
remarking,	1
"So	1
you	1
are	1
still	1
at	1
that	1
silly	1
business!"	1
quickly	1
closed	1
his	1
eye	1
again,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
head	1
sink	1
still	1
lower.	1
	1
Langeron,	1
trying	1
as	1
virulently	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
sting	1
Weyrother's	1
vanity	1
as	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
plan,	1
argued	1
that	1
Bonaparte	1
might	1
easily	1
attack	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
attacked,	1
and	1
so	1
render	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
plan	1
perfectly	1
worthless.	1
Weyrother	1
met	1
all	1
objections	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
and	1
contemptuous	1
smile,	1
evidently	1
prepared	1
beforehand	1
to	1
meet	1
all	1
objections	1
be	1
they	1
what	1
they	1
might.	1
	1
"If	1
he	1
could	1
attack	1
us,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
today,"	1
said	1
he.	1
	1
"So	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
powerless?"	1
said	1
Langeron.	1
	1
"He	1
has	1
forty	1
thousand	1
men	1
at	1
most,"	1
replied	1
Weyrother,	1
with	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
a	1
doctor	1
to	1
whom	1
an	1
old	1
wife	1
wishes	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
treatment	1
of	1
a	1
case.	1
	1
"In	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
is	1
inviting	1
his	1
doom	1
by	1
awaiting	1
our	1
attack,"	1
said	1
Langeron,	1
with	1
a	1
subtly	1
ironical	1
smile,	1
again	1
glancing	1
round	1
for	1
support	1
to	1
Miloradovich	1
who	1
was	1
near	1
him.	1
	1
But	1
Miloradovich	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
evidently	1
thinking	1
of	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
generals	1
were	1
disputing	1
about.	1
	1
"Ma	1
foi!"	1
said	1
he,	1
"tomorrow	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
battlefield."	1
	1
Weyrother	1
again	1
gave	1
that	1
smile	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
strange	1
and	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
meet	1
objections	1
from	1
Russian	1
generals	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
convinced	1
himself	1
of,	1
but	1
had	1
also	1
convinced	1
the	1
sovereign	1
Emperors	1
of.	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
has	1
quenched	1
his	1
fires	1
and	1
a	1
continual	1
noise	1
is	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
camp,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
mean?	1
Either	1
he	1
is	1
retreating,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
we	1
need	1
fear,	1
or	1
he	1
is	1
changing	1
his	1
position."	1
(He	1
smiled	1
ironically.)	1
"But	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
also	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
Thuerassa,	1
he	1
merely	1
saves	1
us	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
all	1
our	1
arrangements	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
detail	1
remain	1
the	1
same."	1
	1
"How	1
is	1
that?..."	1
began	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
long	1
been	1
waiting	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
doubts.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
here	1
woke	1
up,	1
coughed	1
heavily,	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
generals.	1
	1
"Gentlemen,	1
the	1
dispositions	1
for	1
tomorrow--or	1
rather	1
for	1
today,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
past	1
midnight--cannot	1
now	1
be	1
altered,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"You	1
have	1
heard	1
them,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
do	1
our	1
duty.	1
But	1
before	1
a	1
battle,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
important..."	1
he	1
paused,	1
"than	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
sleep."	1
	1
He	1
moved	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
rise.	1
The	1
generals	1
bowed	1
and	1
retired.	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
midnight.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
went	1
out.	1
	1
The	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
at	1
which	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
express	1
his	1
opinion	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hoped	1
to,	1
left	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
vague	1
and	1
uneasy	1
impression.	1
Whether	1
Dolgorukov	1
and	1
Weyrother,	1
or	1
Kutuzov,	1
Langeron,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
attack,	1
were	1
right--he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
"But	1
was	1
it	1
really	1
not	1
possible	1
for	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
state	1
his	1
views	1
plainly	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
court	1
and	1
personal	1
considerations	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
lives,	1
and	1
my	1
life,	1
my	1
life,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
"must	1
be	1
risked?"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
killed	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
at	1
this	1
thought	1
of	1
death,	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
most	1
distant,	1
most	1
intimate,	1
memories	1
rose	1
in	1
his	1
imagination:	1
he	1
remembered	1
his	1
last	1
parting	1
from	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
wife;	1
he	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
loved	1
her.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
pregnancy	1
and	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
nervously	1
emotional	1
and	1
softened	1
mood	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hut	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
billeted	1
with	1
Nesvitski	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
before	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
foggy	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
fog	1
the	1
moonlight	1
gleamed	1
mysteriously.	1
"Yes,	1
tomorrow,	1
tomorrow!"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"Tomorrow	1
everything	1
may	1
be	1
over	1
for	1
me!	1
All	1
these	1
memories	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more,	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
have	1
any	1
meaning	1
for	1
me.	1
Tomorrow	1
perhaps,	1
even	1
certainly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
presentiment	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
show	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do."	1
And	1
his	1
fancy	1
pictured	1
the	1
battle,	1
its	1
loss,	1
the	1
concentration	1
of	1
fighting	1
at	1
one	1
point,	1
and	1
the	1
hesitation	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
commanders.	1
And	1
then	1
that	1
happy	1
moment,	1
that	1
Toulon	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
waited,	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
last.	1
He	1
firmly	1
and	1
clearly	1
expresses	1
his	1
opinion	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
to	1
Weyrother,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
All	1
are	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
his	1
views,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
undertakes	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
out,	1
so	1
he	1
takes	1
a	1
regiment,	1
a	1
division-stipulates	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
his	1
arrangements--leads	1
his	1
division	1
to	1
the	1
decisive	1
point,	1
and	1
gains	1
the	1
victory	1
alone.	1
"But	1
death	1
and	1
suffering?"	1
suggested	1
another	1
voice.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
that	1
voice	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
dreaming	1
of	1
his	1
triumphs.	1
The	1
dispositions	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
battle	1
are	1
planned	1
by	1
him	1
alone.	1
Nominally	1
he	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
adjutant	1
on	1
Kutuzov's	1
staff,	1
but	1
he	1
does	1
everything	1
alone.	1
The	1
next	1
battle	1
is	1
won	1
by	1
him	1
alone.	1
Kutuzov	1
is	1
removed	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
appointed...	1
"Well	1
and	1
then?"	1
asked	1
the	1
other	1
voice.	1
"If	1
before	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
ten	1
times	1
wounded,	1
killed,	1
or	1
betrayed,	1
well...	1
what	1
then?..."	1
"Well	1
then,"	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
answered	1
himself,	1
"I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
and	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
can't,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
this--want	1
glory,	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
men,	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
them,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
and	1
want	1
nothing	1
but	1
that	1
and	1
live	1
only	1
for	1
that.	1
Yes,	1
for	1
that	1
alone!	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
tell	1
anyone,	1
but,	1
oh	1
God!	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
I	1
love	1
nothing	1
but	1
fame	1
and	1
men's	1
esteem?	1
Death,	1
wounds,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
family--I	1
fear	1
nothing.	1
And	1
precious	1
and	1
dear	1
as	1
many	1
persons	1
are	1
to	1
me--father,	1
sister,	1
wife--those	1
dearest	1
to	1
me--yet	1
dreadful	1
and	1
unnatural	1
as	1
it	1
seems,	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
glory,	1
of	1
triumph	1
over	1
men,	1
of	1
love	1
from	1
men	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
and	1
never	1
shall	1
know,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
here,"	1
he	1
thought,	1
as	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
voices	1
in	1
Kutuzov's	1
courtyard.	1
The	1
voices	1
were	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
orderlies	1
who	1
were	1
packing	1
up;	1
one	1
voice,	1
probably	1
a	1
coachman's,	1
was	1
teasing	1
Kutuzov's	1
old	1
cook	1
whom	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
knew,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Tit.	1
He	1
was	1
saying,	1
"Tit,	1
I	1
say,	1
Tit!"	1
	1
"Well?"	1
returned	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
	1
"Go,	1
Tit,	1
thresh	1
a	1
bit!"	1
said	1
the	1
wag.	1
	1
"Oh,	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
devil!"	1
called	1
out	1
a	1
voice,	1
drowned	1
by	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
the	1
orderlies	1
and	1
servants.	1
	1
"All	1
the	1
same,	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
value	1
nothing	1
but	1
triumph	1
over	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
value	1
this	1
mystic	1
power	1
and	1
glory	1
that	1
is	1
floating	1
here	1
above	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
mist!"	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
CHAPTER	1
XIII	1
	1
That	1
same	1
night,	1
Rostov	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
platoon	1
on	1
skirmishing	1
duty	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Bagration's	1
detachment.	1
His	1
hussars	1
were	1
placed	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
in	1
couples	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
rode	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
trying	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
sleepiness	1
that	1
kept	1
coming	1
over	1
him.	1
An	1
enormous	1
space,	1
with	1
our	1
army's	1
campfires	1
dimly	1
glowing	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
behind	1
him;	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
misty	1
darkness.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
see	1
nothing,	1
peer	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
into	1
that	1
foggy	1
distance:	1
now	1
something	1
gleamed	1
gray,	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
black,	1
now	1
little	1
lights	1
seemed	1
to	1
glimmer	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
now	1
he	1
fancied	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
eyes.	1
His	1
eyes	1
kept	1
closing,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
fancy	1
appeared--now	1
the	1
Emperor,	1
now	1
Denisov,	1
and	1
now	1
Moscow	1
memories--and	1
he	1
again	1
hurriedly	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
close	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
he	1
was	1
riding,	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
within	1
six	1
paces	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
black	1
figures	1
of	1
hussars,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
misty	1
darkness.	1
"Why	1
not?...	1
It	1
might	1
easily	1
happen,"	1
thought	1
Rostov,	1
"that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
will	1
meet	1
me	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
order	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
officer;	1
he'll	1
say:	1
'Go	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
what's	1
there.'	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
stories	1
of	1
his	1
getting	1
to	1
know	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
chance	1
way	1
and	1
attaching	1
him	1
to	1
himself!	1
What	1
if	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
place	1
near	1
him?	1
Oh,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
guard	1
him,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
truth,	1
how	1
I	1
would	1
unmask	1
his	1
deceivers!"	1
And	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
realize	1
vividly	1
his	1
love	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
Rostov	1
pictured	1
to	1
himself	1
an	1
enemy	1
or	1
a	1
deceitful	1
German,	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
kill	1
with	1
pleasure	1
but	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
slap	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
Suddenly	1
a	1
distant	1
shout	1
aroused	1
him.	1
He	1
started	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
"Where	1
am	1
I?	1
Oh	1
yes,	1
in	1
the	1
skirmishing	1
line...	1
pass	1
and	1
watchword--	1
shaft,	1
Olmutz.	1
What	1
a	1
nuisance	1
that	1
our	1
squadron	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
reserve	1
tomorrow,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"I'll	1
ask	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
front,	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
my	1
only	1
chance	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
It	1
won't	1
be	1
long	1
now	1
before	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
duty.	1
I'll	1
take	1
another	1
turn	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
get	1
back	1
I'll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
ask	1
him."	1
He	1
readjusted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
touched	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
ride	1
once	1
more	1
round	1
his	1
hussars.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
getting	1
lighter.	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
sloping	1
descent	1
lit	1
up,	1
and	1
facing	1
it	1
a	1
black	1
knoll	1
that	1
seemed	1
as	1
steep	1
as	1
a	1
wall.	1
On	1
this	1
knoll	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
patch	1
that	1
Rostov	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
make	1
out:	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
glade	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
lit	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
or	1
some	1
unmelted	1
snow,	1
or	1
some	1
white	1
houses?	1
He	1
even	1
thought	1
something	1
moved	1
on	1
that	1
white	1
spot.	1
"I	1
expect	1
it's	1
snow...	1
that	1
spot...	1
a	1
spot--une	1
tache,"	1
he	1
thought.	1
"There	1
now...	1
it's	1
not	1
a	1
tache...	1
Natasha...	1
sister,	1
black	1
eyes...	1
Na...	1
tasha...	1
(Won't	1
she	1
be	1
surprised	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
her	1
how	1
I've	1
seen	1
the	1
Emperor?)	1
Natasha...	1
take	1
my	1
sabretache..."--"Keep	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
your	1
honor,	1
there	1
are	1
bushes	1
here,"	1
came	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
hussar,	1
past	1
whom	1
Rostov	1
was	1
riding	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
falling	1
asleep.	1
Rostov	1
lifted	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
had	1
sunk	1
almost	1
to	1
his	1
horse's	1
mane	1
and	1
pulled	1
up	1
beside	1
the	1
hussar.	1
He	1
was	1
succumbing	1
to	1
irresistible,	1
youthful,	1
childish	1
drowsiness.	1
"But	1
what	1
was	1
I	1
thinking?	1
I	1
mustn't	1
forget.	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor?	1
No,	1
that's	1
not	1
it--that's	1
tomorrow.	1
Oh	1
yes!	1
Natasha...	1
sabretache...	1
saber	1
them...	1
Whom?	1
The	1
hussars...	1
Ah,	1
the	1
hussars	1
with	1
mustaches.	1
Along	1
the	1
Tverskaya	1
Street	1
rode	1
the	1
hussar	1
with	1
mustaches...	1
I	1
thought	1
about	1
him	1
too,	1
just	1
opposite	1
Guryev's	1
house...	1
Old	1
Guryev....	1
Oh,	1
but	1
Denisov's	1
a	1
fine	1
fellow.	1
But	1
that's	1
all	1
nonsense.	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
Emperor	1
is	1
here.	1
How	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
me	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something,	1
but	1
dared	1
not....	1
No,	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
who	1
dared	1
not.	1
But	1
that's	1
nonsense,	1
the	1
chief	1
thing	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
important	1
thing	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of.	1
Yes,	1
Na-tasha,	1
sabretache,	1
oh,	1
yes,	1
yes!	1
That's	1
right!"	1
And	1
his	1
head	1
once	1
more	1
sank	1
to	1
his	1
horse's	1
neck.	1
All	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
fired	1
at.	1
"What?	1
What?	1
What?...	1
Cut	1
them	1
down!	1
What?..."	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
waking	1
up.	1
At	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
heard	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
where	1
the	1
enemy	1
was,	1
the	1
long-drawn	1
shouts	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
voices.	1
His	1
horse	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
hussar	1
near	1
him	1
pricked	1
their	1
ears	1
at	1
these	1
shouts.	1
Over	1
there,	1
where	1
the	1
shouting	1
came	1
from,	1
a	1
fire	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
again,	1
then	1
another,	1
and	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
French	1
line	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
fires	1
flared	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
shouting	1
grew	1
louder	1
and	1
louder.	1
Rostov	1
could	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
French	1
words	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
them.	1
The	1
din	1
of	1
many	1
voices	1
was	1
too	1
great;	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
was:	1
"ahahah!"	1
and	1
"rrrr!"	1
	1
"What's	1
that?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
it?"	1
said	1
Rostov	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
beside	1
him.	1
"That	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp!"	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Why,	1
don't	1
you	1
hear	1
it?"	1
Rostov	1
asked	1
again,	1
after	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply.	1
	1
"Who	1
can	1
tell,	1
your	1
honor?"	1
replied	1
the	1
hussar	1
reluctantly.	1
	1
"From	1
the	1
direction,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
enemy,"	1
repeated	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
he	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
nothing,"	1
muttered	1
the	1
hussar.	1
"It's	1
dark...	1
Steady!"	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
his	1
fidgeting	1
horse.	1
	1
Rostov's	1
horse	1
was	1
also	1
getting	1
restive:	1
it	1
pawed	1
the	1
frozen	1
ground,	1
pricking	1
its	1
ears	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
lights.	1
The	1
shouting	1
grew	1
still	1
louder	1
and	1
merged	1
into	1
a	1
general	1
roar	1
that	1
only	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
several	1
thousand	1
men	1
could	1
produce.	1
The	1
lights	1
spread	1
farther	1
and	1
farther,	1
probably	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
camp.	1
Rostov	1
no	1
longer	1
wanted	1
to	1
sleep.	1
The	1
gay	1
triumphant	1
shouting	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
army	1
had	1
a	1
stimulating	1
effect	1
on	1
him.	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!	1
L'Empereur!"	1
he	1
now	1
heard	1
distinctly.	1
	1
"They	1
can't	1
be	1
far	1
off,	1
probably	1
just	1
beyond	1
the	1
stream,"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
hussar	1
beside	1
him.	1
	1
The	1
hussar	1
only	1
sighed	1
without	1
replying	1
and	1
coughed	1
angrily.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
horse's	1
hoofs	1
approaching	1
at	1
a	1
trot	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
hussars	1
was	1
heard,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foggy	1
darkness	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
sergeant	1
of	1
hussars	1
suddenly	1
appeared,	1
looming	1
huge	1
as	1
an	1
elephant.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
the	1
generals!"	1
said	1
the	1
sergeant,	1
riding	1
up	1
to	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Rostov,	1
still	1
looking	1
round	1
toward	1
the	1
fires	1
and	1
the	1
shouts,	1
rode	1
with	1
the	1
sergeant	1
to	1
meet	1
some	1
mounted	1
men	1
who	1
were	1
riding	1
along	1
the	1
line.	1
One	1
was	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
horse.	1
Prince	1
Bagration	1
and	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov	1
with	1
their	1
adjutants	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
curious	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
the	1
lights	1
and	1
shouts	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
camp.	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Bagration,	1
reported	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
joined	1
the	1
adjutants	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
generals	1
were	1
saying.	1
	1
"Believe	1
me,"	1
said	1
Prince	1
Dolgorukov,	1
addressing	1
Bagration,	1
"it	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
trick!	1
He	1
has	1
retreated	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
rearguard	1
to	1
kindle	1
fires	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
to	1
deceive	1
us."	1
	1
"Hardly,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"I	1
saw	1
them	1
this	1
evening	1
on	1
that	1
knoll;	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
retreated	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
that	1
too....	1
Officer!"	1
said	1
Bagration	1
to	1
Rostov,	1
"are	1
the	1
enemy's	1
skirmishers	1
still	1
there?"	1
	1
"They	1
were	1
there	1
this	1
evening,	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
don't	1
know,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
Shall	1
I	1
go	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
hussars	1
to	1
see?"	1
replied	1
Rostov.	1
	1
Bagration	1
stopped	1
and,	1
before	1
replying,	1
tried	1
to	1
see	1
Rostov's	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mist.	1
	1
"Well,	1
go	1
and	1
see,"	1
he	1
said,	1
after	1
a	1
pause.	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
Rostov	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse,	1
called	1
to	1
Sergeant	1
Fedchenko	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
hussars,	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
and	1
trotted	1
downhill	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
shouting	1
came.	1
He	1
felt	1
both	1
frightened	1
and	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
riding	1
alone	1
with	1
three	1
hussars	1
into	1
that	1
mysterious	1
and	1
dangerous	1
misty	1
distance	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
him.	1
Bagration	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hill	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
beyond	1
the	1
stream,	1
but	1
Rostov	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
but	1
rode	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
continually	1
mistaking	1
bushes	1
for	1
trees	1
and	1
gullies	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
continually	1
discovering	1
his	1
mistakes.	1
Having	1
descended	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
trot,	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
saw	1
either	1
our	1
own	1
or	1
the	1
enemy's	1
fires,	1
but	1
heard	1
the	1
shouting	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
more	1
loudly	1
and	1
distinctly.	1
In	1
the	1
valley	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
river,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
reached	1
it	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
road.	1
Having	1
come	1
out	1
onto	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
hesitating	1
whether	1
to	1
ride	1
along	1
it	1
or	1
cross	1
it	1
and	1
ride	1
over	1
the	1
black	1
field	1
up	1
the	1
hillside.	1
To	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
which	1
gleamed	1
white	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
safer	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easier	1
to	1
see	1
people	1
coming	1
along	1
it.	1
"Follow	1
me!"	1
said	1
he,	1
crossed	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
began	1
riding	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
at	1
a	1
gallop	1
toward	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
the	1
French	1
pickets	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
that	1
evening.	1
	1
"Your	1
honor,	1
there	1
he	1
is!"	1
cried	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hussars	1
behind	1
him.	1
And	1
before	1
Rostov	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
the	1
black	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
flash,	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
report,	1
and	1
a	1
bullet	1
whizzing	1
high	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
mist	1
with	1
a	1
plaintive	1
sound	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
hearing.	1
Another	1
musket	1
missed	1
fire	1
but	1
flashed	1
in	1
the	1
pan.	1
Rostov	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
galloped	1
back.	1
Four	1
more	1
reports	1
followed	1
at	1
intervals,	1
and	1
the	1
bullets	1
passed	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
singing	1
in	1
different	1
tones.	1
Rostov	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse,	1
whose	1
spirits	1
had	1
risen,	1
like	1
his	1
own,	1
at	1
the	1
firing,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
at	1
a	1
footpace.	1
"Well,	1
some	1
more!	1
Some	1
more!"	1
a	1
merry	1
voice	1
was	1
saying	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
But	1
no	1
more	1
shots	1
came.	1
	1
Only	1
when	1
approaching	1
Bagration	1
did	1
Rostov	1
let	1
his	1
horse	1
gallop	1
again,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
Dolgorukov	1
was	1
still	1
insisting	1
that	1
the	1
French	1
had	1
retreated	1
and	1
had	1
only	1
lit	1
fires	1
to	1
deceive	1
us.	1
	1
"What	1
does	1
that	1
prove?"	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
as	1
Rostov	1
rode	1
up.	1
"They	1
might	1
retreat	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
pickets."	1
	1
"It's	1
plain	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
gone	1
yet,	1
Prince,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"Wait	1
till	1
tomorrow	1
morning,	1
we'll	1
find	1
out	1
everything	1
tomorrow."	1
	1
"The	1
picket	1
is	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
hill,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
just	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
evening,"	1
reported	1
Rostov,	1
stooping	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
the	1
salute	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
repress	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
induced	1
by	1
his	1
ride	1
and	1
especially	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bullets.	1
	1
"Very	1
good,	1
very	1
good,"	1
said	1
Bagration.	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
officer."	1
	1
"Your	1
excellency,"	1
said	1
Rostov,	1
"may	1
I	1
ask	1
a	1
favor?"	1
	1
"What	1
is	1
it?"	1
	1
"Tomorrow	1
our	1
squadron	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
reserve.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
to	1
be	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
squadron?"	1
	1
"What's	1
your	1
name?"	1
	1
"Count	1
Rostov."	1
	1
"Oh,	1
very	1
well,	1
you	1
may	1
stay	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
me."	1
	1
"Count	1
Ilya	1
Rostov's	1
son?"	1
asked	1
Dolgorukov.	1
	1
But	1
Rostov	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
	1
"Then	1
I	1
may	1
reckon	1
on	1
it,	1
your	1
excellency?"	1
	1
"I	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
order."	1
	1
"Tomorrow	1
very	1
likely	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
sent	1
with	1
some	1
message	1
to	1
the	1
Emperor,"	1
thought	1
Rostov.	1
	1
"Thank	1
God!"	1
	1
The	1
fires	1
and	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
enemy's	1
army	1
were	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
while	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
was	1
being	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
troops	1
the	1
Emperor	1
himself	1
rode	1
round	1
his	1
bivouacs.	1
The	1
soldiers,	1
on	1
seeing	1
him,	1
lit	1
wisps	1
of	1
straw	1
and	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
shouting,	1
"Vive	1
l'Empereur!"	1
Napoleon's	1
proclamation	1
was	1
as	1
follows:	1
	1
Soldiers!	1
The	1
Russian	1
army	1
is	1
advancing	1
against	1
you	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
Austrian	1
army	1
of	1
Ulm.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
battalions	1
you	1
broke	1
at	1
Hollabrunn	1
and	1
have	1
pursued	1
ever	1
since	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
The	1
position	1
we	1
occupy	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
one,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
marching	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
they	1
will	1
expose	1
a	1
flank	1
to	1
me.	1
Soldiers!	1
I	1
will	1
myself	1
direct	1
your	1
battalions.	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
fire	1
if	1
you	1
with	1
your	1
habitual	1
valor	1
carry	1
disorder	1
and	1
confusion	1
into	1
the	1
enemy's	1
ranks,	1
but	1
should	1
victory	1
be	1
in	1
doubt,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
your	1
Emperor	1
exposing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
for	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
victory,	1
especially	1
on	1
this	1
day	1
when	1
what	1
is	1
at	1
stake	1
is	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
infantry,	1
so	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
our	1
nation.	1
	1
Do	1
not	1
break	1
your	1
ranks	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
removing	1
the	1
wounded!	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
imbued	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
defeat	1
these	1
hirelings	1
of	1
England,	1
inspired	1
by	1
such	1
hatred	1
of	1
our	1
nation!	1
This	1
victory	1
will	1
conclude	1
our	1
campaign	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
return	1
to	1
winter	1
quarters,	1
where	1
fresh	1
French	1
troops	1
who	1
are	1
being	1
raised	1
in	1
France	1
will	1
join	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
I	1
shall	1
conclude	1
will	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
of	1
myself.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIV	1
	1
At	1
five	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
quite	1
dark.	1
The	1
troops	1
of	1
the	1
center,	1
the	1
reserves,	1
and	1
Bagration's	1
right	1
flank	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
moved,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
flank	1
the	1
columns	1
of	1
infantry,	1
cavalry,	1
and	1
artillery,	1
which	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
descend	1
the	1
heights	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
French	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
drive	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
Bohemian	1
mountains	1
according	1
to	1
plan,	1
were	1
already	1
up	1
and	1
astir.	1
The	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
campfires,	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
throwing	1
everything	1
superfluous,	1
made	1
the	1
eyes	1
smart.	1
It	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
dark.	1
The	1
officers	1
were	1
hurriedly	1
drinking	1
tea	1
and	1
breakfasting,	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
munching	1
biscuit	1
and	1
beating	1
a	1
tattoo	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
to	1
warm	1
themselves,	1
gathering	1
round	1
the	1
fires	1
throwing	1
into	1
the	1
flames	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
sheds,	1
chairs,	1
tables,	1
wheels,	1
tubs,	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
or	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
away	1
with	1
them.	1
Austrian	1
column	1
guides	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
and	1
served	1
as	1
heralds	1
of	1
the	1
advance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
an	1
Austrian	1
officer	1
showed	1
himself	1
near	1
a	1
commanding	1
officer's	1
quarters,	1
the	1
regiment	1
began	1
to	1
move:	1
the	1
soldiers	1
ran	1
from	1
the	1
fires,	1
thrust	1
their	1
pipes	1
into	1
their	1
boots,	1
their	1
bags	1
into	1
the	1
carts,	1
got	1
their	1
muskets	1
ready,	1
and	1
formed	1
rank.	1
The	1
officers	1
buttoned	1
up	1
their	1
coats,	1
buckled	1
on	1
their	1
swords	1
and	1
pouches,	1
and	1
moved	1
along	1
the	1
ranks	1
shouting.	1
The	1
train	1
drivers	1
and	1
orderlies	1
harnessed	1
and	1
packed	1
the	1
wagons	1
and	1
tied	1
on	1
the	1
loads.	1
The	1
adjutants	1
and	1
battalion	1
and	1
regimental	1
commanders	1
mounted,	1
crossed	1
themselves,	1
gave	1
final	1
instructions,	1
orders,	1
and	1
commissions	1
to	1
the	1
baggage	1
men	1
who	1
remained	1
behind,	1
and	1
the	1
monotonous	1
tramp	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
feet	1
resounded.	1
The	1
column	1
moved	1
forward	1
without	1
knowing	1
where	1
and	1
unable,	1
from	1
the	1
masses	1
around	1
them,	1
the	1
smoke	1
and	1
the	1
increasing	1
fog,	1
to	1
see	1
either	1
the	1
place	1
they	1
were	1
leaving	1
or	1
that	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
going.	1
	1
A	1
soldier	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
is	1
hemmed	1
in	1
and	1
borne	1
along	1
by	1
his	1
regiment	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
is	1
by	1
his	1
ship.	1
However	1
far	1
he	1
has	1
walked,	1
whatever	1
strange,	1
unknown,	1
and	1
dangerous	1
places	1
he	1
reaches,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
sailor	1
is	1
always	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
decks,	1
masts,	1
and	1
rigging	1
of	1
his	1
ship,	1
so	1
the	1
soldier	1
always	1
has	1
around	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
comrades,	1
the	1
same	1
ranks,	1
the	1
same	1
sergeant	1
major	1
Ivan	1
Mitrich,	1
the	1
same	1
company	1
dog	1
Jack,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
commanders.	1
The	1
sailor	1
rarely	1
cares	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
latitude	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
ship	1
is	1
sailing,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle--heaven	1
knows	1
how	1
and	1
whence--a	1
stern	1
note	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
are	1
conscious	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
moral	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
an	1
army,	1
announcing	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
something	1
decisive	1
and	1
solemn,	1
and	1
awakening	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
an	1
unusual	1
curiosity.	1
On	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle	1
the	1
soldiers	1
excitedly	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
beyond	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
regiment,	1
they	1
listen	1
intently,	1
look	1
about,	1
and	1
eagerly	1
ask	1
concerning	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
them.	1
	1
The	1
fog	1
had	1
grown	1
so	1
dense	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
growing	1
light	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
ten	1
paces	1
ahead.	1
Bushes	1
looked	1
like	1
gigantic	1
trees	1
and	1
level	1
ground	1
like	1
cliffs	1
and	1
slopes.	1
Anywhere,	1
on	1
any	1
side,	1
one	1
might	1
encounter	1
an	1
enemy	1
invisible	1
ten	1
paces	1
off.	1
But	1
the	1
columns	1
advanced	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fog,	1
descending	1
and	1
ascending	1
hills,	1
avoiding	1
gardens	1
and	1
enclosures,	1
going	1
over	1
new	1
and	1
unknown	1
ground,	1
and	1
nowhere	1
encountering	1
the	1
enemy.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
soldiers	1
became	1
aware	1
that	1
in	1
front,	1
behind,	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
other	1
Russian	1
columns	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction.	1
Every	1
soldier	1
felt	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
unknown	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
going,	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
our	1
men	1
were	1
going	1
too.	1
	1
"There	1
now,	1
the	1
Kurskies	1
have	1
also	1
gone	1
past,"	1
was	1
being	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
ranks.	1
	1
"It's	1
wonderful	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
have	1
gathered,	1
lads!	1
Last	1
night	1
I	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
campfires	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
them.	1
A	1
regular	1
Moscow!"	1
	1
Though	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
commanders	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ranks	1
or	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
(the	1
commanders,	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
war,	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
humor	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
not	1
exert	1
themselves	1
to	1
cheer	1
the	1
men	1
but	1
merely	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
orders),	1
yet	1
the	1
troops	1
marched	1
gaily,	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
do	1
when	1
going	1
into	1
action,	1
especially	1
to	1
an	1
attack.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
marched	1
for	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
fog,	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
to	1
halt	1
and	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
consciousness	1
of	1
some	1
dislocation	1
and	1
blunder	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
ranks.	1
How	1
such	1
a	1
consciousness	1
is	1
communicated	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
define,	1
but	1
it	1
certainly	1
is	1
communicated	1
very	1
surely,	1
and	1
flows	1
rapidly,	1
imperceptibly,	1
and	1
irrepressibly,	1
as	1
water	1
does	1
in	1
a	1
creek.	1
Had	1
the	1
Russian	1
army	1
been	1
alone	1
without	1
any	1
allies,	1
it	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
this	1
consciousness	1
of	1
mismanagement	1
became	1
a	1
general	1
conviction,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
the	1
disorder	1
was	1
readily	1
and	1
naturally	1
attributed	1
to	1
the	1
stupid	1
Germans,	1
and	1
everyone	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
a	1
dangerous	1
muddle	1
had	1
been	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
sausage	1
eaters.	1
	1
"Why	1
have	1
we	1
stopped?	1
Is	1
the	1
way	1
blocked?	1
Or	1
have	1
we	1
already	1
come	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
French?"	1
	1
"No,	1
one	1
can't	1
hear	1
them.	1
They'd	1
be	1
firing	1
if	1
we	1
had."	1
	1
"They	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
enough	1
to	1
start	1
us,	1
and	1
now	1
here	1
we	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field	1
without	1
rhyme	1
or	1
reason.	1
It's	1
all	1
those	1
damned	1
Germans'	1
muddling!	1
What	1
stupid	1
devils!"	1
	1
"Yes,	1
I'd	1
send	1
them	1
on	1
in	1
front,	1
but	1
no	1
fear,	1
they're	1
crowding	1
up	1
behind.	1
And	1
now	1
here	1
we	1
stand	1
hungry."	1
	1
"I	1
say,	1
shall	1
we	1
soon	1
be	1
clear?	1
They	1
say	1
the	1
cavalry	1
are	1
blocking	1
the	1
way,"	1
said	1
an	1
officer.	1
	1
"Ah,	1
those	1
damned	1
Germans!	1
They	1
don't	1
know	1
their	1
own	1
country!"	1
said	1
another.	1
	1
"What	1
division	1
are	1
you?"	1
shouted	1
an	1
adjutant,	1
riding	1
up.	1
	1
"The	1
Eighteenth."	1
	1
"Then	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
here?	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
long	1
ago,	1
now	1
you	1
won't	1
get	1
there	1
till	1
evening."	1
	1
"What	1
stupid	1
orders!	1
They	1
don't	1
themselves	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
doing!"	1
said	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
rode	1
off.	1
	1
Then	1
a	1
general	1
rode	1
past	1
shouting	1
something	1
angrily,	1
not	1
in	1
Russian.	1
	1
"Tafa-lafa!	1
But	1
what	1
he's	1
jabbering	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
out,"	1
said	1
a	1
soldier,	1
mimicking	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
away.	1
"I'd	1
shoot	1
them,	1
the	1
scoundrels!"	1
	1
"We	1
were	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
before	1
nine,	1
but	1
we	1
haven't	1
got	1
halfway.	1
Fine	1
orders!"	1
was	1
being	1
repeated	1
on	1
different	1
sides.	1
	1
And	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
energy	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
started	1
began	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
vexation	1
and	1
anger	1
at	1
the	1
stupid	1
arrangements	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
Germans.	1
	1
The	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
confusion	1
was	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
Austrian	1
cavalry	1
was	1
moving	1
toward	1
our	1
left	1
flank,	1
the	1
higher	1
command	1
found	1
that	1
our	1
center	1
was	1
too	1
far	1
separated	1
from	1
our	1
right	1
flank	1
and	1
the	1
cavalry	1
were	1
all	1
ordered	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
Several	1
thousand	1
cavalry	1
crossed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
infantry,	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
wait.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
front	1
an	1
altercation	1
occurred	1
between	1
an	1
Austrian	1
guide	1
and	1
a	1
Russian	1
general.	1
The	1
general	1
shouted	1
a	1
demand	1
that	1
the	1
cavalry	1
should	1
be	1
halted,	1
the	1
Austrian	1
argued	1
that	1
not	1
he,	1
but	1
the	1
higher	1
command,	1
was	1
to	1
blame.	1
The	1
troops	1
meanwhile	1
stood	1
growing	1
listless	1
and	1
dispirited.	1
After	1
an	1
hour's	1
delay	1
they	1
at	1
last	1
moved	1
on,	1
descending	1
the	1
hill.	1
The	1
fog	1
that	1
was	1
dispersing	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
lay	1
still	1
more	1
densely	1
below,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
descending.	1
In	1
front	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
a	1
shot	1
was	1
heard	1
and	1
then	1
another,	1
at	1
first	1
irregularly	1
at	1
varying	1
intervals--trata...	1
tat--and	1
then	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
regularly	1
and	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
the	1
action	1
at	1
the	1
Goldbach	1
Stream	1
began.	1
	1
Not	1
expecting	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
the	1
enemy	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
stream,	1
and	1
having	1
stumbled	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
hearing	1
no	1
encouraging	1
word	1
from	1
their	1
commanders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
late	1
spreading	1
through	1
the	1
ranks,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
see	1
anything	1
in	1
front	1
or	1
around	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
fog,	1
the	1
Russians	1
exchanged	1
shots	1
with	1
the	1
enemy	1
lazily	1
and	1
advanced	1
and	1
again	1
halted,	1
receiving	1
no	1
timely	1
orders	1
from	1
the	1
officers	1
or	1
adjutants	1
who	1
wandered	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
in	1
those	1
unknown	1
surroundings	1
unable	1
to	1
find	1
their	1
own	1
regiments.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
action	1
began	1
for	1
the	1
first,	1
second,	1
and	1
third	1
columns,	1
which	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
The	1
fourth	1
column,	1
with	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
was,	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights.	1
	1
Below,	1
where	1
the	1
fight	1
was	1
beginning,	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
thick	1
fog;	1
on	1
the	1
higher	1
ground	1
it	1
was	1
clearing,	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
front.	1
Whether	1
all	1
the	1
enemy	1
forces	1
were,	1
as	1
we	1
supposed,	1
six	1
miles	1
away,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
by	1
in	1
that	1
sea	1
of	1
mist,	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
till	1
after	1
eight	1
o'clock.	1
	1
It	1
was	1
nine	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
The	1
fog	1
lay	1
unbroken	1
like	1
a	1
sea	1
down	1
below,	1
but	1
higher	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Schlappanitz	1
where	1
Napoleon	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
marshals	1
around	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
light.	1
Above	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
clear	1
blue	1
sky,	1
and	1
the	1
sun's	1
vast	1
orb	1
quivered	1
like	1
a	1
huge	1
hollow,	1
crimson	1
float	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
that	1
milky	1
sea	1
of	1
mist.	1
The	1
whole	1
French	1
army,	1
and	1
even	1
Napoleon	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
staff,	1
were	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
streams	1
and	1
hollows	1
of	1
Sokolnitz	1
and	1
Schlappanitz	1
beyond	1
which	1
we	1
intended	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
our	1
position	1
and	1
begin	1
the	1
action,	1
but	1
were	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
forces	1
that	1
Napoleon	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
eye	1
could	1
distinguish	1
a	1
mounted	1
man	1
from	1
one	1
on	1
foot.	1
Napoleon,	1
in	1
the	1
blue	1
cloak	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
worn	1
on	1
his	1
Italian	1
campaign,	1
sat	1
on	1
his	1
small	1
gray	1
Arab	1
horse	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
marshals.	1
He	1
gazed	1
silently	1
at	1
the	1
hills	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
mist	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Russian	1
troops	1
were	1
moving	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing	1
in	1
the	1
valley.	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
face--which	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
was	1
still	1
thin--moved.	1
His	1
gleaming	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
intently	1
on	1
one	1
spot.	1
His	1
predictions	1
were	1
being	1
justified.	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
force	1
had	1
already	1
descended	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
toward	1
the	1
ponds	1
and	1
lakes	1
and	1
part	1
were	1
leaving	1
these	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
which	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
position.	1
He	1
saw	1
over	1
the	1
mist	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
hollow	1
between	1
two	1
hills	1
near	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen,	1
the	1
Russian	1
columns,	1
their	1
bayonets	1
glittering,	1
were	1
moving	1
continuously	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
toward	1
the	1
valley	1
and	1
disappearing	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
into	1
the	1
mist.	1
From	1
information	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
from	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
wheels	1
and	1
footsteps	1
heard	1
by	1
the	1
outposts	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
by	1
the	1
disorderly	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
columns,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
indications,	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
allies	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
columns	1
moving	1
near	1
Pratzen	1
constituted	1
the	1
center	1
of	1
the	1
Russian	1
army,	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
center	1
was	1
already	1
sufficiently	1
weakened	1
to	1
be	1
successfully	1
attacked.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
the	1
engagement.	1
	1
Today	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
day	1
for	1
him--the	1
anniversary	1
of	1
his	1
coronation.	1
Before	1
dawn	1
he	1
had	1
slept	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
and	1
refreshed,	1
vigorous,	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
spirits,	1
he	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
field	1
in	1
that	1
happy	1
mood	1
in	1
which	1
everything	1
seems	1
possible	1
and	1
everything	1
succeeds.	1
He	1
sat	1
motionless,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
heights	1
visible	1
above	1
the	1
mist,	1
and	1
his	1
cold	1
face	1
wore	1
that	1
special	1
look	1
of	1
confident,	1
self-complacent	1
happiness	1
that	1
one	1
sees	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
happily	1
in	1
love.	1
The	1
marshals	1
stood	1
behind	1
him	1
not	1
venturing	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
attention.	1
He	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
Pratzen	1
Heights,	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
floating	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mist.	1
	1
When	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
entirely	1
emerged	1
from	1
the	1
fog,	1
and	1
fields	1
and	1
mist	1
were	1
aglow	1
with	1
dazzling	1
light--as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
awaited	1
this	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
action--he	1
drew	1
the	1
glove	1
from	1
his	1
shapely	1
white	1
hand,	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
marshals,	1
and	1
ordered	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
begin.	1
The	1
marshals,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
adjutants,	1
galloped	1
off	1
in	1
different	1
directions,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
the	1
chief	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
army	1
moved	1
rapidly	1
toward	1
those	1
Pratzen	1
Heights	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
denuded	1
by	1
Russian	1
troops	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
their	1
left.	1
	1

	1
CHAPTER	1
XV	1
	1
At	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
Kutuzov	1
rode	1
to	1
Pratzen	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
column,	1
Miloradovich's,	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
Przebyszewski's	1
and	1
Langeron's	1
columns	1
which	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley.	1
He	1
greeted	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
foremost	1
regiment	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
march,	1
thereby	1
indicating	1
that	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
lead	1
that	1
column	1
himself.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Pratzen	1
he	1
halted.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
was	1
behind,	1
among	1
the	1
immense	1
number	1
forming	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
suite.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
suppressed	1
excitement	1
and	1
irritation,	1
though	1
controlledly	1
calm	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
a	1
long-awaited	1
moment.	1
He	1
was	1
firmly	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
Toulon,	1
or	1
his	1
bridge	1
of	1
Arcola.	1
How	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
about	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
so.	1
The	1
locality	1
and	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
our	1
troops	1
were	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
anyone	1
in	1
our	1
army.	1
His	1
own	1
strategic	1
plan,	1
which	1
obviously	1
could	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
was	1
forgotten.	1
Now,	1
entering	1
into	1
Weyrother's	1
plan,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
considered	1
possible	1
contingencies	1
and	1
formed	1
new	1
projects	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
call	1
for	1
his	1
rapidity	1
of	1
perception	1
and	1
decision.	1
	1
To	1
the	1
left	1
down	1
below	1
in	1
the	1
mist,	1
the	1
musketry	1
fire	1
of	1
unseen	1
forces	1
could	1
be	1
heard.	1
It	1
was	1
there	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
thought	1
the	1
fight	1
would	1
concentrate.	1
"There	1
we	1
shall	1
encounter	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
there,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
sent	1
with	1
a	1
brigade	1
or	1
division,	1
and	1
there,	1
standard	1
in	1
hand,	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
forward	1
and	1
break	1
whatever	1
is	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me."	1
	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
calmly	1
at	1
the	1
standards	1
of	1
the	1
passing	1
battalions.	1
Seeing	1
them	1
he	1
kept	1
thinking,	1
"That	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
standard	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
lead	1
the	1
army."	1
	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
mist	1
on	1
the	1
heights	1
was	1
a	1
hoar	1
frost	1
now	1
turning	1
to	1
dew,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
valleys	1
it	1
still	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
milk-white	1
sea.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
into	1
which	1
our	1
troops	1
had	1
descended	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
came	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
firing.	1
Above	1
the	1
heights	1
was	1
the	1
dark	1
clear	1
sky,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
the	1
vast	1
orb	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
In	1
front,	1
far	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
farther	1
shore	1
of	1
that	1
sea	1
of	1
mist,	1
some	1
wooded	1
hills	1
were	1
discernible,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
the	1
enemy	1
probably	1
was,	1
for	1
something	1
could	1
be	1
descried.	1
On	1
the	1
right	1
the	1
Guards	1
were	1
entering	1
the	1
misty	1
region	1
with	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
hoofs	1
and	1
wheels	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
bayonets;	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
beyond	1
the	1
village	1
similar	1
masses	1
of	1
cavalry	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
disappeared	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
mist.	1
In	1
front	1
and	1
behind	1
moved	1
infantry.	1
The	1
commander-in-chief	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
letting	1
the	1
troops	1
pass	1
by	1
him.	1
That	1
morning	1
Kutuzov	1
seemed	1
worn	1
and	1
irritable.	1
The	1
infantry	1
passing	1
before	1
him	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
without	1
any	1
command	1
being	1
given,	1
apparently	1
obstructed	1
by	1
something	1
in	1
front.	1
	1
"Do	1
order	1
them	1
to	1
form	1
into	1
battalion	1
columns	1
and	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
village!"	1
he	1
said	1
angrily	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who	1
had	1
ridden	1
up.	1
"Don't	1
you	1
understand,	1
your	1
excellency,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
defile	1
through	1
narrow	1
village	1
streets	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
marching	1
against	1
the	1
enemy?"	1
	1
"I	1
intended	1
to	1
re-form	1
them	1
beyond	1
the	1
village,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
answered	1
the	1
general.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
laughed	1
bitterly.	1
	1
"You'll	1
make	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
of	1
it,	1
deploying	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
enemy!	1
Very	1
fine!"	1
	1
"The	1
enemy	1
is	1
still	1
far	1
away,	1
your	1
excellency.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
dispositions..."	1
	1
"The	1
dispositions!"	1
exclaimed	1
Kutuzov	1
bitterly.	1
"Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?...	1
Kindly	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
ordered."	1
	1
"Yes,	1
sir."	1
	1
"My	1
dear	1
fellow,"	1
Nesvitski	1
whispered	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
"the	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
as	1
surly	1
as	1
a	1
dog."	1
	1
An	1
Austrian	1
officer	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
with	1
green	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
galloped	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
name	1
had	1
the	1
fourth	1
column	1
advanced	1
into	1
action.	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
turned	1
round	1
without	1
answering	1
and	1
his	1
eye	1
happened	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
was	1
beside	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
him,	1
Kutuzov's	1
malevolent	1
and	1
caustic	1
expression	1
softened,	1
as	1
if	1
admitting	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
being	1
done	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
adjutant's	1
fault,	1
and	1
still	1
not	1
answering	1
the	1
Austrian	1
adjutant,	1
he	1
addressed	1
Bolkonski.	1
	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
third	1
division	1
has	1
passed	1
the	1
village.	1
Tell	1
it	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
await	1
my	1
orders."	1
	1
Hardly	1
had	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
started	1
than	1
he	1
stopped	1
him.	1
	1
"And	1
ask	1
whether	1
sharpshooters	1
have	1
been	1
posted,"	1
he	1
added.	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?	1
What	1
are	1
they	1
doing?"	1
he	1
murmured	1
to	1
himself,	1
still	1
not	1
replying	1
to	1
the	1
Austrian.	1
	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
galloped	1
off	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
order.	1
	1
Overtaking	1
the	1
battalions	1
that	1
continued	1
to	1
advance,	1
he	1
stopped	1
the	1
third	1
division	1
and	1
convinced	1
himself	1
that	1
there	1
really	1
were	1
no	1
sharpshooters	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
our	1
columns.	1
The	1
colonel	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
much	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
order	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
skirmishers.	1
He	1
had	1
felt	1
perfectly	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
troops	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
miles	1
away.	1
There	1
was	1
really	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
front	1
except	1
a	1
barren	1
descent	1
hidden	1
by	1
dense	1
mist.	1
Having	1
given	1
orders	1
in	1
the	1
commander-in-chief's	1
name	1
to	1
rectify	1
this	1
omission,	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
galloped	1
back.	1
Kutuzov	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place,	1
his	1
stout	1
body	1
resting	1
heavily	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
with	1
the	1
lassitude	1
of	1
age,	1
sat	1
yawning	1
wearily	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes.	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
moving,	1
but	1
stood	1
with	1
the	1
butts	1
of	1
their	1
muskets	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
"All	1
right,	1
all	1
right!"	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
who,	1
watch	1
in	1
hand,	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
they	1
started	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
left-flank	1
columns	1
had	1
already	1
descended.	1
	1
"Plenty	1
of	1
time,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
muttered	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
yawn.	1
"Plenty	1
of	1
time,"	1
he	1
repeated.	1
	1
Just	1
then	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
behind	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
regiments	1
saluting,	1
and	1
this	1
sound	1
rapidly	1
came	1
nearer	1
along	1
the	1
whole	1
extended	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
advancing	1
Russian	1
columns.	1
Evidently	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
were	1
greeting	1
was	1
riding	1
quickly.	1
When	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
regiment	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
which	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
standing	1
began	1
to	1
shout,	1
he	1
rode	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
a	1
frown.	1
Along	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
Pratzen	1
galloped	1
what	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
squadron	1
of	1
horsemen	1
in	1
various	1
uniforms.	1
Two	1
of	1
them	1
rode	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
in	1
front,	1
at	1
full	1
gallop.	1
One	1
in	1
a	1
black	1
uniform	1
with	1
white	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
hat	1
rode	1
a	1
bobtailed	1
chestnut	1
horse,	1
the	1
other	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
uniform	1
rode	1
a	1
black	1
one.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
Emperors	1
followed	1
by	1
their	1
suites.	1
Kutuzov,	1
affecting	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
soldier	1
at	1
the	1
front,	1
gave	1
the	1
command	1
"Attention!"	1
and	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Emperors	1
with	1
a	1
salute.	1
His	1
whole	1
appearance	1
and	1
manner	1
were	1
suddenly	1
transformed.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
a	1
subordinate	1
who	1
obeys	1
without	1
reasoning.	1
With	1
an	1
affectation	1
of	1
respect	1
which	1
evidently	1
struck	1
Alexander	1
unpleasantly,	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
and	1
saluted.	1
	1
This	1
unpleasant	1
impression	1
merely	1
flitted	1
over	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
happy	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
haze	1
across	1
a	1
clear	1
sky	1
and	1
vanished.	1
After	1
his	1
illness	1
he	1
looked	1
rather	1
thinner	1
that	1
day	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Olmutz	1
where	1
Bolkonski	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
abroad,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
same	1
bewitching	1
combination	1
of	1
majesty	1
and	1
mildness	1
in	1
his	1
fine	1
gray	1
eyes,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
delicate	1
lips	1
the	1
same	1
capacity	1
for	1
varying	1
expression	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
prevalent	1
appearance	1
of	1
goodhearted	1
innocent	1
youth.	1
	1
At	1
the	1
Olmutz	1
review	1
he	1
had	1
seemed	1
more	1
majestic;	1
here	1
he	1
seemed	1
brighter	1
and	1
more	1
energetic.	1
He	1
was	1
slightly	1
flushed	1
after	1
galloping	1
two	1
miles,	1
and	1
reining	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
sighed	1
restfully	1
and	1
looked	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
his	1
suite,	1
young	1
and	1
animated	1
as	1
his	1
own.	1
Czartoryski,	1
Novosiltsev,	1
Prince	1
Volkonsky,	1
Strogonov,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
all	1
richly	1
dressed	1
gay	1
young	1
men	1
on	1
splendid,	1
well-groomed,	1
fresh,	1
only	1
slightly	1
heated	1
horses,	1
exchanging	1
remarks	1
and	1
smiling,	1
had	1
stopped	1
behind	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
Emperor	1
Francis,	1
a	1
rosy,	1
long	1
faced	1
young	1
man,	1
sat	1
very	1
erect	1
on	1
his	1
handsome	1
black	1
horse,	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
leisurely	1
and	1
preoccupied	1
manner.	1
He	1
beckoned	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
adjutants	1
and	1
asked	1
some	1
question--"Most	1
likely	1
he	1
is	1
asking	1
at	1
what	1
o'clock	1
they	1
started,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
watching	1
his	1
old	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
as	1
he	1
recalled	1
his	1
reception	1
at	1
Brunn.	1
In	1
the	1
Emperors'	1
suite	1
were	1
the	1
picked	1
young	1
orderly	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Guard	1
and	1
line	1
regiments,	1
Russian	1
and	1
Austrian.	1
Among	1
them	1
were	1
grooms	1
leading	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
beautiful	1
relay	1
horses	1
covered	1
with	1
embroidered	1
cloths.	1
	1
As	1
when	1
a	1
window	1
is	1
opened	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
fresh	1
air	1
from	1
the	1
fields	1
enters	1
a	1
stuffy	1
room,	1
so	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
youthfulness,	1
energy,	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
success	1
reached	1
Kutuzov's	1
cheerless	1
staff	1
with	1
the	1
galloping	1
advent	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
brilliant	1
young	1
men.	1
	1
"Why	1
aren't	1
you	1
beginning,	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich?"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Alexander	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
Kutuzov,	1
glancing	1
courteously	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis.	1
	1
"I	1
am	1
waiting,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
answered	1
Kutuzov,	1
bending	1
forward	1
respectfully.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor,	1
frowning	1
slightly,	1
bent	1
his	1
ear	1
forward	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
quite	1
heard.	1
	1
"Waiting,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
repeated	1
Kutuzov.	1
(Prince	1
Andrew	1
noted	1
that	1
Kutuzov's	1
upper	1
lip	1
twitched	1
unnaturally	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
word	1
"waiting.")	1
"Not	1
all	1
the	1
columns	1
have	1
formed	1
up	1
yet,	1
Your	1
Majesty."	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
heard	1
but	1
obviously	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
reply;	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
rather	1
round	1
shoulders	1
and	1
glanced	1
at	1
Novosiltsev	1
who	1
was	1
near	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
complaining	1
of	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"You	1
know,	1
Michael	1
Ilarionovich,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field	1
where	1
a	1
parade	1
does	1
not	1
begin	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
troops	1
are	1
assembled,"	1
said	1
the	1
Tsar	1
with	1
another	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis,	1
as	1
if	1
inviting	1
him	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
But	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis	1
continued	1
to	1
look	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
listen.	1
	1
"That	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin,	1
sire,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov	1
in	1
a	1
resounding	1
voice,	1
apparently	1
to	1
preclude	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
heard,	1
and	1
again	1
something	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
twitched--"That	1
is	1
just	1
why	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin,	1
sire,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
parade	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field,"	1
said	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
Emperor's	1
suite	1
all	1
exchanged	1
rapid	1
looks	1
that	1
expressed	1
dissatisfaction	1
and	1
reproach.	1
"Old	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
be,	1
he	1
should	1
not,	1
he	1
certainly	1
should	1
not,	1
speak	1
like	1
that,"	1
their	1
glances	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
The	1
Tsar	1
looked	1
intently	1
and	1
observantly	1
into	1
Kutuzov's	1
eye	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
anything	1
more.	1
But	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
respectfully	1
bowed	1
head,	1
seemed	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
waiting.	1
The	1
silence	1
lasted	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
minute.	1
	1
"However,	1
if	1
you	1
command	1
it,	1
Your	1
Majesty,"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
lifting	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
again	1
assuming	1
his	1
former	1
tone	1
of	1
a	1
dull,	1
unreasoning,	1
but	1
submissive	1
general.	1
	1
He	1
touched	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
having	1
called	1
Miloradovich,	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
column,	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
order	1
to	1
advance.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
again	1
began	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
two	1
battalions	1
of	1
the	1
Novgorod	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Apsheron	1
regiment	1
went	1
forward	1
past	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
As	1
this	1
Apsheron	1
battalion	1
marched	1
by,	1
the	1
red-faced	1
Miloradovich,	1
without	1
his	1
greatcoat,	1
with	1
his	1
Orders	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
an	1
enormous	1
tuft	1
of	1
plumes	1
in	1
his	1
cocked	1
hat	1
worn	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
with	1
its	1
corners	1
front	1
and	1
back,	1
galloped	1
strenuously	1
forward,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
dashing	1
salute	1
reined	1
in	1
his	1
horse	1
before	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
general!"	1
said	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
	1
"Ma	1
foi,	1
sire,	1
nous	1
ferons	1
ce	1
qui	1
sera	1
dans	1
notre	1
possibilite,	1
sire,"	1
*	1
he	1
answered	1
gaily,	1
raising	1
nevertheless	1
ironic	1
smiles	1
among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
suite	1
by	1
his	1
poor	1
French.	1
	1
	1
*	1
"Indeed,	1
Sire,	1
we	1
shall	1
do	1
everything	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
do,	1
Sire."	1
	1
Miloradovich	1
wheeled	1
his	1
horse	1
sharply	1
and	1
stationed	1
himself	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
the	1
Emperor.	1
The	1
Apsheron	1
men,	1
excited	1
by	1
the	1
Tsar's	1
presence,	1
passed	1
in	1
step	1
before	1
the	1
Emperors	1
and	1
their	1
suites	1
at	1
a	1
bold,	1
brisk	1
pace.	1
	1
"Lads!"	1
shouted	1
Miloradovich	1
in	1
a	1
loud,	1
self-confident,	1
and	1
cheery	1
voice,	1
obviously	1
so	1
elated	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
firing,	1
by	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
battle,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
gallant	1
Apsherons,	1
his	1
comrades	1
in	1
Suvorov's	1
time,	1
now	1
passing	1
so	1
gallantly	1
before	1
the	1
Emperors,	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
the	1
sovereigns'	1
presence.	1
"Lads,	1
it's	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
you've	1
had	1
to	1
take,"	1
cried	1
he.	1
	1
"Glad	1
to	1
do	1
our	1
best!"	1
shouted	1
the	1
soldiers.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor's	1
horse	1
started	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
cry.	1
This	1
horse	1
that	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
sovereign	1
at	1
reviews	1
in	1
Russia	1
bore	1
him	1
also	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
Austerlitz,	1
enduring	1
the	1
heedless	1
blows	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
foot	1
and	1
pricking	1
its	1
ears	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
shots	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
done	1
on	1
the	1
Empress'	1
Field,	1
not	1
understanding	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
firing,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Francis'	1
black	1
cob,	1
nor	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
said,	1
thought,	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
day	1
by	1
its	1
rider.	1
	1
The	1
Emperor	1
turned	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
followers	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
remark	1
to	1
him,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
gallant	1
Apsherons.	1

CHAPTER	1
XVI	1
	1
Kutuzov	1
accompanied	1
by	1
his	1
adjutants	1
rode	1
at	1
a	1
walking	1
pace	1
behind	1
the	1
carabineers.	1
	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
column	1
he	1
stopped	1
at	1
a	1
solitary,	1
deserted	1
house	1
that	1
had	1
probably	1
once	1
been	1
an	1
inn,	1
where	1
two	1
roads	1
parted.	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
led	1
downhill	1
and	1
troops	1
were	1
marching	1
along	1
both.	1
	1
The	1
fog	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
clear	1
and	1
enemy	1
troops	1
were	1
already	1
dimly	1
visible	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
heights.	1
Down	1
below,	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
the	1
firing	1
became	1
more	1
distinct.	1
Kutuzov	1
had	1
stopped	1
and	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
an	1
Austrian	1
general.	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
behind	1
looking	1
at	1
them,	1
turned	1
to	1
an	1
adjutant	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
field	1
glass.	1
	1
"Look,	1
look!"	1
said	1
this	1
adjutant,	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
troops	1
in	1
the	1
distance,	1
but	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
before	1
him.	1
"It's	1
the	1
French!"	1
	1
The	1
two	1
generals	1
and	1
the	1
adjutant	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
glass,	1
trying	1
to	1
snatch	1
it	1
from	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
expression	1
on	1
all	1
their	1
faces	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
horror.	1
The	1
French	1
were	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
away,	1
but	1
had	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unexpectedly	1
appeared	1
just	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
us.	1
	1
"It's	1
the	1
enemy?...	1
No!...	1
Yes,	1
see	1
it	1
is!...	1
for	1
certain....	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
that?"	1
said	1
different	1
voices.	1
	1
With	1
the	1
naked	1
eye	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
saw	1
below	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
right,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
hundred	1
paces	1
from	1
where	1
Kutuzov	1
was	1
standing,	1
a	1
dense	1
French	1
column	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
Apsherons.	1
	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!	1
The	1
decisive	1
moment	1
has	1
arrived.	1
My	1
turn	1
has	1
come,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
striking	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
Kutuzov.	1
	1
"The	1
Apsherons	1
must	1
be	1
stopped,	1
your	1
excellency,"	1
cried	1
he.	1
But	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
instant	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
smoke	1
spread	1
all	1
round,	1
firing	1
was	1
heard	1
quite	1
close	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
naive	1
terror	1
barely	1
two	1
steps	1
from	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
shouted,	1
"Brothers!	1
All's	1
lost!"	1
And	1
at	1
this	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
command,	1
everyone	1
began	1
to	1
run.	1
	1
Confused	1
and	1
ever-increasing	1
crowds	1
were	1
running	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
troops	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
Emperors.	1
Not	1
only	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
stop	1
that	1
crowd,	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
back	1
with	1
it	1
oneself.	1
Bolkonski	1
only	1
tried	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
touch	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
bewildered	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
grasp	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
Nesvitski	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
face,	1
red	1
and	1
unlike	1
himself,	1
was	1
shouting	1
to	1
Kutuzov	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
ride	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
taken	1
prisoner.	1
Kutuzov	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
and	1
without	1
answering	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
handkerchief.	1
Blood	1
was	1
flowing	1
from	1
his	1
cheek.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
"You	1
are	1
wounded?"	1
he	1
asked,	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
trembling	1
of	1
his	1
lower	1
jaw.	1
	1
"The	1
wound	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
it	1
is	1
there!"	1
said	1
Kutuzov,	1
pressing	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
his	1
wounded	1
cheek	1
and	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
fleeing	1
soldiers.	1
"Stop	1
them!"	1
he	1
shouted,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
probably	1
realizing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
stop	1
them,	1
spurred	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
	1
A	1
fresh	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
mob	1
caught	1
him	1
and	1
bore	1
him	1
back	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
The	1
troops	1
were	1
running	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dense	1
mass	1
that	1
once	1
surrounded	1
by	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
again.	1
One	1
was	1
shouting,	1
"Get	1
on!	1
Why	1
are	1
you	1
hindering	1
us?"	1
Another	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
fired	1
in	1
the	1
air;	1
a	1
third	1
was	1
striking	1
the	1
horse	1
Kutuzov	1
himself	1
rode.	1
Having	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
got	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
left	1
from	1
that	1
flood	1
of	1
men,	1
Kutuzov,	1
with	1
his	1
suite	1
diminished	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
half,	1
rode	1
toward	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
artillery	1
fire	1
near	1
by.	1
Having	1
forced	1
his	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
fugitives,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
trying	1
to	1
keep	1
near	1
Kutuzov,	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
amid	1
the	1
smoke	1
a	1
Russian	1
battery	1
that	1
was	1
still	1
firing	1
and	1
Frenchmen	1
running	1
toward	1
it.	1
Higher	1
up	1
stood	1
some	1
Russian	1
infantry,	1
neither	1
moving	1
forward	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
battery	1
nor	1
backward	1
with	1
the	1
fleeing	1
crowd.	1
A	1
mounted	1
general	1
separated	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
infantry	1
and	1
approached	1
Kutuzov.	1
Of	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
only	1
four	1
remained.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
pale	1
and	1
exchanged	1
looks	1
in	1
silence.	1
	1
"Stop	1
those	1
wretches!"	1
gasped	1
Kutuzov	1
to	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
flying	1
soldiers;	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
instant,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
those	1
words,	1
bullets	1
flew	1
hissing	1
across	1
the	1
regiment	1
and	1
across	1
Kutuzov's	1
suite	1
like	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
little	1
birds.	1
	1
The	1
French	1
had	1
attacked	1
the	1
battery	1
and,	1
seeing	1
Kutuzov,	1
were	1
firing	1
at	1
him.	1
After	1
this	1
volley	1
the	1
regimental	1
commander	1
clutched	1
at	1
his	1
leg;	1
several	1
soldiers	1
fell,	1
and	1
a	1
second	1
lieutenant	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
flag	1
let	1
it	1
fall	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
It	1
swayed	1
and	1
fell,	1
but	1
caught	1
on	1
the	1
muskets	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
soldiers.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
started	1
firing	1
without	1
orders.	1
	1
"Oh!	1
Oh!	1
Oh!"	1
groaned	1
Kutuzov	1
despairingly	1
and	1
looked	1
around....	1
"Bolkonski!"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
his	1
voice	1
trembling	1
from	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
the	1
feebleness	1
of	1
age,	1
"Bolkonski!"	1
he	1
whispered,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
disordered	1
battalion	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
enemy,	1
"what's	1
that?"	1
	1
But	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
speaking,	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
feeling	1
tears	1
of	1
shame	1
and	1
anger	1
choking	1
him,	1
had	1
already	1
leapt	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
run	1
to	1
the	1
standard.	1
	1
"Forward,	1
lads!"	1
he	1
shouted	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
piercing	1
as	1
a	1
child's.	1
	1
"Here	1
it	1
is!"	1
thought	1
he,	1
seizing	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
the	1
standard	1
and	1
hearing	1
with	1
pleasure	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
bullets	1
evidently	1
aimed	1
at	1
him.	1
Several	1
soldiers	1
fell.	1
	1
"Hurrah!"	1
shouted	1
Prince	1
Andrew,	1
and,	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
the	1
heavy	1
standard,	1
he	1
ran	1
forward	1
with	1
full	1
confidence	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion	1
would	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
really	1
he	1
only	1
ran	1
a	1
few	1
steps	1
alone.	1
One	1
soldier	1
moved	1
and	1
then	1
another	1
and	1
soon	1
the	1
whole	1
battalion	1
ran	1
forward	1
shouting	1
"Hurrah!"	1
and	1
overtook	1
him.	1
A	1
sergeant	1
of	1
the	1
battalion	1
ran	1
up	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
flag	1
that	1
was	1
swaying	1
from	1
its	1
weight	1
in	1
Prince	1
Andrew's	1
hands,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
immediately	1
killed.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
again	1
seized	1
the	1
standard	1
and,	1
dragging	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
staff,	1
ran	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
battalion.	1
In	1
front	1
he	1
saw	1
our	1
artillerymen,	1
some	1
of	1
whom	1
were	1
fighting,	1
while	1
others,	1
having	1
abandoned	1
their	1
guns,	1
were	1
running	1
toward	1
him.	1
He	1
also	1
saw	1
French	1
infantry	1
soldiers	1
who	1
were	1
seizing	1
the	1
artillery	1
horses	1
and	1
turning	1
the	1
guns	1
round.	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
and	1
the	1
battalion	1
were	1
already	1
within	1
twenty	1
paces	1
of	1
the	1
cannon.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
whistle	1
of	1
bullets	1
above	1
him	1
unceasingly	1
and	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
of	1
him	1
soldiers	1
continually	1
groaned	1
and	1
dropped.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
them:	1
he	1
looked	1
only	1
at	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him--at	1
the	1
battery.	1
He	1
now	1
saw	1
clearly	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
with	1
his	1
shako	1
knocked	1
awry,	1
pulling	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
mop	1
while	1
a	1
French	1
soldier	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
He	1
could	1
distinctly	1
see	1
the	1
distraught	1
yet	1
angry	1
expression	1
on	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
men,	1
who	1
evidently	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing.	1
	1
"What	1
are	1
they	1
about?"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
as	1
he	1
gazed	1
at	1
them.	1
"Why	1
doesn't	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
run	1
away	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
unarmed?	1
Why	1
doesn't	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
stab	1
him?	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
get	1
away	1
before	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
remembers	1
his	1
bayonet	1
and	1
stabs	1
him...."	1
	1
And	1
really	1
another	1
French	1
soldier,	1
trailing	1
his	1
musket,	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
struggling	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner,	1
who	1
had	1
triumphantly	1
secured	1
the	1
mop	1
and	1
still	1
did	1
not	1
realize	1
what	1
awaited	1
him,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
decided.	1
But	1
Prince	1
Andrew	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
ended.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
near	1
him	1
hit	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
swing	1
of	1
a	1
bludgeon.	1
It	1
hurt	1
a	1
little,	1
but	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
distracted	1
him	1
and	1
prevented	1
his	1
seeing	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
at.	1
	1
"What's	1
this?	1
Am	1
I	1
falling?	1
My	1
legs	1
are	1
giving	1
way,"	1
thought	1
he,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
back.	1
He	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
struggle	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
with	1
the	1
gunners	1
ended,	1
whether	1
the	1
red-haired	1
gunner	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
or	1
not	1
and	1
whether	1
the	1
cannon	1
had	1
been	1
captured	1
or	1
saved.	1
But	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing.	1
Above	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
sky--the	1
lofty	1
sky,	1
not	1
clear	1
yet	1
still	1
immeasurably	1
lofty,	1
with	1
gray	1
clouds	1
gliding	1
slowly	1
across	1
it.	1
"How	1
quiet,	1
peaceful,	1
and	1
solemn;	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
I	1
ran,"	1
thought	1
Prince	1
Andrew--"not	1
as	1
we	1
ran,	1
shouting	1
and	1
fighting,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
as	1
the	1
gunner	1
and	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
with	1
frightened	1
and	1
angry	1
faces	1
struggled	1
for	1
the	1
mop:	1
how	1
differently	1
do	1
those	1
clouds	1
glide	1
across	1
that	1
lofty	1
infinite	1
sky!	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
lofty	1
sky	1
before?	1
And	1
how	1
happy	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
at	1
last!	1
Yes!	1
All	1
is	1
vanity,	1
all	1
falsehood,	1
except	1
that	1
infinite	1
sky.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing,	1
nothing,	1
but	1
that.	1
But	1
even	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
exist,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
quiet	1
and	1
peace.	1
Thank	1
God!..."	1
