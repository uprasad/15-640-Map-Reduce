gates;	1
and	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Dan.	1
	1
48:33	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
south	1
side	1
four	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred	1
measures:	1
and	1
three	1
gates;	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Simeon,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Issachar,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Zebulun.	1
	1
48:34	1
At	1
the	1
west	1
side	1
four	1
thousand	1
and	1
five	1
hundred,	1
with	1
their	1
three	1
gates;	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Gad,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Asher,	1
one	1
gate	1
of	1
Naphtali.	1
	1
48:35	1
It	1
was	1
round	1
about	1
eighteen	1
thousand	1
measures:	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
be,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
there.	1

	1
	1
The	1
Book	1
of	1
Daniel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
came	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
besieged	1
it.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
Jehoiakim	1
king	1
of	1
Judah	1
into	1
his	1
hand,	1
with	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God:	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god;	1
and	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
into	1
the	1
treasure	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
unto	1
Ashpenaz	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
eunuchs,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
seed,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
princes;	1
1:4	1
Children	1
in	1
whom	1
was	1
no	1
blemish,	1
but	1
well	1
favoured,	1
and	1
skilful	1
in	1
all	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
cunning	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding	1
science,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
ability	1
in	1
them	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
palace,	1
and	1
whom	1
they	1
might	1
teach	1
the	1
learning	1
and	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
appointed	1
them	1
a	1
daily	1
provision	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
so	1
nourishing	1
them	1
three	1
years,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
they	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:6	1
Now	1
among	1
these	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
1:7	1
Unto	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
gave	1
names:	1
for	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
of	1
Shadrach;	1
and	1
to	1
Mishael,	1
of	1
Meshach;	1
and	1
to	1
Azariah,	1
of	1
Abednego.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
Daniel	1
purposed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
defile	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat,	1
nor	1
with	1
the	1
wine	1
which	1
he	1
drank:	1
therefore	1
he	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
defile	1
himself.	1
	1
1:9	1
Now	1
God	1
had	1
brought	1
Daniel	1
into	1
favour	1
and	1
tender	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
fear	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
your	1
meat	1
and	1
your	1
drink:	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
see	1
your	1
faces	1
worse	1
liking	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
sort?	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
make	1
me	1
endanger	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
to	1
Melzar,	1
whom	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
had	1
set	1
over	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
1:12	1
Prove	1
thy	1
servants,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
ten	1
days;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
give	1
us	1
pulse	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
water	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
let	1
our	1
countenances	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat:	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
seest,	1
deal	1
with	1
thy	1
servants.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
he	1
consented	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
and	1
proved	1
them	1
ten	1
days.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
ten	1
days	1
their	1
countenances	1
appeared	1
fairer	1
and	1
fatter	1
in	1
flesh	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
which	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
meat.	1
	1
1:16	1
Thus	1
Melzar	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
their	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
drink;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
pulse.	1
	1
1:17	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
four	1
children,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
knowledge	1
and	1
skill	1
in	1
all	1
learning	1
and	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
Daniel	1
had	1
understanding	1
in	1
all	1
visions	1
and	1
dreams.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
in,	1
then	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
eunuchs	1
brought	1
them	1
in	1
before	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
communed	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
all	1
was	1
found	1
none	1
like	1
Daniel,	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah:	1
therefore	1
stood	1
they	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
understanding,	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
enquired	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
ten	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
and	1
astrologers	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
realm.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
Daniel	1
continued	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Cyrus.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
dreamed	1
dreams,	1
wherewith	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
brake	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
magicians,	1
and	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
and	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
his	1
dreams.	1
So	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
dreamed	1
a	1
dream,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit	1
was	1
troubled	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
Syriack,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
tell	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me:	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
with	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
your	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
shew	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
me	1
gifts	1
and	1
rewards	1
and	1
great	1
honour:	1
therefore	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
answered	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
the	1
king	1
tell	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
certainty	1
that	1
ye	1
would	1
gain	1
the	1
time,	1
because	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
gone	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
decree	1
for	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
prepared	1
lying	1
and	1
corrupt	1
words	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
me,	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
be	1
changed:	1
therefore	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
can	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
Chaldeans	1
answered	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
the	1
king's	1
matter:	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
king,	1
lord,	1
nor	1
ruler,	1
that	1
asked	1
such	1
things	1
at	1
any	1
magician,	1
or	1
astrologer,	1
or	1
Chaldean.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
rare	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
requireth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
that	1
can	1
shew	1
it	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
except	1
the	1
gods,	1
whose	1
dwelling	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
flesh.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
angry	1
and	1
very	1
furious,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
decree	1
went	1
forth	1
that	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
slain;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
to	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
with	1
counsel	1
and	1
wisdom	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
guard,	1
which	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
2:15	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Arioch	1
the	1
king's	1
captain,	1
Why	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
so	1
hasty	1
from	1
the	1
king?	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Daniel.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
desired	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
thing	1
known	1
to	1
Hananiah,	1
Mishael,	1
and	1
Azariah,	1
his	1
companions:	1
2:18	1
That	1
they	1
would	1
desire	1
mercies	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
concerning	1
this	1
secret;	1
that	1
Daniel	1
and	1
his	1
fellows	1
should	1
not	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:19	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
secret	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel	1
in	1
a	1
night	1
vision.	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
blessed	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:20	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever:	1
for	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might	1
are	1
his:	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
changeth	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons:	1
he	1
removeth	1
kings,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
kings:	1
he	1
giveth	1
wisdom	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
understanding:	1
2:22	1
He	1
revealeth	1
the	1
deep	1
and	1
secret	1
things:	1
he	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:23	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
and	1
praise	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
who	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
wisdom	1
and	1
might,	1
and	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
now	1
what	1
we	1
desired	1
of	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
now	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
king's	1
matter.	1
	1
2:24	1
Therefore	1
Daniel	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
Arioch,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
ordained	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him;	1
Destroy	1
not	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
bring	1
me	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:25	1
Then	1
Arioch	1
brought	1
in	1
Daniel	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
captives	1
of	1
Judah,	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
2:26	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
Art	1
thou	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
dream	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof?	1
	1
2:27	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
secret	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
demanded	1
cannot	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
soothsayers,	1
shew	1
unto	1
the	1
king;	1
2:28	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets,	1
and	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
Thy	1
dream,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
thy	1
head	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
are	1
these;	1
2:29	1
As	1
for	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
came	1
into	1
thy	1
mind	1
upon	1
thy	1
bed,	1
what	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
revealeth	1
secrets	1
maketh	1
known	1
to	1
thee	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
2:30	1
But	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
this	1
secret	1
is	1
not	1
revealed	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
any	1
wisdom	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
living,	1
but	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
that	1
shall	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
interpretation	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
thy	1
heart.	1
	1
2:31	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
sawest,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
great	1
image.	1
This	1
great	1
image,	1
whose	1
brightness	1
was	1
excellent,	1
stood	1
before	1
thee;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
thereof	1
was	1
terrible.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
image's	1
head	1
was	1
of	1
fine	1
gold,	1
his	1
breast	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
of	1
silver,	1
his	1
belly	1
and	1
his	1
thighs	1
of	1
brass,	1
2:33	1
His	1
legs	1
of	1
iron,	1
his	1
feet	1
part	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay.	1
	1
2:34	1
Thou	1
sawest	1
till	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
without	1
hands,	1
which	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
upon	1
his	1
feet	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
clay,	1
and	1
brake	1
them	1
to	1
pieces.	1
	1
2:35	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold,	1
broken	1
to	1
pieces	1
together,	1
and	1
became	1
like	1
the	1
chaff	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
threshingfloors;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
carried	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
no	1
place	1
was	1
found	1
for	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
smote	1
the	1
image	1
became	1
a	1
great	1
mountain,	1
and	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
2:36	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
dream;	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:37	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
art	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
kings:	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
power,	1
and	1
strength,	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
men	1
dwell,	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
into	1
thine	1
hand,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
them	1
all.	1
Thou	1
art	1
this	1
head	1
of	1
gold.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
after	1
thee	1
shall	1
arise	1
another	1
kingdom	1
inferior	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
another	1
third	1
kingdom	1
of	1
brass,	1
which	1
shall	1
bear	1
rule	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
as	1
iron:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
iron	1
breaketh	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
subdueth	1
all	1
things:	1
and	1
as	1
iron	1
that	1
breaketh	1
all	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
bruise.	1
	1
2:41	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
toes,	1
part	1
of	1
potters'	1
clay,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
divided;	1
but	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
iron,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
the	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
toes	1
of	1
the	1
feet	1
were	1
part	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
clay,	1
so	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
partly	1
strong,	1
and	1
partly	1
broken.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
whereas	1
thou	1
sawest	1
iron	1
mixed	1
with	1
miry	1
clay,	1
they	1
shall	1
mingle	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
cleave	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
as	1
iron	1
is	1
not	1
mixed	1
with	1
clay.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
these	1
kings	1
shall	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
which	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
other	1
people,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
and	1
consume	1
all	1
these	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
stand	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:45	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
without	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
iron,	1
the	1
brass,	1
the	1
clay,	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
gold;	1
the	1
great	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
what	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
hereafter:	1
and	1
the	1
dream	1
is	1
certain,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
sure.	1
	1
2:46	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
offer	1
an	1
oblation	1
and	1
sweet	1
odours	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
2:47	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
your	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
a	1
Lord	1
of	1
kings,	1
and	1
a	1
revealer	1
of	1
secrets,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
couldest	1
reveal	1
this	1
secret.	1
	1
2:48	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
Daniel	1
a	1
great	1
man,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
many	1
great	1
gifts,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
governors	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:49	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
requested	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon:	1
but	1
Daniel	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
an	1
image	1
of	1
gold,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
threescore	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
six	1
cubits:	1
he	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Dura,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
3:2	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
to	1
gather	1
together	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:3	1
Then	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
the	1
judges,	1
the	1
treasurers,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
the	1
sheriffs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
provinces,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
the	1
dedication	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
an	1
herald	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
To	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
commanded,	1
O	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
3:5	1
That	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
hath	1
set	1
up:	1
3:6	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth	1
shall	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:7	1
Therefore	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
heard	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
languages,	1
fell	1
down	1
and	1
worshipped	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
that	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:8	1
Wherefore	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
certain	1
Chaldeans	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
accused	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
3:9	1
They	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
3:10	1
Thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
hast	1
made	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image:	1
3:11	1
And	1
whoso	1
falleth	1
not	1
down	1
and	1
worshippeth,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:12	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
Jews	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego;	1
these	1
men,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
not	1
regarded	1
thee:	1
they	1
serve	1
not	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
in	1
his	1
rage	1
and	1
fury	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
these	1
men	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
3:14	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
true,	1
O	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
serve	1
my	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
up?	1
	1
3:15	1
Now	1
if	1
ye	1
be	1
ready	1
that	1
at	1
what	1
time	1
ye	1
hear	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
cornet,	1
flute,	1
harp,	1
sackbut,	1
psaltery,	1
and	1
dulcimer,	1
and	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
musick,	1
ye	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
made;	1
well:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
worship	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace;	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
that	1
God	1
that	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hands?	1
	1
3:16	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
careful	1
to	1
answer	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
our	1
God	1
whom	1
we	1
serve	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
if	1
not,	1
be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
thy	1
gods,	1
nor	1
worship	1
the	1
golden	1
image	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
up.	1
	1
3:19	1
Then	1
was	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
full	1
of	1
fury,	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
his	1
visage	1
was	1
changed	1
against	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego:	1
therefore	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
heat	1
the	1
furnace	1
one	1
seven	1
times	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
heated.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
most	1
mighty	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
army	1
to	1
bind	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:21	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
their	1
coats,	1
their	1
hosen,	1
and	1
their	1
hats,	1
and	1
their	1
other	1
garments,	1
and	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:22	1
Therefore	1
because	1
the	1
king's	1
commandment	1
was	1
urgent,	1
and	1
the	1
furnace	1
exceeding	1
hot,	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
slew	1
those	1
men	1
that	1
took	1
up	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
these	1
three	1
men,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
fell	1
down	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace.	1
	1
3:24	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
astonied,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
in	1
haste,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
counsellors,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
three	1
men	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
True,	1
O	1
king.	1
	1
3:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
I	1
see	1
four	1
men	1
loose,	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
hurt;	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:26	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
came	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
fiery	1
furnace,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
ye	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
Then	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
came	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:27	1
And	1
the	1
princes,	1
governors,	1
and	1
captains,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
counsellors,	1
being	1
gathered	1
together,	1
saw	1
these	1
men,	1
upon	1
whose	1
bodies	1
the	1
fire	1
had	1
no	1
power,	1
nor	1
was	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
their	1
head	1
singed,	1
neither	1
were	1
their	1
coats	1
changed,	1
nor	1
the	1
smell	1
of	1
fire	1
had	1
passed	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
3:28	1
Then	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
who	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
delivered	1
his	1
servants	1
that	1
trusted	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
changed	1
the	1
king's	1
word,	1
and	1
yielded	1
their	1
bodies,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
serve	1
nor	1
worship	1
any	1
god,	1
except	1
their	1
own	1
God.	1
	1
3:29	1
Therefore	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
every	1
people,	1
nation,	1
and	1
language,	1
which	1
speak	1
any	1
thing	1
amiss	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
dunghill:	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
God	1
that	1
can	1
deliver	1
after	1
this	1
sort.	1
	1
3:30	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
promoted	1
Shadrach,	1
Meshach,	1
and	1
Abednego,	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:1	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
the	1
king,	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:2	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
good	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
that	1
the	1
high	1
God	1
hath	1
wrought	1
toward	1
me.	1
	1
4:3	1
How	1
great	1
are	1
his	1
signs!	1
and	1
how	1
mighty	1
are	1
his	1
wonders!	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
4:4	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
was	1
at	1
rest	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
in	1
my	1
palace:	1
4:5	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
dream	1
which	1
made	1
me	1
afraid,	1
and	1
the	1
thoughts	1
upon	1
my	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
4:6	1
Therefore	1
made	1
I	1
a	1
decree	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
dream.	1
	1
4:7	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
magicians,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers:	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream	1
before	1
them;	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:8	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
Daniel	1
came	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods:	1
and	1
before	1
him	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
secret	1
troubleth	1
thee,	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
dream	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:10	1
Thus	1
were	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
mine	1
head	1
in	1
my	1
bed;	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
tree	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
thereof	1
reached	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:12	1
The	1
leaves	1
thereof	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all:	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
had	1
shadow	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
dwelt	1
in	1
the	1
boughs	1
thereof,	1
and	1
all	1
flesh	1
was	1
fed	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
upon	1
my	1
bed,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven;	1
4:14	1
He	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
and	1
said	1
thus,	1
Hew	1
down	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
branches,	1
shake	1
off	1
his	1
leaves,	1
and	1
scatter	1
his	1
fruit:	1
let	1
the	1
beasts	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
under	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
from	1
his	1
branches:	1
4:15	1
Nevertheless	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
his	1
roots	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
in	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:16	1
Let	1
his	1
heart	1
be	1
changed	1
from	1
man's,	1
and	1
let	1
a	1
beast's	1
heart	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
let	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
4:17	1
This	1
matter	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
watchers,	1
and	1
the	1
demand	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
ones:	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will,	1
and	1
setteth	1
up	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
basest	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:18	1
This	1
dream	1
I	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
have	1
seen.	1
Now	1
thou,	1
O	1
Belteshazzar,	1
declare	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation:	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
able;	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
4:19	1
Then	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Belteshazzar,	1
was	1
astonied	1
for	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him.	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Belteshazzar,	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
dream,	1
or	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
trouble	1
thee.	1
Belteshazzar	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
lord,	1
the	1
dream	1
be	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof	1
to	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:20	1
The	1
tree	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest,	1
which	1
grew,	1
and	1
was	1
strong,	1
whose	1
height	1
reached	1
unto	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
thereof	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
4:21	1
Whose	1
leaves	1
were	1
fair,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof	1
much,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
was	1
meat	1
for	1
all;	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
upon	1
whose	1
branches	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
had	1
their	1
habitation:	1
4:22	1
It	1
is	1
thou,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
art	1
grown	1
and	1
become	1
strong:	1
for	1
thy	1
greatness	1
is	1
grown,	1
and	1
reacheth	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
thy	1
dominion	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
whereas	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
a	1
watcher	1
and	1
an	1
holy	1
one	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hew	1
the	1
tree	1
down,	1
and	1
destroy	1
it;	1
yet	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
roots	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
brass,	1
in	1
the	1
tender	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
let	1
his	1
portion	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
till	1
seven	1
times	1
pass	1
over	1
him;	1
4:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation,	1
O	1
king,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king:	1
4:25	1
That	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
wet	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
till	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
whereas	1
they	1
commanded	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
stump	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
roots;	1
thy	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
sure	1
unto	1
thee,	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
heavens	1
do	1
rule.	1
	1
4:27	1
Wherefore,	1
O	1
king,	1
let	1
my	1
counsel	1
be	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
break	1
off	1
thy	1
sins	1
by	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
thine	1
iniquities	1
by	1
shewing	1
mercy	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
if	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
lengthening	1
of	1
thy	1
tranquillity.	1
	1
4:28	1
All	1
this	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar.	1
	1
4:29	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
twelve	1
months	1
he	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
4:30	1
The	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
great	1
Babylon,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
built	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
power,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
majesty?	1
	1
4:31	1
While	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
king's	1
mouth,	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
O	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar,	1
to	1
thee	1
it	1
is	1
spoken;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
thee	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
thy	1
dwelling	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
thee,	1
until	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
ruleth	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
giveth	1
it	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
4:33	1
The	1
same	1
hour	1
was	1
the	1
thing	1
fulfilled	1
upon	1
Nebuchadnezzar:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
men,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
grass	1
as	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven,	1
till	1
his	1
hairs	1
were	1
grown	1
like	1
eagles'	1
feathers,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
like	1
birds'	1
claws.	1
	1
4:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
mine	1
understanding	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
blessed	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
I	1
praised	1
and	1
honoured	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever,	1
whose	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
is	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation:	1
4:35	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
reputed	1
as	1
nothing:	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
stay	1
his	1
hand,	1
or	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
doest	1
thou?	1
	1
4:36	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
my	1
reason	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
mine	1
honour	1
and	1
brightness	1
returned	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
my	1
counsellors	1
and	1
my	1
lords	1
sought	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
excellent	1
majesty	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
4:37	1
Now	1
I	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
praise	1
and	1
extol	1
and	1
honour	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
heaven,	1
all	1
whose	1
works	1
are	1
truth,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
judgment:	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
walk	1
in	1
pride	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
abase.	1
	1
5:1	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
of	1
his	1
lords,	1
and	1
drank	1
wine	1
before	1
the	1
thousand.	1
	1
5:2	1
Belshazzar,	1
whiles	1
he	1
tasted	1
the	1
wine,	1
commanded	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
golden	1
and	1
silver	1
vessels	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
that	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
might	1
drink	1
therein.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
golden	1
vessels	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
his	1
princes,	1
his	1
wives,	1
and	1
his	1
concubines,	1
drank	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
drank	1
wine,	1
and	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
of	1
brass,	1
of	1
iron,	1
of	1
wood,	1
and	1
of	1
stone.	1
	1
5:5	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
came	1
forth	1
fingers	1
of	1
a	1
man's	1
hand,	1
and	1
wrote	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
candlestick	1
upon	1
the	1
plaister	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
palace:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
saw	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
that	1
wrote.	1
	1
5:6	1
Then	1
the	1
king's	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed,	1
and	1
his	1
thoughts	1
troubled	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
joints	1
of	1
his	1
loins	1
were	1
loosed,	1
and	1
his	1
knees	1
smote	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
king	1
cried	1
aloud	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
the	1
soothsayers.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
Babylon,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
shew	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
shall	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:8	1
Then	1
came	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
king's	1
wise	1
men:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
nor	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
was	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
greatly	1
troubled,	1
and	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
changed	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
were	1
astonied.	1
	1
5:10	1
Now	1
the	1
queen	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
lords	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
banquet	1
house:	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
trouble	1
thee,	1
nor	1
let	1
thy	1
countenance	1
be	1
changed:	1
5:11	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
gods;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
father	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
like	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
gods,	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
him;	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father,	1
the	1
king,	1
I	1
say,	1
thy	1
father,	1
made	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
magicians,	1
astrologers,	1
Chaldeans,	1
and	1
soothsayers;	1
5:12	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit,	1
and	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
understanding,	1
interpreting	1
of	1
dreams,	1
and	1
shewing	1
of	1
hard	1
sentences,	1
and	1
dissolving	1
of	1
doubts,	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
Daniel,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
named	1
Belteshazzar:	1
now	1
let	1
Daniel	1
be	1
called,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:13	1
Then	1
was	1
Daniel	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
king.	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
art	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
whom	1
the	1
king	1
my	1
father	1
brought	1
out	1
of	1
Jewry?	1
	1
5:14	1
I	1
have	1
even	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
gods	1
is	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
light	1
and	1
understanding	1
and	1
excellent	1
wisdom	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
the	1
astrologers,	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
before	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
read	1
this	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
unto	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
shew	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
5:16	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
interpretations,	1
and	1
dissolve	1
doubts:	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
read	1
the	1
writing,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
interpretation	1
thereof,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
thy	1
neck,	1
and	1
shalt	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
Daniel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
Let	1
thy	1
gifts	1
be	1
to	1
thyself,	1
and	1
give	1
thy	1
rewards	1
to	1
another;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
the	1
writing	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
interpretation.	1
	1
5:18	1
O	1
thou	1
king,	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
gave	1
Nebuchadnezzar	1
thy	1
father	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
majesty,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
honour:	1
5:19	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
majesty	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him,	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
trembled	1
and	1
feared	1
before	1
him:	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
slew;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
kept	1
alive;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
set	1
up;	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
he	1
put	1
down.	1
	1
5:20	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
mind	1
hardened	1
in	1
pride,	1
he	1
was	1
deposed	1
from	1
his	1
kingly	1
throne,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
glory	1
from	1
him:	1
5:21	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
made	1
like	1
the	1
beasts,	1
and	1
his	1
dwelling	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
asses:	1
they	1
fed	1
him	1
with	1
grass	1
like	1
oxen,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
wet	1
with	1
the	1
dew	1
of	1
heaven;	1
till	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God	1
ruled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
appointeth	1
over	1
it	1
whomsoever	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
And	1
thou	1
his	1
son,	1
O	1
Belshazzar,	1
hast	1
not	1
humbled	1
thine	1
heart,	1
though	1
thou	1
knewest	1
all	1
this;	1
5:23	1
But	1
hast	1
lifted	1
up	1
thyself	1
against	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
lords,	1
thy	1
wives,	1
and	1
thy	1
concubines,	1
have	1
drunk	1
wine	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
praised	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
gold,	1
of	1
brass,	1
iron,	1
wood,	1
and	1
stone,	1
which	1
see	1
not,	1
nor	1
hear,	1
nor	1
know:	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
in	1
whose	1
hand	1
thy	1
breath	1
is,	1
and	1
whose	1
are	1
all	1
thy	1
ways,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
glorified:	1
5:24	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
sent	1
from	1
him;	1
and	1
this	1
writing	1
was	1
written.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
writing	1
that	1
was	1
written,	1
MENE,	1
MENE,	1
TEKEL,	1
UPHARSIN.	1
	1
5:26	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
thing:	1
MENE;	1
God	1
hath	1
numbered	1
thy	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
finished	1
it.	1
	1
5:27	1
TEKEL;	1
Thou	1
art	1
weighed	1
in	1
the	1
balances,	1
and	1
art	1
found	1
wanting.	1
	1
5:28	1
PERES;	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
is	1
divided,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
commanded	1
Belshazzar,	1
and	1
they	1
clothed	1
Daniel	1
with	1
scarlet,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
proclamation	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
ruler	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
5:30	1
In	1
that	1
night	1
was	1
Belshazzar	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans	1
slain.	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Darius	1
the	1
Median	1
took	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
being	1
about	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
years	1
old.	1
	1
6:1	1
It	1
pleased	1
Darius	1
to	1
set	1
over	1
the	1
kingdom	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
princes,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom;	1
6:2	1
And	1
over	1
these	1
three	1
presidents;	1
of	1
whom	1
Daniel	1
was	1
first:	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
might	1
give	1
accounts	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
damage.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
this	1
Daniel	1
was	1
preferred	1
above	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes,	1
because	1
an	1
excellent	1
spirit	1
was	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
thought	1
to	1
set	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
realm.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
the	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
sought	1
to	1
find	1
occasion	1
against	1
Daniel	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
none	1
occasion	1
nor	1
fault;	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
faithful,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
error	1
or	1
fault	1
found	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:5	1
Then	1
said	1
these	1
men,	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
any	1
occasion	1
against	1
this	1
Daniel,	1
except	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
against	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:6	1
Then	1
these	1
presidents	1
and	1
princes	1
assembled	1
together	1
to	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
him,	1
King	1
Darius,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:7	1
All	1
the	1
presidents	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
the	1
governors,	1
and	1
the	1
princes,	1
the	1
counsellors,	1
and	1
the	1
captains,	1
have	1
consulted	1
together	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
royal	1
statute,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
decree,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
for	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now,	1
O	1
king,	1
establish	1
the	1
decree,	1
and	1
sign	1
the	1
writing,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
changed,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:9	1
Wherefore	1
king	1
Darius	1
signed	1
the	1
writing	1
and	1
the	1
decree.	1
	1
6:10	1
Now	1
when	1
Daniel	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
signed,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
his	1
windows	1
being	1
open	1
in	1
his	1
chamber	1
toward	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
before	1
his	1
God,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
aforetime.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled,	1
and	1
found	1
Daniel	1
praying	1
and	1
making	1
supplication	1
before	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
Then	1
they	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
spake	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
concerning	1
the	1
king's	1
decree;	1
Hast	1
thou	1
not	1
signed	1
a	1
decree,	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
shall	1
ask	1
a	1
petition	1
of	1
any	1
God	1
or	1
man	1
within	1
thirty	1
days,	1
save	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions?	1
The	1
king	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
thing	1
is	1
true,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians,	1
which	1
altereth	1
not.	1
	1
6:13	1
Then	1
answered	1
they	1
and	1
said	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
That	1
Daniel,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah,	1
regardeth	1
not	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
nor	1
the	1
decree	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
signed,	1
but	1
maketh	1
his	1
petition	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
day.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
the	1
king,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
was	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
set	1
his	1
heart	1
on	1
Daniel	1
to	1
deliver	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
laboured	1
till	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
deliver	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Then	1
these	1
men	1
assembled	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
Know,	1
O	1
king,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Medes	1
and	1
Persians	1
is,	1
That	1
no	1
decree	1
nor	1
statute	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
establisheth	1
may	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
6:16	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
Now	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
Thy	1
God	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
he	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
brought,	1
and	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
den;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
sealed	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
signet,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
signet	1
of	1
his	1
lords;	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
concerning	1
Daniel.	1
	1
6:18	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
to	1
his	1
palace,	1
and	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
fasting:	1
neither	1
were	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick	1
brought	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
his	1
sleep	1
went	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
6:19	1
Then	1
the	1
king	1
arose	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
den,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
lamentable	1
voice	1
unto	1
Daniel:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
spake	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Daniel,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
is	1
thy	1
God,	1
whom	1
thou	1
servest	1
continually,	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
lions?	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Daniel	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
O	1
king,	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:22	1
My	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
the	1
lions'	1
mouths,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
hurt	1
me:	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
before	1
him	1
innocency	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
me;	1
and	1
also	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king,	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
hurt.	1
	1
6:23	1
Then	1
was	1
the	1
king	1
exceedingly	1
glad	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
Daniel	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
So	1
Daniel	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
den,	1
and	1
no	1
manner	1
of	1
hurt	1
was	1
found	1
upon	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
commanded,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
had	1
accused	1
Daniel,	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
den	1
of	1
lions,	1
them,	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
wives;	1
and	1
the	1
lions	1
had	1
the	1
mastery	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
brake	1
all	1
their	1
bones	1
in	1
pieces	1
or	1
ever	1
they	1
came	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
den.	1
	1
6:25	1
Then	1
king	1
Darius	1
wrote	1
unto	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
earth;	1
Peace	1
be	1
multiplied	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:26	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
decree,	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
dominion	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
men	1
tremble	1
and	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
and	1
stedfast	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
6:27	1
He	1
delivereth	1
and	1
rescueth,	1
and	1
he	1
worketh	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth,	1
who	1
hath	1
delivered	1
Daniel	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
lions.	1
	1
6:28	1
So	1
this	1
Daniel	1
prospered	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Darius,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
the	1
Persian.	1
	1
7:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Belshazzar	1
king	1
of	1
Babylon	1
Daniel	1
had	1
a	1
dream	1
and	1
visions	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
upon	1
his	1
bed:	1
then	1
he	1
wrote	1
the	1
dream,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
matters.	1
	1
7:2	1
Daniel	1
spake	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
my	1
vision	1
by	1
night,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven	1
strove	1
upon	1
the	1
great	1
sea.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
four	1
great	1
beasts	1
came	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
diverse	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
first	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
had	1
eagle's	1
wings:	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
wings	1
thereof	1
were	1
plucked,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
made	1
stand	1
upon	1
the	1
feet	1
as	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man's	1
heart	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
behold	1
another	1
beast,	1
a	1
second,	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
bear,	1
and	1
it	1
raised	1
up	1
itself	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
three	1
ribs	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
it	1
between	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
thus	1
unto	1
it,	1
Arise,	1
devour	1
much	1
flesh.	1
	1
7:6	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
lo	1
another,	1
like	1
a	1
leopard,	1
which	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
four	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
fowl;	1
the	1
beast	1
had	1
also	1
four	1
heads;	1
and	1
dominion	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
7:7	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
dreadful	1
and	1
terrible,	1
and	1
strong	1
exceedingly;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
great	1
iron	1
teeth:	1
it	1
devoured	1
and	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
it:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
ten	1
horns.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
considered	1
the	1
horns,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
among	1
them	1
another	1
little	1
horn,	1
before	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
horns	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
in	1
this	1
horn	1
were	1
eyes	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
speaking	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
beheld	1
till	1
the	1
thrones	1
were	1
cast	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
did	1
sit,	1
whose	1
garment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
snow,	1
and	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
pure	1
wool:	1
his	1
throne	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
fiery	1
flame,	1
and	1
his	1
wheels	1
as	1
burning	1
fire.	1
	1
7:10	1
A	1
fiery	1
stream	1
issued	1
and	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
before	1
him:	1
thousand	1
thousands	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
times	1
ten	1
thousand	1
stood	1
before	1
him:	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
set,	1
and	1
the	1
books	1
were	1
opened.	1
	1
7:11	1
I	1
beheld	1
then	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
horn	1
spake:	1
I	1
beheld	1
even	1
till	1
the	1
beast	1
was	1
slain,	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
burning	1
flame.	1
	1
7:12	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
beasts,	1
they	1
had	1
their	1
dominion	1
taken	1
away:	1
yet	1
their	1
lives	1
were	1
prolonged	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
and	1
time.	1
	1
7:13	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
visions,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days,	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
near	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
dominion,	1
and	1
glory,	1
and	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
all	1
people,	1
nations,	1
and	1
languages,	1
should	1
serve	1
him:	1
his	1
dominion	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
dominion,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
	1
7:15	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
grieved	1
in	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
visions	1
of	1
my	1
head	1
troubled	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
I	1
came	1
near	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
So	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
made	1
me	1
know	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
things.	1
	1
7:17	1
These	1
great	1
beasts,	1
which	1
are	1
four,	1
are	1
four	1
kings,	1
which	1
shall	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
7:18	1
But	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
possess	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
7:19	1
Then	1
I	1
would	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
beast,	1
which	1
was	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
others,	1
exceeding	1
dreadful,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
were	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
his	1
nails	1
of	1
brass;	1
which	1
devoured,	1
brake	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
stamped	1
the	1
residue	1
with	1
his	1
feet;	1
7:20	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
before	1
whom	1
three	1
fell;	1
even	1
of	1
that	1
horn	1
that	1
had	1
eyes,	1
and	1
a	1
mouth	1
that	1
spake	1
very	1
great	1
things,	1
whose	1
look	1
was	1
more	1
stout	1
than	1
his	1
fellows.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
beheld,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
horn	1
made	1
war	1
with	1
the	1
saints,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them;	1
7:22	1
Until	1
the	1
Ancient	1
of	1
days	1
came,	1
and	1
judgment	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
possessed	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
7:23	1
Thus	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
fourth	1
beast	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
fourth	1
kingdom	1
upon	1
earth,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
all	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
shall	1
tread	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
break	1
it	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
the	1
ten	1
horns	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
kingdom	1
are	1
ten	1
kings	1
that	1
shall	1
arise:	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
rise	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
diverse	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
subdue	1
three	1
kings.	1
	1
7:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
great	1
words	1
against	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
shall	1
wear	1
out	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
and	1
think	1
to	1
change	1
times	1
and	1
laws:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
until	1
a	1
time	1
and	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
dividing	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
the	1
judgment	1
shall	1
sit,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
dominion,	1
to	1
consume	1
and	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
kingdom	1
and	1
dominion,	1
and	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
whose	1
kingdom	1
is	1
an	1
everlasting	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
all	1
dominions	1
shall	1
serve	1
and	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
7:28	1
Hitherto	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
As	1
for	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
my	1
cogitations	1
much	1
troubled	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
countenance	1
changed	1
in	1
me:	1
but	1
I	1
kept	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
king	1
Belshazzar	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
unto	1
me	1
Daniel,	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
appeared	1
unto	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I	1
saw,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Shushan	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Elam;	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Ulai.	1
	1
8:3	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
river	1
a	1
ram	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
horns	1
were	1
high;	1
but	1
one	1
was	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
higher	1
came	1
up	1
last.	1
	1
8:4	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
ram	1
pushing	1
westward,	1
and	1
northward,	1
and	1
southward;	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
beasts	1
might	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
became	1
great.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
considering,	1
behold,	1
an	1
he	1
goat	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
and	1
touched	1
not	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
the	1
goat	1
had	1
a	1
notable	1
horn	1
between	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ram	1
that	1
had	1
two	1
horns,	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
come	1
close	1
unto	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
choler	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
ram,	1
and	1
brake	1
his	1
two	1
horns:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
ram	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
him:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
that	1
could	1
deliver	1
the	1
ram	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
8:8	1
Therefore	1
the	1
he	1
goat	1
waxed	1
very	1
great:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
strong,	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
was	1
broken;	1
and	1
for	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
four	1
notable	1
ones	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
out	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
horn,	1
which	1
waxed	1
exceeding	1
great,	1
toward	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
it	1
waxed	1
great,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
host	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
stamped	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
8:11	1
Yea,	1
he	1
magnified	1
himself	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
was	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
was	1
cast	1
down.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
an	1
host	1
was	1
given	1
him	1
against	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
transgression,	1
and	1
it	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
it	1
practised,	1
and	1
prospered.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
I	1
heard	1
one	1
saint	1
speaking,	1
and	1
another	1
saint	1
said	1
unto	1
that	1
certain	1
saint	1
which	1
spake,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision	1
concerning	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
desolation,	1
to	1
give	1
both	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot?	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Unto	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
days;	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
be	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
I,	1
even	1
I	1
Daniel,	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
sought	1
for	1
the	1
meaning,	1
then,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
man's	1
voice	1
between	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
Ulai,	1
which	1
called,	1
and	1
said,	1
Gabriel,	1
make	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:17	1
So	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
where	1
I	1
stood:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
my	1
face:	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Understand,	1
O	1
son	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground:	1
but	1
he	1
touched	1
me,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upright.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
know	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
indignation:	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
8:20	1
The	1
ram	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
having	1
two	1
horns	1
are	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Media	1
and	1
Persia.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
rough	1
goat	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Grecia:	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
horn	1
that	1
is	1
between	1
his	1
eyes	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
king.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
that	1
being	1
broken,	1
whereas	1
four	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
it,	1
four	1
kingdoms	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
time	1
of	1
their	1
kingdom,	1
when	1
the	1
transgressors	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
fierce	1
countenance,	1
and	1
understanding	1
dark	1
sentences,	1
shall	1
stand	1
up.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
his	1
power	1
shall	1
be	1
mighty,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
destroy	1
wonderfully,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper,	1
and	1
practise,	1
and	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
mighty	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
people.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
through	1
his	1
policy	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
craft	1
to	1
prosper	1
in	1
his	1
hand;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
by	1
peace	1
shall	1
destroy	1
many:	1
he	1
shall	1
also	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
princes;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
without	1
hand.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
is	1
true:	1
wherefore	1
shut	1
thou	1
up	1
the	1
vision;	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
fainted,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
certain	1
days;	1
afterward	1
I	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
did	1
the	1
king's	1
business;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
vision,	1
but	1
none	1
understood	1
it.	1
	1
9:1	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Ahasuerus,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
the	1
Medes,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
king	1
over	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans;	1
9:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
his	1
reign	1
I	1
Daniel	1
understood	1
by	1
books	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
whereof	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
to	1
Jeremiah	1
the	1
prophet,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
accomplish	1
seventy	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
desolations	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
God,	1
to	1
seek	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplications,	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
ashes:	1
9:4	1
And	1
I	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
confession,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
God,	1
keeping	1
the	1
covenant	1
and	1
mercy	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
keep	1
his	1
commandments;	1
9:5	1
We	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
have	1
committed	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly,	1
and	1
have	1
rebelled,	1
even	1
by	1
departing	1
from	1
thy	1
precepts	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
judgments:	1
9:6	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
spake	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
9:7	1
O	1
LORD,	1
righteousness	1
belongeth	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
confusion	1
of	1
faces,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
unto	1
all	1
Israel,	1
that	1
are	1
near,	1
and	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
countries	1
whither	1
thou	1
hast	1
driven	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
trespass	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
trespassed	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:8	1
O	1
Lord,	1
to	1
us	1
belongeth	1
confusion	1
of	1
face,	1
to	1
our	1
kings,	1
to	1
our	1
princes,	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
9:9	1
To	1
the	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
belong	1
mercies	1
and	1
forgivenesses,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
rebelled	1
against	1
him;	1
9:10	1
Neither	1
have	1
we	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
laws,	1
which	1
he	1
set	1
before	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
9:11	1
Yea,	1
all	1
Israel	1
have	1
transgressed	1
thy	1
law,	1
even	1
by	1
departing,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
obey	1
thy	1
voice;	1
therefore	1
the	1
curse	1
is	1
poured	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
oath	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
hath	1
confirmed	1
his	1
words,	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
against	1
us,	1
and	1
against	1
our	1
judges	1
that	1
judged	1
us,	1
by	1
bringing	1
upon	1
us	1
a	1
great	1
evil:	1
for	1
under	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
done	1
as	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
all	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
us:	1
yet	1
made	1
we	1
not	1
our	1
prayer	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
turn	1
from	1
our	1
iniquities,	1
and	1
understand	1
thy	1
truth.	1
	1
9:14	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
the	1
LORD	1
watched	1
upon	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
upon	1
us:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
righteous	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
which	1
he	1
doeth:	1
for	1
we	1
obeyed	1
not	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Lord	1
our	1
God,	1
that	1
hast	1
brought	1
thy	1
people	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
hand,	1
and	1
hast	1
gotten	1
thee	1
renown,	1
as	1
at	1
this	1
day;	1
we	1
have	1
sinned,	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
wickedly.	1
	1
9:16	1
O	1
LORD,	1
according	1
to	1
all	1
thy	1
righteousness,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
thine	1
anger	1
and	1
thy	1
fury	1
be	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
thy	1
city	1
Jerusalem,	1
thy	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
because	1
for	1
our	1
sins,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
iniquities	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
become	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
us.	1
	1
9:17	1
Now	1
therefore,	1
O	1
our	1
God,	1
hear	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
thy	1
servant,	1
and	1
his	1
supplications,	1
and	1
cause	1
thy	1
face	1
to	1
shine	1
upon	1
thy	1
sanctuary	1
that	1
is	1
desolate,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:18	1
O	1
my	1
God,	1
incline	1
thine	1
ear,	1
and	1
hear;	1
open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
behold	1
our	1
desolations,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name:	1
for	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
our	1
supplications	1
before	1
thee	1
for	1
our	1
righteousnesses,	1
but	1
for	1
thy	1
great	1
mercies.	1
	1
9:19	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hear;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
forgive;	1
O	1
Lord,	1
hearken	1
and	1
do;	1
defer	1
not,	1
for	1
thine	1
own	1
sake,	1
O	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
thy	1
city	1
and	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking,	1
and	1
praying,	1
and	1
confessing	1
my	1
sin	1
and	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel,	1
and	1
presenting	1
my	1
supplication	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain	1
of	1
my	1
God;	1
9:21	1
Yea,	1
whiles	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
prayer,	1
even	1
the	1
man	1
Gabriel,	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
vision	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
being	1
caused	1
to	1
fly	1
swiftly,	1
touched	1
me	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
oblation.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
he	1
informed	1
me,	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
skill	1
and	1
understanding.	1
	1
9:23	1
At	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
thy	1
supplications	1
the	1
commandment	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
shew	1
thee;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
beloved:	1
therefore	1
understand	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
9:24	1
Seventy	1
weeks	1
are	1
determined	1
upon	1
thy	1
people	1
and	1
upon	1
thy	1
holy	1
city,	1
to	1
finish	1
the	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
reconciliation	1
for	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
in	1
everlasting	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
to	1
seal	1
up	1
the	1
vision	1
and	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
to	1
anoint	1
the	1
most	1
Holy.	1
	1
9:25	1
Know	1
therefore	1
and	1
understand,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
going	1
forth	1
of	1
the	1
commandment	1
to	1
restore	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
Messiah	1
the	1
Prince	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
weeks,	1
and	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks:	1
the	1
street	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
wall,	1
even	1
in	1
troublous	1
times.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
after	1
threescore	1
and	1
two	1
weeks	1
shall	1
Messiah	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
himself:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
prince	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
shall	1
destroy	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuary;	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
a	1
flood,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
desolations	1
are	1
determined.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
confirm	1
the	1
covenant	1
with	1
many	1
for	1
one	1
week:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
and	1
the	1
oblation	1
to	1
cease,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
overspreading	1
of	1
abominations	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
it	1
desolate,	1
even	1
until	1
the	1
consummation,	1
and	1
that	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
upon	1
the	1
desolate.	1
	1
10:1	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
year	1
of	1
Cyrus	1
king	1
of	1
Persia	1
a	1
thing	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
Daniel,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
Belteshazzar;	1
and	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
true,	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
was	1
long:	1
and	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
thing,	1
and	1
had	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
vision.	1
	1
10:2	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
I	1
Daniel	1
was	1
mourning	1
three	1
full	1
weeks.	1
	1
10:3	1
I	1
ate	1
no	1
pleasant	1
bread,	1
neither	1
came	1
flesh	1
nor	1
wine	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
neither	1
did	1
I	1
anoint	1
myself	1
at	1
all,	1
till	1
three	1
whole	1
weeks	1
were	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
month,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
river,	1
which	1
is	1
Hiddekel;	1
10:5	1
Then	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
whose	1
loins	1
were	1
girded	1
with	1
fine	1
gold	1
of	1
Uphaz:	1
10:6	1
His	1
body	1
also	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
beryl,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
lamps	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
in	1
colour	1
to	1
polished	1
brass,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
like	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
multitude.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
I	1
Daniel	1
alone	1
saw	1
the	1
vision:	1
for	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
not	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
quaking	1
fell	1
upon	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
to	1
hide	1
themselves.	1
	1
10:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
saw	1
this	1
great	1
vision,	1
and	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me:	1
for	1
my	1
comeliness	1
was	1
turned	1
in	1
me	1
into	1
corruption,	1
and	1
I	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:9	1
Yet	1
heard	1
I	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
then	1
was	1
I	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
10:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
an	1
hand	1
touched	1
me,	1
which	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
my	1
knees	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
my	1
hands.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
a	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
understand	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
stand	1
upright:	1
for	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
I	1
now	1
sent.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
word	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
stood	1
trembling.	1
	1
10:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
set	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
understand,	1
and	1
to	1
chasten	1
thyself	1
before	1
thy	1
God,	1
thy	1
words	1
were	1
heard,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
for	1
thy	1
words.	1
	1
10:13	1
But	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Persia	1
withstood	1
me	1
one	1
and	1
twenty	1
days:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
Michael,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
princes,	1
came	1
to	1
help	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Persia.	1
	1
10:14	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
understand	1
what	1
shall	1
befall	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
such	1
words	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
became	1
dumb.	1
	1
10:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men	1
touched	1
my	1
lips:	1
then	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
spake,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
me,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
by	1
the	1
vision	1
my	1
sorrows	1
are	1
turned	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
retained	1
no	1
strength.	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
this	1
my	1
lord	1
talk	1
with	1
this	1
my	1
lord?	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
straightway	1
there	1
remained	1
no	1
strength	1
in	1
me,	1
neither	1
is	1
there	1
breath	1
left	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
10:18	1
Then	1
there	1
came	1
again	1
and	1
touched	1
me	1
one	1
like	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
strengthened	1
me,	1
10:19	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
man	1
greatly	1
beloved,	1
fear	1
not:	1
peace	1
be	1
unto	1
thee,	1
be	1
strong,	1
yea,	1
be	1
strong.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
strengthened,	1
and	1
said,	1
Let	1
my	1
lord	1
speak;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
strengthened	1
me.	1
	1
10:20	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
wherefore	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Persia:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
forth,	1
lo,	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
Grecia	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
noted	1
in	1
the	1
scripture	1
of	1
truth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
holdeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
but	1
Michael	1
your	1
prince.	1
	1
11:1	1
Also	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
Mede,	1
even	1
I,	1
stood	1
to	1
confirm	1
and	1
to	1
strengthen	1
him.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
thee	1
the	1
truth.	1
Behold,	1
there	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
yet	1
three	1
kings	1
in	1
Persia;	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
shall	1
be	1
far	1
richer	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
through	1
his	1
riches	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
all	1
against	1
the	1
realm	1
of	1
Grecia.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
a	1
mighty	1
king	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
with	1
great	1
dominion,	1
and	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
up,	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
toward	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
posterity,	1
nor	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
dominion	1
which	1
he	1
ruled:	1
for	1
his	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
plucked	1
up,	1
even	1
for	1
others	1
beside	1
those.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
princes;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
strong	1
above	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
dominion;	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
dominion.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
years	1
they	1
shall	1
join	1
themselves	1
together;	1
for	1
the	1
king's	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
agreement:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
retain	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
arm;	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand,	1
nor	1
his	1
arm:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
up,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
brought	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
begat	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
strengthened	1
her	1
in	1
these	1
times.	1
	1
11:7	1
But	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
her	1
roots	1
shall	1
one	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate,	1
which	1
shall	1
come	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
shall	1
deal	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
shall	1
prevail:	1
11:8	1
And	1
shall	1
also	1
carry	1
captives	1
into	1
Egypt	1
their	1
gods,	1
with	1
their	1
princes,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
precious	1
vessels	1
of	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
gold;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
continue	1
more	1
years	1
than	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north.	1
	1
11:9	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
shall	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
his	1
sons	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
assemble	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
great	1
forces:	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come,	1
and	1
overflow,	1
and	1
pass	1
through:	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
return,	1
and	1
be	1
stirred	1
up,	1
even	1
to	1
his	1
fortress.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
moved	1
with	1
choler,	1
and	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
him,	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
great	1
multitude;	1
but	1
the	1
multitude	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cast	1
down	1
many	1
ten	1
thousands:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
it.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
shall	1
set	1
forth	1
a	1
multitude	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
shall	1
certainly	1
come	1
after	1
certain	1
years	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
riches.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
times	1
there	1
shall	1
many	1
stand	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south:	1
also	1
the	1
robbers	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
exalt	1
themselves	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
vision;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
11:15	1
So	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
cast	1
up	1
a	1
mount,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
most	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
not	1
withstand,	1
neither	1
his	1
chosen	1
people,	1
neither	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
strength	1
to	1
withstand.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
stand	1
before	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
which	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
consumed.	1
	1
11:17	1
He	1
shall	1
also	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
enter	1
with	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
whole	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
upright	1
ones	1
with	1
him;	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
women,	1
corrupting	1
her:	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
neither	1
be	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
11:18	1
After	1
this	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
unto	1
the	1
isles,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
many:	1
but	1
a	1
prince	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
behalf	1
shall	1
cause	1
the	1
reproach	1
offered	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
cease;	1
without	1
his	1
own	1
reproach	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
it	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:19	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
turn	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
fort	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
land:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
stumble	1
and	1
fall,	1
and	1
not	1
be	1
found.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
a	1
raiser	1
of	1
taxes	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
within	1
few	1
days	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
neither	1
in	1
anger,	1
nor	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
stand	1
up	1
a	1
vile	1
person,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
peaceably,	1
and	1
obtain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
by	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
a	1
flood	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
overflown	1
from	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
yea,	1
also	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
league	1
made	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
shall	1
work	1
deceitfully:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
shall	1
become	1
strong	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
people.	1
	1
11:24	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
peaceably	1
even	1
upon	1
the	1
fattest	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
province;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
fathers	1
have	1
not	1
done,	1
nor	1
his	1
fathers'	1
fathers;	1
he	1
shall	1
scatter	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
prey,	1
and	1
spoil,	1
and	1
riches:	1
yea,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
forecast	1
his	1
devices	1
against	1
the	1
strong	1
holds,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stir	1
up	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
his	1
courage	1
against	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
army;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
be	1
stirred	1
up	1
to	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
and	1
mighty	1
army;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
forecast	1
devices	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
11:26	1
Yea,	1
they	1
that	1
feed	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
meat	1
shall	1
destroy	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
army	1
shall	1
overflow:	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
fall	1
down	1
slain.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
kings'	1
hearts	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
do	1
mischief,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
lies	1
at	1
one	1
table;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
prosper:	1
for	1
yet	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:28	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
return	1
into	1
his	1
land	1
with	1
great	1
riches;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
shall	1
be	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
exploits,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
11:29	1
At	1
the	1
time	1
appointed	1
he	1
shall	1
return,	1
and	1
come	1
toward	1
the	1
south;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
former,	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
latter.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
Chittim	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
grieved,	1
and	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant:	1
so	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
return,	1
and	1
have	1
intelligence	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
forsake	1
the	1
holy	1
covenant.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
arms	1
shall	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
pollute	1
the	1
sanctuary	1
of	1
strength,	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
place	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate.	1
	1
11:32	1
And	1
such	1
as	1
do	1
wickedly	1
against	1
the	1
covenant	1
shall	1
he	1
corrupt	1
by	1
flatteries:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
do	1
know	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
strong,	1
and	1
do	1
exploits.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
understand	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
instruct	1
many:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
by	1
flame,	1
by	1
captivity,	1
and	1
by	1
spoil,	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
11:34	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
holpen	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
help:	1
but	1
many	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
flatteries.	1
	1
11:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
understanding	1
shall	1
fall,	1
to	1
try	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
purge,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
white,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
appointed.	1
	1
11:36	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
do	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself,	1
and	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
every	1
god,	1
and	1
shall	1
speak	1
marvellous	1
things	1
against	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
gods,	1
and	1
shall	1
prosper	1
till	1
the	1
indignation	1
be	1
accomplished:	1
for	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
determined	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
11:37	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
regard	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
fathers,	1
nor	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
women,	1
nor	1
regard	1
any	1
god:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
magnify	1
himself	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
11:38	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
estate	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
forces:	1
and	1
a	1
god	1
whom	1
his	1
fathers	1
knew	1
not	1
shall	1
he	1
honour	1
with	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
with	1
precious	1
stones,	1
and	1
pleasant	1
things.	1
	1
11:39	1
Thus	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
strong	1
holds	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
god,	1
whom	1
he	1
shall	1
acknowledge	1
and	1
increase	1
with	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
many,	1
and	1
shall	1
divide	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
gain.	1
	1
11:40	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
push	1
at	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
whirlwind,	1
with	1
chariots,	1
and	1
with	1
horsemen,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
ships;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
countries,	1
and	1
shall	1
overflow	1
and	1
pass	1
over.	1
	1
11:41	1
He	1
shall	1
enter	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
land,	1
and	1
many	1
countries	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown:	1
but	1
these	1
shall	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
even	1
Edom,	1
and	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon.	1
	1
11:42	1
He	1
shall	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
countries:	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
not	1
escape.	1
	1
11:43	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
precious	1
things	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
and	1
the	1
Libyans	1
and	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
steps.	1
	1
11:44	1
But	1
tidings	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
shall	1
trouble	1
him:	1
therefore	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
great	1
fury	1
to	1
destroy,	1
and	1
utterly	1
to	1
make	1
away	1
many.	1
	1
11:45	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
plant	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
his	1
palace	1
between	1
the	1
seas	1
in	1
the	1
glorious	1
holy	1
mountain;	1
yet	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
end,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
help	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
shall	1
Michael	1
stand	1
up,	1
the	1
great	1
prince	1
which	1
standeth	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
thy	1
people:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
trouble,	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
was	1
since	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nation	1
even	1
to	1
that	1
same	1
time:	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
thy	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered,	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
awake,	1
some	1
to	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
some	1
to	1
shame	1
and	1
everlasting	1
contempt.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
be	1
wise	1
shall	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
firmament;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
turn	1
many	1
to	1
righteousness	1
as	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
12:4	1
But	1
thou,	1
O	1
Daniel,	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
words,	1
and	1
seal	1
the	1
book,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end:	1
many	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
be	1
increased.	1
	1
12:5	1
Then	1
I	1
Daniel	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
stood	1
other	1
two,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
one	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
How	1
long	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
wonders?	1
12:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
linen,	1
which	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
when	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sware	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
liveth	1
for	1
ever	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
times,	1
and	1
an	1
half;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
accomplished	1
to	1
scatter	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
people,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
finished.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
I	1
heard,	1
but	1
I	1
understood	1
not:	1
then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
Lord,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way,	1
Daniel:	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
closed	1
up	1
and	1
sealed	1
till	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
12:10	1
Many	1
shall	1
be	1
purified,	1
and	1
made	1
white,	1
and	1
tried;	1
but	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
do	1
wickedly:	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
understand;	1
but	1
the	1
wise	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
daily	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
abomination	1
that	1
maketh	1
desolate	1
set	1
up,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
ninety	1
days.	1
	1
12:12	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
waiteth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
five	1
and	1
thirty	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
But	1
go	1
thou	1
thy	1
way	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
be:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
rest,	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
thy	1
lot	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Hosea	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
unto	1
Hosea,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beeri,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah,	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash,	1
king	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Hosea.	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
Hosea,	1
Go,	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
a	1
wife	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
and	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms:	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
hath	1
committed	1
great	1
whoredom,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
took	1
Gomer	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Diblaim;	1
which	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
him	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Jezreel;	1
for	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Jezreel	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jehu,	1
and	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
cease	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Israel,	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
she	1
conceived	1
again,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
daughter.	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Call	1
her	1
name	1
Loruhamah:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
take	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
save	1
them	1
by	1
bow,	1
nor	1
by	1
sword,	1
nor	1
by	1
battle,	1
by	1
horses,	1
nor	1
by	1
horsemen.	1
	1
1:8	1
Now	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
weaned	1
Loruhamah,	1
she	1
conceived,	1
and	1
bare	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
God,	1
Call	1
his	1
name	1
Loammi:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:10	1
Yet	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
measured	1
nor	1
numbered;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
appoint	1
themselves	1
one	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land:	1
for	1
great	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:1	1
Say	1
ye	1
unto	1
your	1
brethren,	1
Ammi;	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
sisters,	1
Ruhamah.	1
	1
2:2	1
Plead	1
with	1
your	1
mother,	1
plead:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
wife,	1
neither	1
am	1
I	1
her	1
husband:	1
let	1
her	1
therefore	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
whoredoms	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
sight,	1
and	1
her	1
adulteries	1
from	1
between	1
her	1
breasts;	1
2:3	1
Lest	1
I	1
strip	1
her	1
naked,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
make	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
slay	1
her	1
with	1
thirst.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
children;	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
whoredoms.	1
	1
2:5	1
For	1
their	1
mother	1
hath	1
played	1
the	1
harlot:	1
she	1
that	1
conceived	1
them	1
hath	1
done	1
shamefully:	1
for	1
she	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
after	1
my	1
lovers,	1
that	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
bread	1
and	1
my	1
water,	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax,	1
mine	1
oil	1
and	1
my	1
drink.	1
	1
2:6	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
hedge	1
up	1
thy	1
way	1
with	1
thorns,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
wall,	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
paths.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
follow	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
but	1
she	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
seek	1
them,	1
but	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
them:	1
then	1
shall	1
she	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
first	1
husband;	1
for	1
then	1
was	1
it	1
better	1
with	1
me	1
than	1
now.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
her	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
multiplied	1
her	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
which	1
they	1
prepared	1
for	1
Baal.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
return,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
thereof,	1
and	1
my	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
season	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
recover	1
my	1
wool	1
and	1
my	1
flax	1
given	1
to	1
cover	1
her	1
nakedness.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
discover	1
her	1
lewdness	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
deliver	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
hand.	1
	1
2:11	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
cause	1
all	1
her	1
mirth	1
to	1
cease,	1
her	1
feast	1
days,	1
her	1
new	1
moons,	1
and	1
her	1
sabbaths,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
solemn	1
feasts.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
her	1
vines	1
and	1
her	1
fig	1
trees,	1
whereof	1
she	1
hath	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
my	1
rewards	1
that	1
my	1
lovers	1
have	1
given	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
a	1
forest,	1
and	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
shall	1
eat	1
them.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
upon	1
her	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Baalim,	1
wherein	1
she	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
she	1
decked	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
earrings	1
and	1
her	1
jewels,	1
and	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
her	1
lovers,	1
and	1
forgat	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
allure	1
her,	1
and	1
bring	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
speak	1
comfortably	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
her	1
vineyards	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Achor	1
for	1
a	1
door	1
of	1
hope:	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
sing	1
there,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
youth,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
Ishi;	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
me	1
no	1
more	1
Baali.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Baalim	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered	1
by	1
their	1
name.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
creeping	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
the	1
bow	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
safely.	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
for	1
ever;	1
yea,	1
I	1
will	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
in	1
judgment,	1
and	1
in	1
lovingkindness,	1
and	1
in	1
mercies.	1
	1
2:20	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
betroth	1
thee	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
faithfulness:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
I	1
will	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
oil;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
Jezreel.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
her	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
mercy;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
yet,	1
love	1
a	1
woman	1
beloved	1
of	1
her	1
friend,	1
yet	1
an	1
adulteress,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
toward	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
who	1
look	1
to	1
other	1
gods,	1
and	1
love	1
flagons	1
of	1
wine.	1
	1
3:2	1
So	1
I	1
bought	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
fifteen	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
for	1
an	1
homer	1
of	1
barley,	1
and	1
an	1
half	1
homer	1
of	1
barley:	1
3:3	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
abide	1
for	1
me	1
many	1
days;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
another	1
man:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
be	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
abide	1
many	1
days	1
without	1
a	1
king,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
prince,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
image,	1
and	1
without	1
an	1
ephod,	1
and	1
without	1
teraphim:	1
3:5	1
Afterward	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
return,	1
and	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
David	1
their	1
king;	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD	1
and	1
his	1
goodness	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
days.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth,	1
nor	1
mercy,	1
nor	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
By	1
swearing,	1
and	1
lying,	1
and	1
killing,	1
and	1
stealing,	1
and	1
committing	1
adultery,	1
they	1
break	1
out,	1
and	1
blood	1
toucheth	1
blood.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
land	1
mourn,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein	1
shall	1
languish,	1
with	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
heaven;	1
yea,	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
4:4	1
Yet	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
strive,	1
nor	1
reprove	1
another:	1
for	1
thy	1
people	1
are	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
strive	1
with	1
the	1
priest.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
fall	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
prophet	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
4:6	1
My	1
people	1
are	1
destroyed	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
knowledge,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
reject	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
no	1
priest	1
to	1
me:	1
seeing	1
thou	1
hast	1
forgotten	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
thy	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
forget	1
thy	1
children.	1
	1
4:7	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
increased,	1
so	1
they	1
sinned	1
against	1
me:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
change	1
their	1
glory	1
into	1
shame.	1
	1
4:8	1
They	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
their	1
heart	1
on	1
their	1
iniquity.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be,	1
like	1
people,	1
like	1
priest:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
ways,	1
and	1
reward	1
them	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
they	1
shall	1
eat,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
enough:	1
they	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
increase:	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
to	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
Whoredom	1
and	1
wine	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
heart.	1
	1
4:12	1
My	1
people	1
ask	1
counsel	1
at	1
their	1
stocks,	1
and	1
their	1
staff	1
declareth	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
hath	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
under	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
upon	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
upon	1
the	1
hills,	1
under	1
oaks	1
and	1
poplars	1
and	1
elms,	1
because	1
the	1
shadow	1
thereof	1
is	1
good:	1
therefore	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
your	1
spouses	1
shall	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
punish	1
your	1
daughters	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
whoredom,	1
nor	1
your	1
spouses	1
when	1
they	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
for	1
themselves	1
are	1
separated	1
with	1
whores,	1
and	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
harlots:	1
therefore	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
doth	1
not	1
understand	1
shall	1
fall.	1
	1
4:15	1
Though	1
thou,	1
Israel,	1
play	1
the	1
harlot,	1
yet	1
let	1
not	1
Judah	1
offend;	1
and	1
come	1
not	1
ye	1
unto	1
Gilgal,	1
neither	1
go	1
ye	1
up	1
to	1
Bethaven,	1
nor	1
swear,	1
The	1
LORD	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:16	1
For	1
Israel	1
slideth	1
back	1
as	1
a	1
backsliding	1
heifer:	1
now	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
feed	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lamb	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
place.	1
	1
4:17	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
idols:	1
let	1
him	1
alone.	1
	1
4:18	1
Their	1
drink	1
is	1
sour:	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
whoredom	1
continually:	1
her	1
rulers	1
with	1
shame	1
do	1
love,	1
Give	1
ye.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
wind	1
hath	1
bound	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this,	1
O	1
priests;	1
and	1
hearken,	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
and	1
give	1
ye	1
ear,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
king;	1
for	1
judgment	1
is	1
toward	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
snare	1
on	1
Mizpah,	1
and	1
a	1
net	1
spread	1
upon	1
Tabor.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
the	1
revolters	1
are	1
profound	1
to	1
make	1
slaughter,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
rebuker	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
5:3	1
I	1
know	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
not	1
hid	1
from	1
me:	1
for	1
now,	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
thou	1
committest	1
whoredom,	1
and	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
5:4	1
They	1
will	1
not	1
frame	1
their	1
doings	1
to	1
turn	1
unto	1
their	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
whoredoms	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
doth	1
testify	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
Israel	1
and	1
Ephraim	1
fall	1
in	1
their	1
iniquity:	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fall	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:6	1
They	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
their	1
flocks	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
herds	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD;	1
but	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him;	1
he	1
hath	1
withdrawn	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
5:7	1
They	1
have	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
begotten	1
strange	1
children:	1
now	1
shall	1
a	1
month	1
devour	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
portions.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
cornet	1
in	1
Gibeah,	1
and	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Ramah:	1
cry	1
aloud	1
at	1
Bethaven,	1
after	1
thee,	1
O	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
5:9	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
rebuke:	1
among	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
known	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
surely	1
be.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
princes	1
of	1
Judah	1
were	1
like	1
them	1
that	1
remove	1
the	1
bound:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
wrath	1
upon	1
them	1
like	1
water.	1
	1
5:11	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
oppressed	1
and	1
broken	1
in	1
judgment,	1
because	1
he	1
willingly	1
walked	1
after	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
5:12	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
moth,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
as	1
rottenness.	1
	1
5:13	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
saw	1
his	1
sickness,	1
and	1
Judah	1
saw	1
his	1
wound,	1
then	1
went	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
yet	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
heal	1
you,	1
nor	1
cure	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
wound.	1
	1
5:14	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
Ephraim	1
as	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
I,	1
even	1
I,	1
will	1
tear	1
and	1
go	1
away;	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
rescue	1
him.	1
	1
5:15	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
place,	1
till	1
they	1
acknowledge	1
their	1
offence,	1
and	1
seek	1
my	1
face:	1
in	1
their	1
affliction	1
they	1
will	1
seek	1
me	1
early.	1
	1
6:1	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
torn,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
heal	1
us;	1
he	1
hath	1
smitten,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
bind	1
us	1
up.	1
	1
6:2	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
will	1
he	1
revive	1
us:	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
will	1
raise	1
us	1
up,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
live	1
in	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
6:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
we	1
know,	1
if	1
we	1
follow	1
on	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
LORD:	1
his	1
going	1
forth	1
is	1
prepared	1
as	1
the	1
morning;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
us	1
as	1
the	1
rain,	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
former	1
rain	1
unto	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:4	1
O	1
Ephraim,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
O	1
Judah,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
for	1
your	1
goodness	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
morning	1
cloud,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
it	1
goeth	1
away.	1
	1
6:5	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
hewed	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
prophets;	1
I	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
mouth:	1
and	1
thy	1
judgments	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
6:6	1
For	1
I	1
desired	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice;	1
and	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
than	1
burnt	1
offerings.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
they	1
like	1
men	1
have	1
transgressed	1
the	1
covenant:	1
there	1
have	1
they	1
dealt	1
treacherously	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:8	1
Gilead	1
is	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
is	1
polluted	1
with	1
blood.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
as	1
troops	1
of	1
robbers	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
man,	1
so	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
priests	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
by	1
consent:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
lewdness.	1
	1
6:10	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
an	1
horrible	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
whoredom	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
Israel	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
6:11	1
Also,	1
O	1
Judah,	1
he	1
hath	1
set	1
an	1
harvest	1
for	1
thee,	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
When	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
healed	1
Israel,	1
then	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
for	1
they	1
commit	1
falsehood;	1
and	1
the	1
thief	1
cometh	1
in,	1
and	1
the	1
troop	1
of	1
robbers	1
spoileth	1
without.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
they	1
consider	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
that	1
I	1
remember	1
all	1
their	1
wickedness:	1
now	1
their	1
own	1
doings	1
have	1
beset	1
them	1
about;	1
they	1
are	1
before	1
my	1
face.	1
	1
7:3	1
They	1
make	1
the	1
king	1
glad	1
with	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
with	1
their	1
lies.	1
	1
7:4	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
adulterers,	1
as	1
an	1
oven	1
heated	1
by	1
the	1
baker,	1
who	1
ceaseth	1
from	1
raising	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
kneaded	1
the	1
dough,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
leavened.	1
	1
7:5	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
king	1
the	1
princes	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
sick	1
with	1
bottles	1
of	1
wine;	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
scorners.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
ready	1
their	1
heart	1
like	1
an	1
oven,	1
whiles	1
they	1
lie	1
in	1
wait:	1
their	1
baker	1
sleepeth	1
all	1
the	1
night;	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
burneth	1
as	1
a	1
flaming	1
fire.	1
	1
7:7	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
hot	1
as	1
an	1
oven,	1
and	1
have	1
devoured	1
their	1
judges;	1
all	1
their	1
kings	1
are	1
fallen:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
calleth	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Ephraim,	1
he	1
hath	1
mixed	1
himself	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
a	1
cake	1
not	1
turned.	1
	1
7:9	1
Strangers	1
have	1
devoured	1
his	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
it	1
not:	1
yea,	1
gray	1
hairs	1
are	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
upon	1
him,	1
yet	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Israel	1
testifieth	1
to	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
nor	1
seek	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
this.	1
	1
7:11	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
silly	1
dove	1
without	1
heart:	1
they	1
call	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
Assyria.	1
	1
7:12	1
When	1
they	1
shall	1
go,	1
I	1
will	1
spread	1
my	1
net	1
upon	1
them;	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven;	1
I	1
will	1
chastise	1
them,	1
as	1
their	1
congregation	1
hath	1
heard.	1
	1
7:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
them!	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
fled	1
from	1
me:	1
destruction	1
unto	1
them!	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
cried	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
when	1
they	1
howled	1
upon	1
their	1
beds:	1
they	1
assemble	1
themselves	1
for	1
corn	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
they	1
rebel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:15	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
bound	1
and	1
strengthened	1
their	1
arms,	1
yet	1
do	1
they	1
imagine	1
mischief	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
7:16	1
They	1
return,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High:	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
a	1
deceitful	1
bow:	1
their	1
princes	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
for	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
their	1
tongue:	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
derision	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:1	1
Set	1
the	1
trumpet	1
to	1
thy	1
mouth.	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
as	1
an	1
eagle	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
transgressed	1
my	1
covenant,	1
and	1
trespassed	1
against	1
my	1
law.	1
	1
8:2	1
Israel	1
shall	1
cry	1
unto	1
me,	1
My	1
God,	1
we	1
know	1
thee.	1
	1
8:3	1
Israel	1
hath	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
good:	1
the	1
enemy	1
shall	1
pursue	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
They	1
have	1
set	1
up	1
kings,	1
but	1
not	1
by	1
me:	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
princes,	1
and	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
not:	1
of	1
their	1
silver	1
and	1
their	1
gold	1
have	1
they	1
made	1
them	1
idols,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
8:5	1
Thy	1
calf,	1
O	1
Samaria,	1
hath	1
cast	1
thee	1
off;	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
kindled	1
against	1
them:	1
how	1
long	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
ere	1
they	1
attain	1
to	1
innocency?	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
from	1
Israel	1
was	1
it	1
also:	1
the	1
workman	1
made	1
it;	1
therefore	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
calf	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
they	1
have	1
sown	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
reap	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
it	1
hath	1
no	1
stalk;	1
the	1
bud	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meal:	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
yield,	1
the	1
strangers	1
shall	1
swallow	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
8:8	1
Israel	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up:	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
as	1
a	1
vessel	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
up	1
to	1
Assyria,	1
a	1
wild	1
ass	1
alone	1
by	1
himself:	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
hired	1
lovers.	1
	1
8:10	1
Yea,	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
hired	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sorrow	1
a	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
princes.	1
	1
8:11	1
Because	1
Ephraim	1
hath	1
made	1
many	1
altars	1
to	1
sin,	1
altars	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
sin.	1
	1
8:12	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
great	1
things	1
of	1
my	1
law,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
as	1
a	1
strange	1
thing.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
sacrifice	1
flesh	1
for	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
of	1
mine	1
offerings,	1
and	1
eat	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
accepteth	1
them	1
not;	1
now	1
will	1
he	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
visit	1
their	1
sins:	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
Israel	1
hath	1
forgotten	1
his	1
Maker,	1
and	1
buildeth	1
temples;	1
and	1
Judah	1
hath	1
multiplied	1
fenced	1
cities:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
9:1	1
Rejoice	1
not,	1
O	1
Israel,	1
for	1
joy,	1
as	1
other	1
people:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
gone	1
a	1
whoring	1
from	1
thy	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
a	1
reward	1
upon	1
every	1
cornfloor.	1
	1
9:2	1
The	1
floor	1
and	1
the	1
winepress	1
shall	1
not	1
feed	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
shall	1
fail	1
in	1
her.	1
	1
9:3	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
land;	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
eat	1
unclean	1
things	1
in	1
Assyria.	1
	1
9:4	1
They	1
shall	1
not	1
offer	1
wine	1
offerings	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
pleasing	1
unto	1
him:	1
their	1
sacrifices	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
mourners;	1
all	1
that	1
eat	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
polluted:	1
for	1
their	1
bread	1
for	1
their	1
soul	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:5	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
day,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
LORD?	1
	1
9:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
because	1
of	1
destruction:	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
up,	1
Memphis	1
shall	1
bury	1
them:	1
the	1
pleasant	1
places	1
for	1
their	1
silver,	1
nettles	1
shall	1
possess	1
them:	1
thorns	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
9:7	1
The	1
days	1
of	1
visitation	1
are	1
come,	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
recompence	1
are	1
come;	1
Israel	1
shall	1
know	1
it:	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
fool,	1
the	1
spiritual	1
man	1
is	1
mad,	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thine	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
hatred.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
watchman	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
was	1
with	1
my	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
prophet	1
is	1
a	1
snare	1
of	1
a	1
fowler	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
hatred	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
God.	1
	1
9:9	1
They	1
have	1
deeply	1
corrupted	1
themselves,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
therefore	1
he	1
will	1
remember	1
their	1
iniquity,	1
he	1
will	1
visit	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
9:10	1
I	1
found	1
Israel	1
like	1
grapes	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness;	1
I	1
saw	1
your	1
fathers	1
as	1
the	1
firstripe	1
in	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
at	1
her	1
first	1
time:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Baalpeor,	1
and	1
separated	1
themselves	1
unto	1
that	1
shame;	1
and	1
their	1
abominations	1
were	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
loved.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
Ephraim,	1
their	1
glory	1
shall	1
fly	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
bird,	1
from	1
the	1
birth,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
conception.	1
	1
9:12	1
Though	1
they	1
bring	1
up	1
their	1
children,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
bereave	1
them,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
left:	1
yea,	1
woe	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
I	1
depart	1
from	1
them!	1
	1
9:13	1
Ephraim,	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
Tyrus,	1
is	1
planted	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
place:	1
but	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
his	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
murderer.	1
	1
9:14	1
Give	1
them,	1
O	1
LORD:	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
give?	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
miscarrying	1
womb	1
and	1
dry	1
breasts.	1
	1
9:15	1
All	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
in	1
Gilgal:	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
hated	1
them:	1
for	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
their	1
doings	1
I	1
will	1
drive	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
mine	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
no	1
more:	1
all	1
their	1
princes	1
are	1
revolters.	1
	1
9:16	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
smitten,	1
their	1
root	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
no	1
fruit:	1
yea,	1
though	1
they	1
bring	1
forth,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
slay	1
even	1
the	1
beloved	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
womb.	1
	1
9:17	1
My	1
God	1
will	1
cast	1
them	1
away,	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hearken	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
wanderers	1
among	1
the	1
nations.	1
	1
10:1	1
Israel	1
is	1
an	1
empty	1
vine,	1
he	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
himself:	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
his	1
fruit	1
he	1
hath	1
increased	1
the	1
altars;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
his	1
land	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
goodly	1
images.	1
	1
10:2	1
Their	1
heart	1
is	1
divided;	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
found	1
faulty:	1
he	1
shall	1
break	1
down	1
their	1
altars,	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
their	1
images.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
now	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king,	1
because	1
we	1
feared	1
not	1
the	1
LORD;	1
what	1
then	1
should	1
a	1
king	1
do	1
to	1
us?	1
	1
10:4	1
They	1
have	1
spoken	1
words,	1
swearing	1
falsely	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
covenant:	1
thus	1
judgment	1
springeth	1
up	1
as	1
hemlock	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:5	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
Bethaven:	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
thereof	1
shall	1
mourn	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
that	1
rejoiced	1
on	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
thereof,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
it.	1
	1
10:6	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
carried	1
unto	1
Assyria	1
for	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
king	1
Jareb:	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
receive	1
shame,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
counsel.	1
	1
10:7	1
As	1
for	1
Samaria,	1
her	1
king	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
the	1
foam	1
upon	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
10:8	1
The	1
high	1
places	1
also	1
of	1
Aven,	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed:	1
the	1
thorn	1
and	1
the	1
thistle	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
their	1
altars;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Cover	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
10:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
sinned	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Gibeah:	1
there	1
they	1
stood:	1
the	1
battle	1
in	1
Gibeah	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
iniquity	1
did	1
not	1
overtake	1
them.	1
	1
10:10	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
desire	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
chastise	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
against	1
them,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
bind	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
two	1
furrows.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
as	1
an	1
heifer	1
that	1
is	1
taught,	1
and	1
loveth	1
to	1
tread	1
out	1
the	1
corn;	1
but	1
I	1
passed	1
over	1
upon	1
her	1
fair	1
neck:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Ephraim	1
to	1
ride;	1
Judah	1
shall	1
plow,	1
and	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
break	1
his	1
clods.	1
	1
10:12	1
Sow	1
to	1
yourselves	1
in	1
righteousness,	1
reap	1
in	1
mercy;	1
break	1
up	1
your	1
fallow	1
ground:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
till	1
he	1
come	1
and	1
rain	1
righteousness	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
10:13	1
Ye	1
have	1
plowed	1
wickedness,	1
ye	1
have	1
reaped	1
iniquity;	1
ye	1
have	1
eaten	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
lies:	1
because	1
thou	1
didst	1
trust	1
in	1
thy	1
way,	1
in	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men.	1
	1
10:14	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
a	1
tumult	1
arise	1
among	1
thy	1
people,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
fortresses	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled,	1
as	1
Shalman	1
spoiled	1
Betharbel	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle:	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
upon	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
10:15	1
So	1
shall	1
Bethel	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
wickedness:	1
in	1
a	1
morning	1
shall	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel	1
utterly	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:1	1
When	1
Israel	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
then	1
I	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
my	1
son	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
11:2	1
As	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
from	1
them:	1
they	1
sacrificed	1
unto	1
Baalim,	1
and	1
burned	1
incense	1
to	1
graven	1
images.	1
	1
11:3	1
I	1
taught	1
Ephraim	1
also	1
to	1
go,	1
taking	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
arms;	1
but	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
I	1
drew	1
them	1
with	1
cords	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
with	1
bands	1
of	1
love:	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
yoke	1
on	1
their	1
jaws,	1
and	1
I	1
laid	1
meat	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
11:5	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
be	1
his	1
king,	1
because	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
abide	1
on	1
his	1
cities,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
his	1
branches,	1
and	1
devour	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
counsels.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
my	1
people	1
are	1
bent	1
to	1
backsliding	1
from	1
me:	1
though	1
they	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
High,	1
none	1
at	1
all	1
would	1
exalt	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
How	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
up,	1
Ephraim?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
deliver	1
thee,	1
Israel?	1
	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
Admah?	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
Zeboim?	1
mine	1
heart	1
is	1
turned	1
within	1
me,	1
my	1
repentings	1
are	1
kindled	1
together.	1
	1
11:9	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
execute	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
mine	1
anger,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
destroy	1
Ephraim:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
God,	1
and	1
not	1
man;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:10	1
They	1
shall	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
LORD:	1
he	1
shall	1
roar	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
roar,	1
then	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
tremble	1
from	1
the	1
west.	1
	1
11:11	1
They	1
shall	1
tremble	1
as	1
a	1
bird	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
dove	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
houses,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
Ephraim	1
compasseth	1
me	1
about	1
with	1
lies,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
deceit:	1
but	1
Judah	1
yet	1
ruleth	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
is	1
faithful	1
with	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
12:1	1
Ephraim	1
feedeth	1
on	1
wind,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
the	1
east	1
wind:	1
he	1
daily	1
increaseth	1
lies	1
and	1
desolation;	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
make	1
a	1
covenant	1
with	1
the	1
Assyrians,	1
and	1
oil	1
is	1
carried	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
12:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
also	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
punish	1
Jacob	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ways;	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
doings	1
will	1
he	1
recompense	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
brother	1
by	1
the	1
heel	1
in	1
the	1
womb,	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
with	1
God:	1
12:4	1
Yea,	1
he	1
had	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
angel,	1
and	1
prevailed:	1
he	1
wept,	1
and	1
made	1
supplication	1
unto	1
him:	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
spake	1
with	1
us;	1
12:5	1
Even	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
memorial.	1
	1
12:6	1
Therefore	1
turn	1
thou	1
to	1
thy	1
God:	1
keep	1
mercy	1
and	1
judgment	1
and	1
wait	1
on	1
thy	1
God	1
continually.	1
	1
12:7	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
merchant,	1
the	1
balances	1
of	1
deceit	1
are	1
in	1
his	1
hand:	1
he	1
loveth	1
to	1
oppress.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
Ephraim	1
said,	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
rich,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
me	1
out	1
substance:	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
labours	1
they	1
shall	1
find	1
none	1
iniquity	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
were	1
sin.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
yet	1
make	1
thee	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
tabernacles,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
solemn	1
feast.	1
	1
12:10	1
I	1
have	1
also	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
multiplied	1
visions,	1
and	1
used	1
similitudes,	1
by	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
12:11	1
Is	1
there	1
iniquity	1
in	1
Gilead?	1
surely	1
they	1
are	1
vanity:	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
bullocks	1
in	1
Gilgal;	1
yea,	1
their	1
altars	1
are	1
as	1
heaps	1
in	1
the	1
furrows	1
of	1
the	1
fields.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
Jacob	1
fled	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Syria,	1
and	1
Israel	1
served	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
wife	1
he	1
kept	1
sheep.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
the	1
LORD	1
brought	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
prophet	1
was	1
he	1
preserved.	1
	1
12:14	1
Ephraim	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
anger	1
most	1
bitterly:	1
therefore	1
shall	1
he	1
leave	1
his	1
blood	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
reproach	1
shall	1
his	1
LORD	1
return	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:1	1
When	1
Ephraim	1
spake	1
trembling,	1
he	1
exalted	1
himself	1
in	1
Israel;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
offended	1
in	1
Baal,	1
he	1
died.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
sin	1
more	1
and	1
more,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
molten	1
images	1
of	1
their	1
silver,	1
and	1
idols	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
understanding,	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
craftsmen:	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
them,	1
Let	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
kiss	1
the	1
calves.	1
	1
13:3	1
Therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
cloud	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
early	1
dew	1
that	1
passeth	1
away,	1
as	1
the	1
chaff	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
with	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
smoke	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chimney.	1
	1
13:4	1
Yet	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
no	1
god	1
but	1
me:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
saviour	1
beside	1
me.	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
did	1
know	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
great	1
drought.	1
	1
13:6	1
According	1
to	1
their	1
pasture,	1
so	1
were	1
they	1
filled;	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
exalted;	1
therefore	1
have	1
they	1
forgotten	1
me.	1
	1
13:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
lion:	1
as	1
a	1
leopard	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
will	1
I	1
observe	1
them:	1
13:8	1
I	1
will	1
meet	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
that	1
is	1
bereaved	1
of	1
her	1
whelps,	1
and	1
will	1
rend	1
the	1
caul	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
devour	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
lion:	1
the	1
wild	1
beast	1
shall	1
tear	1
them.	1
	1
13:9	1
O	1
Israel,	1
thou	1
hast	1
destroyed	1
thyself;	1
but	1
in	1
me	1
is	1
thine	1
help.	1
	1
13:10	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
king:	1
where	1
is	1
any	1
other	1
that	1
may	1
save	1
thee	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
cities?	1
and	1
thy	1
judges	1
of	1
whom	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
Give	1
me	1
a	1
king	1
and	1
princes?	1
	1
13:11	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
a	1
king	1
in	1
mine	1
anger,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
in	1
my	1
wrath.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
iniquity	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
is	1
bound	1
up;	1
his	1
sin	1
is	1
hid.	1
	1
13:13	1
The	1
sorrows	1
of	1
a	1
travailing	1
woman	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him:	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
unwise	1
son;	1
for	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
stay	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
breaking	1
forth	1
of	1
children.	1
	1
13:14	1
I	1
will	1
ransom	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
grave;	1
I	1
will	1
redeem	1
them	1
from	1
death:	1
O	1
death,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
plagues;	1
O	1
grave,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
destruction:	1
repentance	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
13:15	1
Though	1
he	1
be	1
fruitful	1
among	1
his	1
brethren,	1
an	1
east	1
wind	1
shall	1
come,	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
his	1
spring	1
shall	1
become	1
dry,	1
and	1
his	1
fountain	1
shall	1
be	1
dried	1
up:	1
he	1
shall	1
spoil	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
all	1
pleasant	1
vessels.	1
	1
13:16	1
Samaria	1
shall	1
become	1
desolate;	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
rebelled	1
against	1
her	1
God:	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword:	1
their	1
infants	1
shall	1
be	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
their	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
shall	1
be	1
ripped	1
up.	1
	1
14:1	1
O	1
israel,	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God;	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
fallen	1
by	1
thine	1
iniquity.	1
	1
14:2	1
Take	1
with	1
you	1
words,	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
LORD:	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
away	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
receive	1
us	1
graciously:	1
so	1
will	1
we	1
render	1
the	1
calves	1
of	1
our	1
lips.	1
	1
14:3	1
Asshur	1
shall	1
not	1
save	1
us;	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
ride	1
upon	1
horses:	1
neither	1
will	1
we	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
Ye	1
are	1
our	1
gods:	1
for	1
in	1
thee	1
the	1
fatherless	1
findeth	1
mercy.	1
	1
14:4	1
I	1
will	1
heal	1
their	1
backsliding,	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
them	1
freely:	1
for	1
mine	1
anger	1
is	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
dew	1
unto	1
Israel:	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
lily,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
his	1
roots	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:6	1
His	1
branches	1
shall	1
spread,	1
and	1
his	1
beauty	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
and	1
his	1
smell	1
as	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:7	1
They	1
that	1
dwell	1
under	1
his	1
shadow	1
shall	1
return;	1
they	1
shall	1
revive	1
as	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
grow	1
as	1
the	1
vine:	1
the	1
scent	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
Lebanon.	1
	1
14:8	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
more	1
with	1
idols?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
observed	1
him:	1
I	1
am	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
fir	1
tree.	1
From	1
me	1
is	1
thy	1
fruit	1
found.	1
	1
14:9	1
Who	1
is	1
wise,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
understand	1
these	1
things?	1
prudent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
are	1
right,	1
and	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
walk	1
in	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
transgressors	1
shall	1
fall	1
therein.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Joel	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Joel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Pethuel.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear	1
this,	1
ye	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
give	1
ear,	1
all	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
Hath	1
this	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
	1
1:3	1
Tell	1
ye	1
your	1
children	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
children	1
tell	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
their	1
children	1
another	1
generation.	1
	1
1:4	1
That	1
which	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
locust	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
eaten;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
hath	1
left	1
hath	1
the	1
caterpiller	1
eaten.	1
	1
1:5	1
Awake,	1
ye	1
drunkards,	1
and	1
weep;	1
and	1
howl,	1
all	1
ye	1
drinkers	1
of	1
wine,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
wine;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
your	1
mouth.	1
	1
1:6	1
For	1
a	1
nation	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
upon	1
my	1
land,	1
strong,	1
and	1
without	1
number,	1
whose	1
teeth	1
are	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
the	1
cheek	1
teeth	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
lion.	1
	1
1:7	1
He	1
hath	1
laid	1
my	1
vine	1
waste,	1
and	1
barked	1
my	1
fig	1
tree:	1
he	1
hath	1
made	1
it	1
clean	1
bare,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
away;	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof	1
are	1
made	1
white.	1
	1
1:8	1
Lament	1
like	1
a	1
virgin	1
girded	1
with	1
sackcloth	1
for	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
her	1
youth.	1
	1
1:9	1
The	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
ministers,	1
mourn.	1
	1
1:10	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
wasted,	1
the	1
land	1
mourneth;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
wasted:	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
the	1
oil	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:11	1
Be	1
ye	1
ashamed,	1
O	1
ye	1
husbandmen;	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
vinedressers,	1
for	1
the	1
wheat	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
barley;	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
is	1
perished.	1
	1
1:12	1
The	1
vine	1
is	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
languisheth;	1
the	1
pomegranate	1
tree,	1
the	1
palm	1
tree	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
apple	1
tree,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
are	1
withered:	1
because	1
joy	1
is	1
withered	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:13	1
Gird	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
lament,	1
ye	1
priests:	1
howl,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
altar:	1
come,	1
lie	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
sackcloth,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
my	1
God:	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
the	1
drink	1
offering	1
is	1
withholden	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
Sanctify	1
ye	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
gather	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
1:15	1
Alas	1
for	1
the	1
day!	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
destruction	1
from	1
the	1
Almighty	1
shall	1
it	1
come.	1
	1
1:16	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
meat	1
cut	1
off	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
yea,	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
God?	1
	1
1:17	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
rotten	1
under	1
their	1
clods,	1
the	1
garners	1
are	1
laid	1
desolate,	1
the	1
barns	1
are	1
broken	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
corn	1
is	1
withered.	1
	1
1:18	1
How	1
do	1
the	1
beasts	1
groan!	1
the	1
herds	1
of	1
cattle	1
are	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
pasture;	1
yea,	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
are	1
made	1
desolate.	1
	1
1:19	1
O	1
LORD,	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
I	1
cry:	1
for	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
the	1
flame	1
hath	1
burned	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
1:20	1
The	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
cry	1
also	1
unto	1
thee:	1
for	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
waters	1
are	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
hath	1
devoured	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:1	1
Blow	1
ye	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
sound	1
an	1
alarm	1
in	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
tremble:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand;	1
2:2	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
of	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
of	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains:	1
a	1
great	1
people	1
and	1
a	1
strong;	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
been	1
ever	1
the	1
like,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
after	1
it,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
many	1
generations.	1
	1
2:3	1
A	1
fire	1
devoureth	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
flame	1
burneth:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
garden	1
of	1
Eden	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness;	1
yea,	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
escape	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
horses;	1
and	1
as	1
horsemen,	1
so	1
shall	1
they	1
run.	1
	1
2:5	1
Like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
chariots	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
mountains	1
shall	1
they	1
leap,	1
like	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
that	1
devoureth	1
the	1
stubble,	1
as	1
a	1
strong	1
people	1
set	1
in	1
battle	1
array.	1
	1
2:6	1
Before	1
their	1
face	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
pained:	1
all	1
faces	1
shall	1
gather	1
blackness.	1
	1
2:7	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
mighty	1
men;	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
men	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
march	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
break	1
their	1
ranks:	1
2:8	1
Neither	1
shall	1
one	1
thrust	1
another;	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
path:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
sword,	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wounded.	1
	1
2:9	1
They	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
the	1
city;	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
wall,	1
they	1
shall	1
climb	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
houses;	1
they	1
shall	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
like	1
a	1
thief.	1
	1
2:10	1
The	1
earth	1
shall	1
quake	1
before	1
them;	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
tremble:	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
dark,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining:	1
2:11	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
before	1
his	1
army:	1
for	1
his	1
camp	1
is	1
very	1
great:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
strong	1
that	1
executeth	1
his	1
word:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
very	1
terrible;	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
it?	1
2:12	1
Therefore	1
also	1
now,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
turn	1
ye	1
even	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
fasting,	1
and	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
mourning:	1
2:13	1
And	1
rend	1
your	1
heart,	1
and	1
not	1
your	1
garments,	1
and	1
turn	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
gracious	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repenteth	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
2:14	1
Who	1
knoweth	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
leave	1
a	1
blessing	1
behind	1
him;	1
even	1
a	1
meat	1
offering	1
and	1
a	1
drink	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God?	1
	1
2:15	1
Blow	1
the	1
trumpet	1
in	1
Zion,	1
sanctify	1
a	1
fast,	1
call	1
a	1
solemn	1
assembly:	1
2:16	1
Gather	1
the	1
people,	1
sanctify	1
the	1
congregation,	1
assemble	1
the	1
elders,	1
gather	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
suck	1
the	1
breasts:	1
let	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
the	1
bride	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
closet.	1
	1
2:17	1
Let	1
the	1
priests,	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
weep	1
between	1
the	1
porch	1
and	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
say,	1
Spare	1
thy	1
people,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
and	1
give	1
not	1
thine	1
heritage	1
to	1
reproach,	1
that	1
the	1
heathen	1
should	1
rule	1
over	1
them:	1
wherefore	1
should	1
they	1
say	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
Where	1
is	1
their	1
God?	1
2:18	1
Then	1
will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
jealous	1
for	1
his	1
land,	1
and	1
pity	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
2:19	1
Yea,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
people,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
you	1
corn,	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
oil,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
therewith:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
reproach	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
2:20	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
far	1
off	1
from	1
you	1
the	1
northern	1
army,	1
and	1
will	1
drive	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
land	1
barren	1
and	1
desolate,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
hinder	1
part	1
toward	1
the	1
utmost	1
sea,	1
and	1
his	1
stink	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
ill	1
savour	1
shall	1
come	1
up,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:21	1
Fear	1
not,	1
O	1
land;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
do	1
great	1
things.	1
	1
2:22	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
ye	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
field:	1
for	1
the	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness	1
do	1
spring,	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
beareth	1
her	1
fruit,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
and	1
the	1
vine	1
do	1
yield	1
their	1
strength.	1
	1
2:23	1
Be	1
glad	1
then,	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
former	1
rain	1
moderately,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
cause	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
you	1
the	1
rain,	1
the	1
former	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
month.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
floors	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
the	1
vats	1
shall	1
overflow	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
oil.	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
restore	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
the	1
locust	1
hath	1
eaten,	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
and	1
the	1
caterpiller,	1
and	1
the	1
palmerworm,	1
my	1
great	1
army	1
which	1
I	1
sent	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat	1
in	1
plenty,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
praise	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
that	1
hath	1
dealt	1
wondrously	1
with	1
you:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God,	1
and	1
none	1
else:	1
and	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
2:28	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh;	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams,	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions:	1
2:29	1
And	1
also	1
upon	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
handmaids	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
will	1
I	1
pour	1
out	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
2:30	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
pillars	1
of	1
smoke.	1
	1
2:31	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
terrible	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come.	1
	1
2:32	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered:	1
for	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
said,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
remnant	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
3:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
3:2	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
gather	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat,	1
and	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
for	1
my	1
people	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
heritage	1
Israel,	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
scattered	1
among	1
the	1
nations,	1
and	1
parted	1
my	1
land.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
boy	1
for	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
sold	1
a	1
girl	1
for	1
wine,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
drink.	1
	1
3:4	1
Yea,	1
and	1
what	1
have	1
ye	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me,	1
O	1
Tyre,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Palestine?	1
will	1
ye	1
render	1
me	1
a	1
recompence?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
recompense	1
me,	1
swiftly	1
and	1
speedily	1
will	1
I	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head;	1
3:5	1
Because	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
my	1
silver	1
and	1
my	1
gold,	1
and	1
have	1
carried	1
into	1
your	1
temples	1
my	1
goodly	1
pleasant	1
things:	1
3:6	1
The	1
children	1
also	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
have	1
ye	1
sold	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
remove	1
them	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
3:7	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
ye	1
have	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
will	1
return	1
your	1
recompence	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
head:	1
3:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sell	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
sell	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Sabeans,	1
to	1
a	1
people	1
far	1
off:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
3:9	1
Proclaim	1
ye	1
this	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
Prepare	1
war,	1
wake	1
up	1
the	1
mighty	1
men,	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
draw	1
near;	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
up:	1
3:10	1
Beat	1
your	1
plowshares	1
into	1
swords	1
and	1
your	1
pruninghooks	1
into	1
spears:	1
let	1
the	1
weak	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
strong.	1
	1
3:11	1
Assemble	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
come,	1
all	1
ye	1
heathen,	1
and	1
gather	1
yourselves	1
together	1
round	1
about:	1
thither	1
cause	1
thy	1
mighty	1
ones	1
to	1
come	1
down,	1
O	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:12	1
Let	1
the	1
heathen	1
be	1
wakened,	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Jehoshaphat:	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
sit	1
to	1
judge	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
3:13	1
Put	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
for	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
ripe:	1
come,	1
get	1
you	1
down;	1
for	1
the	1
press	1
is	1
full,	1
the	1
fats	1
overflow;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
great.	1
	1
3:14	1
Multitudes,	1
multitudes	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
decision.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
withdraw	1
their	1
shining.	1
	1
3:16	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
roar	1
out	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
shake:	1
but	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
3:17	1
So	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God	1
dwelling	1
in	1
Zion,	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain:	1
then	1
shall	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
holy,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
strangers	1
pass	1
through	1
her	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
down	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
flow	1
with	1
waters,	1
and	1
a	1
fountain	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
water	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Shittim.	1
	1
3:19	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
Edom	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
desolate	1
wilderness,	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
against	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
innocent	1
blood	1
in	1
their	1
land.	1
	1
3:20	1
But	1
Judah	1
shall	1
dwell	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
3:21	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
cleanse	1
their	1
blood	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
cleansed:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
Zion.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Amos	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Amos,	1
who	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
herdmen	1
of	1
Tekoa,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joash	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
two	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake.	1
	1
1:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
roar	1
from	1
Zion,	1
and	1
utter	1
his	1
voice	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
habitations	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
and	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel	1
shall	1
wither.	1
	1
1:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
threshed	1
Gilead	1
with	1
threshing	1
instruments	1
of	1
iron:	1
1:4	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Hazael,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Benhadad.	1
	1
1:5	1
I	1
will	1
break	1
also	1
the	1
bar	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
the	1
plain	1
of	1
Aven,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Eden:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Syria	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
unto	1
Kir,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity,	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
Edom:	1
1:7	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof:	1
1:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
from	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
holdeth	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
Ashkelon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
against	1
Ekron:	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines	1
shall	1
perish,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
captivity	1
to	1
Edom,	1
and	1
remembered	1
not	1
the	1
brotherly	1
covenant:	1
1:10	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Tyrus,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
pursue	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
off	1
all	1
pity,	1
and	1
his	1
anger	1
did	1
tear	1
perpetually,	1
and	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
wrath	1
for	1
ever:	1
1:12	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Teman,	1
which	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Bozrah.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
ripped	1
up	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
Gilead,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enlarge	1
their	1
border:	1
1:14	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
kindle	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
Rabbah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
thereof,	1
with	1
shouting	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle,	1
with	1
a	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
whirlwind:	1
1:15	1
And	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
princes	1
together,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:1	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
he	1
burned	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Edom	1
into	1
lime:	1
2:2	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Moab,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Kirioth:	1
and	1
Moab	1
shall	1
die	1
with	1
tumult,	1
with	1
shouting,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet:	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
will	1
slay	1
all	1
the	1
princes	1
thereof	1
with	1
him,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
despised	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
his	1
commandments,	1
and	1
their	1
lies	1
caused	1
them	1
to	1
err,	1
after	1
the	1
which	1
their	1
fathers	1
have	1
walked:	1
2:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
fire	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
devour	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
For	1
three	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
for	1
four,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
punishment	1
thereof;	1
because	1
they	1
sold	1
the	1
righteous	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
2:7	1
That	1
pant	1
after	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
meek:	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
same	1
maid,	1
to	1
profane	1
my	1
holy	1
name:	1
2:8	1
And	1
they	1
lay	1
themselves	1
down	1
upon	1
clothes	1
laid	1
to	1
pledge	1
by	1
every	1
altar,	1
and	1
they	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
their	1
god.	1
	1
2:9	1
Yet	1
destroyed	1
I	1
the	1
Amorite	1
before	1
them,	1
whose	1
height	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
cedars,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
strong	1
as	1
the	1
oaks;	1
yet	1
I	1
destroyed	1
his	1
fruit	1
from	1
above,	1
and	1
his	1
roots	1
from	1
beneath.	1
	1
2:10	1
Also	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
led	1
you	1
forty	1
years	1
through	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Amorite.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
I	1
raised	1
up	1
of	1
your	1
sons	1
for	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
for	1
Nazarites.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
even	1
thus,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:12	1
But	1
ye	1
gave	1
the	1
Nazarites	1
wine	1
to	1
drink;	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy	1
not.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
pressed	1
under	1
you,	1
as	1
a	1
cart	1
is	1
pressed	1
that	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
sheaves.	1
	1
2:14	1
Therefore	1
the	1
flight	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
the	1
swift,	1
and	1
the	1
strong	1
shall	1
not	1
strengthen	1
his	1
force,	1
neither	1
shall	1
the	1
mighty	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
2:15	1
Neither	1
shall	1
he	1
stand	1
that	1
handleth	1
the	1
bow;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
swift	1
of	1
foot	1
shall	1
not	1
deliver	1
himself:	1
neither	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
rideth	1
the	1
horse	1
deliver	1
himself.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
courageous	1
among	1
the	1
mighty	1
shall	1
flee	1
away	1
naked	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
against	1
you,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
against	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
which	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
You	1
only	1
have	1
I	1
known	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
therefore	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
you	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
iniquities.	1
	1
3:3	1
Can	1
two	1
walk	1
together,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
agreed?	1
	1
3:4	1
Will	1
a	1
lion	1
roar	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
prey?	1
will	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
den,	1
if	1
he	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing?	1
	1
3:5	1
Can	1
a	1
bird	1
fall	1
in	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
where	1
no	1
gin	1
is	1
for	1
him?	1
	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
snare	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing	1
at	1
all?	1
	1
3:6	1
Shall	1
a	1
trumpet	1
be	1
blown	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
not	1
be	1
afraid?	1
	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
evil	1
in	1
a	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
not	1
done	1
it?	1
	1
3:7	1
Surely	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
will	1
do	1
nothing,	1
but	1
he	1
revealeth	1
his	1
secret	1
unto	1
his	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
lion	1
hath	1
roared,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
fear?	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
spoken,	1
who	1
can	1
but	1
prophesy?	1
	1
3:9	1
Publish	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
at	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
palaces	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
say,	1
Assemble	1
yourselves	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
great	1
tumults	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
oppressed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
right,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
who	1
store	1
up	1
violence	1
and	1
robbery	1
in	1
their	1
palaces.	1
	1
3:11	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
An	1
adversary	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
down	1
thy	1
strength	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
palaces	1
shall	1
be	1
spoiled.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
As	1
the	1
shepherd	1
taketh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
lion	1
two	1
legs,	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
an	1
ear;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
taken	1
out	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Samaria	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
bed,	1
and	1
in	1
Damascus	1
in	1
a	1
couch.	1
	1
3:13	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
and	1
testify	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
3:14	1
That	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
visit	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
upon	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
visit	1
the	1
altars	1
of	1
Bethel:	1
and	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
winter	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
summer	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
ivory	1
shall	1
perish,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
houses	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
end,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:1	1
Hear	1
this	1
word,	1
ye	1
kine	1
of	1
Bashan,	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
oppress	1
the	1
poor,	1
which	1
crush	1
the	1
needy,	1
which	1
say	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
Bring,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
drink.	1
	1
4:2	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
his	1
holiness,	1
that,	1
lo,	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
hooks,	1
and	1
your	1
posterity	1
with	1
fishhooks.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
breaches,	1
every	1
cow	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
her;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
palace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:4	1
Come	1
to	1
Bethel,	1
and	1
transgress;	1
at	1
Gilgal	1
multiply	1
transgression;	1
and	1
bring	1
your	1
sacrifices	1
every	1
morning,	1
and	1
your	1
tithes	1
after	1
three	1
years:	1
4:5	1
And	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
thanksgiving	1
with	1
leaven,	1
and	1
proclaim	1
and	1
publish	1
the	1
free	1
offerings:	1
for	1
this	1
liketh	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
I	1
also	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
cleanness	1
of	1
teeth	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
cities,	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
places:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
withholden	1
the	1
rain	1
from	1
you,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
yet	1
three	1
months	1
to	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
I	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
one	1
city,	1
and	1
caused	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
rain	1
upon	1
another	1
city:	1
one	1
piece	1
was	1
rained	1
upon,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
whereupon	1
it	1
rained	1
not	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
So	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
cities	1
wandered	1
unto	1
one	1
city,	1
to	1
drink	1
water;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
satisfied:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:9	1
I	1
have	1
smitten	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
mildew:	1
when	1
your	1
gardens	1
and	1
your	1
vineyards	1
and	1
your	1
fig	1
trees	1
and	1
your	1
olive	1
trees	1
increased,	1
the	1
palmerworm	1
devoured	1
them:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:10	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
among	1
you	1
the	1
pestilence	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Egypt:	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
have	1
I	1
slain	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
your	1
horses;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
stink	1
of	1
your	1
camps	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
unto	1
your	1
nostrils:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:11	1
I	1
have	1
overthrown	1
some	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
God	1
overthrew	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrah,	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
as	1
a	1
firebrand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
burning:	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
returned	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
4:12	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
will	1
I	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
Israel:	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
unto	1
thee,	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
thy	1
God,	1
O	1
Israel.	1
	1
4:13	1
For,	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
formeth	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
createth	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
declareth	1
unto	1
man	1
what	1
is	1
his	1
thought,	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
morning	1
darkness,	1
and	1
treadeth	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
The	1
LORD,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
this	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
against	1
you,	1
even	1
a	1
lamentation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:2	1
The	1
virgin	1
of	1
Israel	1
is	1
fallen;	1
she	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
rise:	1
she	1
is	1
forsaken	1
upon	1
her	1
land;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD;	1
The	1
city	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
shall	1
leave	1
an	1
hundred,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
went	1
forth	1
by	1
an	1
hundred	1
shall	1
leave	1
ten,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Seek	1
ye	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live:	1
5:5	1
But	1
seek	1
not	1
Bethel,	1
nor	1
enter	1
into	1
Gilgal,	1
and	1
pass	1
not	1
to	1
Beersheba:	1
for	1
Gilgal	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
Bethel	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:6	1
Seek	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
live;	1
lest	1
he	1
break	1
out	1
like	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
devour	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
to	1
quench	1
it	1
in	1
Bethel.	1
	1
5:7	1
Ye	1
who	1
turn	1
judgment	1
to	1
wormwood,	1
and	1
leave	1
off	1
righteousness	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
5:8	1
Seek	1
him	1
that	1
maketh	1
the	1
seven	1
stars	1
and	1
Orion,	1
and	1
turneth	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
into	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
maketh	1
the	1
day	1
dark	1
with	1
night:	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name:	1
5:9	1
That	1
strengtheneth	1
the	1
spoiled	1
against	1
the	1
strong,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
spoiled	1
shall	1
come	1
against	1
the	1
fortress.	1
	1
5:10	1
They	1
hate	1
him	1
that	1
rebuketh	1
in	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
they	1
abhor	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
uprightly.	1
	1
5:11	1
Forasmuch	1
therefore	1
as	1
your	1
treading	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
ye	1
take	1
from	1
him	1
burdens	1
of	1
wheat:	1
ye	1
have	1
built	1
houses	1
of	1
hewn	1
stone,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
dwell	1
in	1
them;	1
ye	1
have	1
planted	1
pleasant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
drink	1
wine	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
manifold	1
transgressions	1
and	1
your	1
mighty	1
sins:	1
they	1
afflict	1
the	1
just,	1
they	1
take	1
a	1
bribe,	1
and	1
they	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
the	1
gate	1
from	1
their	1
right.	1
	1
5:13	1
Therefore	1
the	1
prudent	1
shall	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
that	1
time;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
time.	1
	1
5:14	1
Seek	1
good,	1
and	1
not	1
evil,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
live:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken.	1
	1
5:15	1
Hate	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
establish	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
gate:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
of	1
hosts	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
5:16	1
Therefore	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
LORD,	1
saith	1
thus;	1
Wailing	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
streets;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
highways,	1
Alas!	1
alas!	1
	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
the	1
husbandman	1
to	1
mourning,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
skilful	1
of	1
lamentation	1
to	1
wailing.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
in	1
all	1
vineyards	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
5:18	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
desire	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD!	1
to	1
what	1
end	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
you?	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light.	1
	1
5:19	1
As	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
did	1
flee	1
from	1
a	1
lion,	1
and	1
a	1
bear	1
met	1
him;	1
or	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
a	1
serpent	1
bit	1
him.	1
	1
5:20	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
darkness,	1
and	1
not	1
light?	1
even	1
very	1
dark,	1
and	1
no	1
brightness	1
in	1
it?	1
	1
5:21	1
I	1
hate,	1
I	1
despise	1
your	1
feast	1
days,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
smell	1
in	1
your	1
solemn	1
assemblies.	1
	1
5:22	1
Though	1
ye	1
offer	1
me	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
your	1
meat	1
offerings,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
them:	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
regard	1
the	1
peace	1
offerings	1
of	1
your	1
fat	1
beasts.	1
	1
5:23	1
Take	1
thou	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
thy	1
songs;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
melody	1
of	1
thy	1
viols.	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
let	1
judgment	1
run	1
down	1
as	1
waters,	1
and	1
righteousness	1
as	1
a	1
mighty	1
stream.	1
	1
5:25	1
Have	1
ye	1
offered	1
unto	1
me	1
sacrifices	1
and	1
offerings	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel?	1
	1
5:26	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
your	1
Moloch	1
and	1
Chiun	1
your	1
images,	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god,	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
yourselves.	1
	1
5:27	1
Therefore	1
will	1
I	1
cause	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
beyond	1
Damascus,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
6:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
Zion,	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
are	1
named	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
came!	1
	1
6:2	1
Pass	1
ye	1
unto	1
Calneh,	1
and	1
see;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
go	1
ye	1
to	1
Hamath	1
the	1
great:	1
then	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Gath	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
be	1
they	1
better	1
than	1
these	1
kingdoms?	1
or	1
their	1
border	1
greater	1
than	1
your	1
border?	1
6:3	1
Ye	1
that	1
put	1
far	1
away	1
the	1
evil	1
day,	1
and	1
cause	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
violence	1
to	1
come	1
near;	1
6:4	1
That	1
lie	1
upon	1
beds	1
of	1
ivory,	1
and	1
stretch	1
themselves	1
upon	1
their	1
couches,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
lambs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
calves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
stall;	1
6:5	1
That	1
chant	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
viol,	1
and	1
invent	1
to	1
themselves	1
instruments	1
of	1
musick,	1
like	1
David;	1
6:6	1
That	1
drink	1
wine	1
in	1
bowls,	1
and	1
anoint	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
ointments:	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
6:7	1
Therefore	1
now	1
shall	1
they	1
go	1
captive	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
go	1
captive,	1
and	1
the	1
banquet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
shall	1
be	1
removed.	1
	1
6:8	1
The	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
himself,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
abhor	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
hate	1
his	1
palaces:	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
therein.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
there	1
remain	1
ten	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
house,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
die.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
uncle	1
shall	1
take	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
burneth	1
him,	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
the	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
Is	1
there	1
yet	1
any	1
with	1
thee?	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
No.	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
tongue:	1
for	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:11	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
commandeth,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
with	1
breaches,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
house	1
with	1
clefts.	1
	1
6:12	1
Shall	1
horses	1
run	1
upon	1
the	1
rock?	1
will	1
one	1
plow	1
there	1
with	1
oxen?	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
turned	1
judgment	1
into	1
gall,	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
righteousness	1
into	1
hemlock:	1
6:13	1
Ye	1
which	1
rejoice	1
in	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
nought,	1
which	1
say,	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
taken	1
to	1
us	1
horns	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
strength?	1
	1
6:14	1
But,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
against	1
you	1
a	1
nation,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
afflict	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
entering	1
in	1
of	1
Hemath	1
unto	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
7:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
formed	1
grasshoppers	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
shooting	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
growth;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
latter	1
growth	1
after	1
the	1
king's	1
mowings.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
eating	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
then	1
I	1
said,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
forgive,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
It	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
7:4	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
called	1
to	1
contend	1
by	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
devoured	1
the	1
great	1
deep,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
up	1
a	1
part.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
cease,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee:	1
by	1
whom	1
shall	1
Jacob	1
arise?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
small.	1
	1
7:6	1
The	1
LORD	1
repented	1
for	1
this:	1
This	1
also	1
shall	1
not	1
be,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD.	1
	1
7:7	1
Thus	1
he	1
shewed	1
me:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
upon	1
a	1
wall	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
plumbline,	1
with	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
plumbline.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
a	1
plumbline	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
Israel:	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
the	1
sanctuaries	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
waste;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jeroboam	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
Amaziah	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Bethel	1
sent	1
to	1
Jeroboam	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saying,	1
Amos	1
hath	1
conspired	1
against	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel:	1
the	1
land	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
all	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
thus	1
Amos	1
saith,	1
Jeroboam	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
land.	1
	1
7:12	1
Also	1
Amaziah	1
said	1
unto	1
Amos,	1
O	1
thou	1
seer,	1
go,	1
flee	1
thee	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
there	1
eat	1
bread,	1
and	1
prophesy	1
there:	1
7:13	1
But	1
prophesy	1
not	1
again	1
any	1
more	1
at	1
Bethel:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
chapel,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
king's	1
court.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Amos,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Amaziah,	1
I	1
was	1
no	1
prophet,	1
neither	1
was	1
I	1
a	1
prophet's	1
son;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
herdman,	1
and	1
a	1
gatherer	1
of	1
sycomore	1
fruit:	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
took	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
followed	1
the	1
flock,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go,	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:16	1
Now	1
therefore	1
hear	1
thou	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
Thou	1
sayest,	1
Prophesy	1
not	1
against	1
Israel,	1
and	1
drop	1
not	1
thy	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Isaac.	1
	1
7:17	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Thy	1
wife	1
shall	1
be	1
an	1
harlot	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thy	1
sons	1
and	1
thy	1
daughters	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
by	1
line;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
die	1
in	1
a	1
polluted	1
land:	1
and	1
Israel	1
shall	1
surely	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
forth	1
of	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
8:1	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
shewed	1
unto	1
me:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Amos,	1
what	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
basket	1
of	1
summer	1
fruit.	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
me,	1
The	1
end	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
again	1
pass	1
by	1
them	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
shall	1
be	1
howlings	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
many	1
dead	1
bodies	1
in	1
every	1
place;	1
they	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
forth	1
with	1
silence.	1
	1
8:4	1
Hear	1
this,	1
O	1
ye	1
that	1
swallow	1
up	1
the	1
needy,	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
to	1
fail,	1
8:5	1
Saying,	1
When	1
will	1
the	1
new	1
moon	1
be	1
gone,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sell	1
corn?	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
set	1
forth	1
wheat,	1
making	1
the	1
ephah	1
small,	1
and	1
the	1
shekel	1
great,	1
and	1
falsifying	1
the	1
balances	1
by	1
deceit?	1
	1
8:6	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
buy	1
the	1
poor	1
for	1
silver,	1
and	1
the	1
needy	1
for	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shoes;	1
yea,	1
and	1
sell	1
the	1
refuse	1
of	1
the	1
wheat?	1
	1
8:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sworn	1
by	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
Surely	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
works.	1
	1
8:8	1
Shall	1
not	1
the	1
land	1
tremble	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
mourn	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein?	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
as	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
and	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
at	1
noon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
darken	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
day:	1
8:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
your	1
feasts	1
into	1
mourning,	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
songs	1
into	1
lamentation;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
up	1
sackcloth	1
upon	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
baldness	1
upon	1
every	1
head;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
an	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
thereof	1
as	1
a	1
bitter	1
day.	1
	1
8:11	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
famine	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
not	1
a	1
famine	1
of	1
bread,	1
nor	1
a	1
thirst	1
for	1
water,	1
but	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
8:12	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
wander	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
east,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
8:13	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
fair	1
virgins	1
and	1
young	1
men	1
faint	1
for	1
thirst.	1
	1
8:14	1
They	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
say,	1
Thy	1
god,	1
O	1
Dan,	1
liveth;	1
and,	1
The	1
manner	1
of	1
Beersheba	1
liveth;	1
even	1
they	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
never	1
rise	1
up	1
again.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD	1
standing	1
upon	1
the	1
altar:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Smite	1
the	1
lintel	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
that	1
the	1
posts	1
may	1
shake:	1
and	1
cut	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
all	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
slay	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
sword:	1
he	1
that	1
fleeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
escapeth	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
9:2	1
Though	1
they	1
dig	1
into	1
hell,	1
thence	1
shall	1
mine	1
hand	1
take	1
them;	1
though	1
they	1
climb	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
them	1
down:	1
9:3	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
hide	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
Carmel,	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
thence;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
hid	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
serpent,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bite	1
them:	1
9:4	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
captivity	1
before	1
their	1
enemies,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
command	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
slay	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
them	1
for	1
evil,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
good.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
of	1
hosts	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
melt,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein	1
shall	1
mourn:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
wholly	1
like	1
a	1
flood;	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
drowned,	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
Egypt.	1
	1
9:6	1
It	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
buildeth	1
his	1
stories	1
in	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
hath	1
founded	1
his	1
troop	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
he	1
that	1
calleth	1
for	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
poureth	1
them	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
9:7	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
unto	1
me,	1
O	1
children	1
of	1
Israel?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
brought	1
up	1
Israel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt?	1
and	1
the	1
Philistines	1
from	1
Caphtor,	1
and	1
the	1
Syrians	1
from	1
Kir?	1
9:8	1
Behold,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
sinful	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
it	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
saving	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
utterly	1
destroy	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:9	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
command,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sift	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
like	1
as	1
corn	1
is	1
sifted	1
in	1
a	1
sieve,	1
yet	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
grain	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:10	1
All	1
the	1
sinners	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
die	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
which	1
say,	1
The	1
evil	1
shall	1
not	1
overtake	1
nor	1
prevent	1
us.	1
	1
9:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David	1
that	1
is	1
fallen,	1
and	1
close	1
up	1
the	1
breaches	1
thereof;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
his	1
ruins,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
it	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old:	1
9:12	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
possess	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen,	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
by	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
doeth	1
this.	1
	1
9:13	1
Behold,	1
the	1
days	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
the	1
plowman	1
shall	1
overtake	1
the	1
reaper,	1
and	1
the	1
treader	1
of	1
grapes	1
him	1
that	1
soweth	1
seed;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
drop	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hills	1
shall	1
melt.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
again	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
waste	1
cities,	1
and	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
and	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof;	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
make	1
gardens,	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
plant	1
them	1
upon	1
their	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
pulled	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Obadiah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
vision	1
of	1
Obadiah.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
concerning	1
Edom;	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
rumour	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
an	1
ambassador	1
is	1
sent	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
in	1
battle.	1
	1
1:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
small	1
among	1
the	1
heathen:	1
thou	1
art	1
greatly	1
despised.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
pride	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
hath	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
thou	1
that	1
dwellest	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rock,	1
whose	1
habitation	1
is	1
high;	1
that	1
saith	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
bring	1
me	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
1:4	1
Though	1
thou	1
exalt	1
thyself	1
as	1
the	1
eagle,	1
and	1
though	1
thou	1
set	1
thy	1
nest	1
among	1
the	1
stars,	1
thence	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
down,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
If	1
thieves	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
if	1
robbers	1
by	1
night,	1
(how	1
art	1
thou	1
cut	1
off!)	1
	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
stolen	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
enough?	1
if	1
the	1
grapegatherers	1
came	1
to	1
thee,	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
leave	1
some	1
grapes?	1
	1
1:6	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
Esau	1
searched	1
out!	1
how	1
are	1
his	1
hidden	1
things	1
sought	1
up!	1
	1
1:7	1
All	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
thy	1
confederacy	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
border:	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
peace	1
with	1
thee	1
have	1
deceived	1
thee,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
thee;	1
that	1
they	1
eat	1
thy	1
bread	1
have	1
laid	1
a	1
wound	1
under	1
thee:	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
understanding	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
Shall	1
I	1
not	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
even	1
destroy	1
the	1
wise	1
men	1
out	1
of	1
Edom,	1
and	1
understanding	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
thy	1
mighty	1
men,	1
O	1
Teman,	1
shall	1
be	1
dismayed,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau	1
may	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
by	1
slaughter.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
thy	1
violence	1
against	1
thy	1
brother	1
Jacob	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thou	1
stoodest	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
strangers	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
his	1
forces,	1
and	1
foreigners	1
entered	1
into	1
his	1
gates,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots	1
upon	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
thou	1
wast	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
brother	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
stranger;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Judah	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
destruction;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
spoken	1
proudly	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
yea,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
not	1
have	1
looked	1
on	1
their	1
affliction	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity,	1
nor	1
have	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
their	1
substance	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
calamity;	1
1:14	1
Neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
crossway,	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
escape;	1
neither	1
shouldest	1
thou	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
did	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
distress.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
heathen:	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
thee:	1
thy	1
reward	1
shall	1
return	1
upon	1
thine	1
own	1
head.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
drunk	1
upon	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain,	1
so	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
drink	1
continually,	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
swallow	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been.	1
	1
1:17	1
But	1
upon	1
mount	1
Zion	1
shall	1
be	1
deliverance,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
possess	1
their	1
possessions.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph	1
a	1
flame,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau	1
for	1
stubble,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kindle	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
devour	1
them;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
remaining	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Esau;	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
the	1
Philistines:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
Samaria:	1
and	1
Benjamin	1
shall	1
possess	1
Gilead.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
this	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
possess	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Canaanites,	1
even	1
unto	1
Zarephath;	1
and	1
the	1
captivity	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Sepharad,	1
shall	1
possess	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
saviours	1
shall	1
come	1
up	1
on	1
mount	1
Zion	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Esau;	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
LORD's.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Jonah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Now	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amittai,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
to	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
cry	1
against	1
it;	1
for	1
their	1
wickedness	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:3	1
But	1
Jonah	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
flee	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
going	1
to	1
Tarshish:	1
so	1
he	1
paid	1
the	1
fare	1
thereof,	1
and	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
it,	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
Tarshish	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
sent	1
out	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mighty	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
1:5	1
Then	1
the	1
mariners	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
cried	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
wares	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
to	1
lighten	1
it	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
Jonah	1
was	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
	1
1:6	1
So	1
the	1
shipmaster	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
meanest	1
thou,	1
O	1
sleeper?	1
arise,	1
call	1
upon	1
thy	1
God,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
God	1
will	1
think	1
upon	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
fellow,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
cast	1
lots,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
know	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us.	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
lots,	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Jonah.	1
	1
1:8	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
we	1
pray	1
thee,	1
for	1
whose	1
cause	1
this	1
evil	1
is	1
upon	1
us;	1
What	1
is	1
thine	1
occupation?	1
and	1
whence	1
comest	1
thou?	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
country?	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
people	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
Hebrew;	1
and	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
heaven,	1
which	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
1:10	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
men	1
exceedingly	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him.	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
this?	1
For	1
the	1
men	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
them.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
the	1
sea	1
may	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
us?	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
me	1
up,	1
and	1
cast	1
me	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
sea	1
be	1
calm	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
this	1
great	1
tempest	1
is	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
1:13	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
men	1
rowed	1
hard	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
land;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not:	1
for	1
the	1
sea	1
wrought,	1
and	1
was	1
tempestuous	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
1:14	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
we	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
perish	1
for	1
this	1
man's	1
life,	1
and	1
lay	1
not	1
upon	1
us	1
innocent	1
blood:	1
for	1
thou,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
hast	1
done	1
as	1
it	1
pleased	1
thee.	1
	1
1:15	1
So	1
they	1
look	1
up	1
Jonah,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
ceased	1
from	1
her	1
raging.	1
	1
1:16	1
Then	1
the	1
men	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
made	1
vows.	1
	1
1:17	1
Now	1
the	1
LORD	1
had	1
prepared	1
a	1
great	1
fish	1
to	1
swallow	1
up	1
Jonah.	1
And	1
Jonah	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights.	1
	1
2:1	1
Then	1
Jonah	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fish's	1
belly,	1
2:2	1
And	1
said,	1
I	1
cried	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
mine	1
affliction	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
heard	1
me;	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
belly	1
of	1
hell	1
cried	1
I,	1
and	1
thou	1
heardest	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
thou	1
hadst	1
cast	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
seas;	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
compassed	1
me	1
about:	1
all	1
thy	1
billows	1
and	1
thy	1
waves	1
passed	1
over	1
me.	1
	1
2:4	1
Then	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
cast	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sight;	1
yet	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
again	1
toward	1
thy	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:5	1
The	1
waters	1
compassed	1
me	1
about,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
soul:	1
the	1
depth	1
closed	1
me	1
round	1
about,	1
the	1
weeds	1
were	1
wrapped	1
about	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
2:6	1
I	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottoms	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
her	1
bars	1
was	1
about	1
me	1
for	1
ever:	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
brought	1
up	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
corruption,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
2:7	1
When	1
my	1
soul	1
fainted	1
within	1
me	1
I	1
remembered	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
my	1
prayer	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
thee,	1
into	1
thine	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
2:8	1
They	1
that	1
observe	1
lying	1
vanities	1
forsake	1
their	1
own	1
mercy.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
thee	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thanksgiving;	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
that	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
vowed.	1
Salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
it	1
vomited	1
out	1
Jonah	1
upon	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Jonah	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
saying,	1
3:2	1
Arise,	1
go	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
it	1
the	1
preaching	1
that	1
I	1
bid	1
thee.	1
	1
3:3	1
So	1
Jonah	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
unto	1
Nineveh,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Now	1
Nineveh	1
was	1
an	1
exceeding	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
three	1
days'	1
journey.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Jonah	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
day's	1
journey,	1
and	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
said,	1
Yet	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
be	1
overthrown.	1
	1
3:5	1
So	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
proclaimed	1
a	1
fast,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
sackcloth,	1
from	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
them	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
word	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Nineveh,	1
and	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
robe	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
ashes.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
and	1
published	1
through	1
Nineveh	1
by	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
his	1
nobles,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
neither	1
man	1
nor	1
beast,	1
herd	1
nor	1
flock,	1
taste	1
any	1
thing:	1
let	1
them	1
not	1
feed,	1
nor	1
drink	1
water:	1
3:8	1
But	1
let	1
man	1
and	1
beast	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
sackcloth,	1
and	1
cry	1
mightily	1
unto	1
God:	1
yea,	1
let	1
them	1
turn	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
evil	1
way,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
violence	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
3:9	1
Who	1
can	1
tell	1
if	1
God	1
will	1
turn	1
and	1
repent,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
fierce	1
anger,	1
that	1
we	1
perish	1
not?	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
God	1
saw	1
their	1
works,	1
that	1
they	1
turned	1
from	1
their	1
evil	1
way;	1
and	1
God	1
repented	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
it	1
displeased	1
Jonah	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
angry.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
prayed	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
my	1
saying,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
country?	1
Therefore	1
I	1
fled	1
before	1
unto	1
Tarshish:	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gracious	1
God,	1
and	1
merciful,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
of	1
great	1
kindness,	1
and	1
repentest	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
4:3	1
Therefore	1
now,	1
O	1
LORD,	1
take,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
my	1
life	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:4	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry?	1
	1
4:5	1
So	1
Jonah	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
booth,	1
and	1
sat	1
under	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
shadow,	1
till	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
gourd,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
over	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
shadow	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
grief.	1
So	1
Jonah	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad	1
of	1
the	1
gourd.	1
	1
4:7	1
But	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
worm	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
rose	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
it	1
smote	1
the	1
gourd	1
that	1
it	1
withered.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
arise,	1
that	1
God	1
prepared	1
a	1
vehement	1
east	1
wind;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
beat	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Jonah,	1
that	1
he	1
fainted,	1
and	1
wished	1
in	1
himself	1
to	1
die,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
than	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
to	1
Jonah,	1
Doest	1
thou	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry	1
for	1
the	1
gourd?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
angry,	1
even	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
the	1
gourd,	1
for	1
the	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
laboured,	1
neither	1
madest	1
it	1
grow;	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
night,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
a	1
night:	1
4:11	1
And	1
should	1
not	1
I	1
spare	1
Nineveh,	1
that	1
great	1
city,	1
wherein	1
are	1
more	1
then	1
sixscore	1
thousand	1
persons	1
that	1
cannot	1
discern	1
between	1
their	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
their	1
left	1
hand;	1
and	1
also	1
much	1
cattle?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Micah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Micah	1
the	1
Morasthite	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Jotham,	1
Ahaz,	1
and	1
Hezekiah,	1
kings	1
of	1
Judah,	1
which	1
he	1
saw	1
concerning	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:2	1
Hear,	1
all	1
ye	1
people;	1
hearken,	1
O	1
earth,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
therein	1
is:	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD	1
be	1
witness	1
against	1
you,	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
his	1
holy	1
temple.	1
	1
1:3	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
tread	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:4	1
And	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
be	1
molten	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
valleys	1
shall	1
be	1
cleft,	1
as	1
wax	1
before	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
are	1
poured	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob	1
is	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
Samaria?	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
Judah?	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
1:6	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Samaria	1
as	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
as	1
plantings	1
of	1
a	1
vineyard:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
down	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof	1
into	1
the	1
valley,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
the	1
foundations	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
graven	1
images	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hires	1
thereof	1
shall	1
be	1
burned	1
with	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
idols	1
thereof	1
will	1
I	1
lay	1
desolate:	1
for	1
she	1
gathered	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
hire	1
of	1
an	1
harlot.	1
	1
1:8	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
wail	1
and	1
howl,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
stripped	1
and	1
naked:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
wailing	1
like	1
the	1
dragons,	1
and	1
mourning	1
as	1
the	1
owls.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
her	1
wound	1
is	1
incurable;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
Judah;	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
even	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:10	1
Declare	1
ye	1
it	1
not	1
at	1
Gath,	1
weep	1
ye	1
not	1
at	1
all:	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Aphrah	1
roll	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
dust.	1
	1
1:11	1
Pass	1
ye	1
away,	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Saphir,	1
having	1
thy	1
shame	1
naked:	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Zaanan	1
came	1
not	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Bethezel;	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
you	1
his	1
standing.	1
	1
1:12	1
For	1
the	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Maroth	1
waited	1
carefully	1
for	1
good:	1
but	1
evil	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:13	1
O	1
thou	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Lachish,	1
bind	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
the	1
swift	1
beast:	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
the	1
transgressions	1
of	1
Israel	1
were	1
found	1
in	1
thee.	1
	1
1:14	1
Therefore	1
shalt	1
thou	1
give	1
presents	1
to	1
Moreshethgath:	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Achzib	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:15	1
Yet	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
an	1
heir	1
unto	1
thee,	1
O	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Mareshah:	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
unto	1
Adullam	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Make	1
thee	1
bald,	1
and	1
poll	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
delicate	1
children;	1
enlarge	1
thy	1
baldness	1
as	1
the	1
eagle;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
gone	1
into	1
captivity	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
2:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
devise	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
work	1
evil	1
upon	1
their	1
beds!	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
is	1
light,	1
they	1
practise	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
their	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
they	1
covet	1
fields,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
by	1
violence;	1
and	1
houses,	1
and	1
take	1
them	1
away:	1
so	1
they	1
oppress	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
even	1
a	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
heritage.	1
	1
2:3	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Behold,	1
against	1
this	1
family	1
do	1
I	1
devise	1
an	1
evil,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
remove	1
your	1
necks;	1
neither	1
shall	1
ye	1
go	1
haughtily:	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
evil.	1
	1
2:4	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
one	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
lament	1
with	1
a	1
doleful	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
say,	1
We	1
be	1
utterly	1
spoiled:	1
he	1
hath	1
changed	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
people:	1
how	1
hath	1
he	1
removed	1
it	1
from	1
me!	1
turning	1
away	1
he	1
hath	1
divided	1
our	1
fields.	1
	1
2:5	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
none	1
that	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
cord	1
by	1
lot	1
in	1
the	1
congregation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:6	1
Prophesy	1
ye	1
not,	1
say	1
they	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
prophesy:	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
prophesy	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
shame.	1
	1
2:7	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
named	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
straitened?	1
are	1
these	1
his	1
doings?	1
do	1
not	1
my	1
words	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
walketh	1
uprightly?	1
	1
2:8	1
Even	1
of	1
late	1
my	1
people	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
enemy:	1
ye	1
pull	1
off	1
the	1
robe	1
with	1
the	1
garment	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
pass	1
by	1
securely	1
as	1
men	1
averse	1
from	1
war.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
women	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
have	1
ye	1
cast	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
pleasant	1
houses;	1
from	1
their	1
children	1
have	1
ye	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
2:10	1
Arise	1
ye,	1
and	1
depart;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
rest:	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
polluted,	1
it	1
shall	1
destroy	1
you,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
destruction.	1
	1
2:11	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
falsehood	1
do	1
lie,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
prophesy	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
of	1
strong	1
drink;	1
he	1
shall	1
even	1
be	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
2:12	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
assemble,	1
O	1
Jacob,	1
all	1
of	1
thee;	1
I	1
will	1
surely	1
gather	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel;	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
them	1
together	1
as	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
Bozrah,	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
their	1
fold:	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
great	1
noise	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
2:13	1
The	1
breaker	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
them:	1
they	1
have	1
broken	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
are	1
gone	1
out	1
by	1
it:	1
and	1
their	1
king	1
shall	1
pass	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Hear,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
O	1
heads	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
ye	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:2	1
Who	1
hate	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
evil;	1
who	1
pluck	1
off	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
from	1
off	1
their	1
bones;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
also	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
flay	1
their	1
skin	1
from	1
off	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
break	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
chop	1
them	1
in	1
pieces,	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
pot,	1
and	1
as	1
flesh	1
within	1
the	1
caldron.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
cry	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
them:	1
he	1
will	1
even	1
hide	1
his	1
face	1
from	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
behaved	1
themselves	1
ill	1
in	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:5	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
concerning	1
the	1
prophets	1
that	1
make	1
my	1
people	1
err,	1
that	1
bite	1
with	1
their	1
teeth,	1
and	1
cry,	1
Peace;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
putteth	1
not	1
into	1
their	1
mouths,	1
they	1
even	1
prepare	1
war	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
3:6	1
Therefore	1
night	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
vision;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
divine;	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
go	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
dark	1
over	1
them.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
seers	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
confounded:	1
yea,	1
they	1
shall	1
all	1
cover	1
their	1
lips;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:8	1
But	1
truly	1
I	1
am	1
full	1
of	1
power	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
of	1
might,	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
Jacob	1
his	1
transgression,	1
and	1
to	1
Israel	1
his	1
sin.	1
	1
3:9	1
Hear	1
this,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
ye	1
heads	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
abhor	1
judgment,	1
and	1
pervert	1
all	1
equity.	1
	1
3:10	1
They	1
build	1
up	1
Zion	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
iniquity.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
heads	1
thereof	1
judge	1
for	1
reward,	1
and	1
the	1
priests	1
thereof	1
teach	1
for	1
hire,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
thereof	1
divine	1
for	1
money:	1
yet	1
will	1
they	1
lean	1
upon	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
say,	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
LORD	1
among	1
us?	1
none	1
evil	1
can	1
come	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
3:12	1
Therefore	1
shall	1
Zion	1
for	1
your	1
sake	1
be	1
plowed	1
as	1
a	1
field,	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
become	1
heaps,	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
the	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
	1
4:1	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
above	1
the	1
hills;	1
and	1
people	1
shall	1
flow	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
say,	1
Come,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
his	1
paths:	1
for	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
of	1
Zion,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
among	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
rebuke	1
strong	1
nations	1
afar	1
off;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
beat	1
their	1
swords	1
into	1
plowshares,	1
and	1
their	1
spears	1
into	1
pruninghooks:	1
nation	1
shall	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
a	1
sword	1
against	1
nation,	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
learn	1
war	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
they	1
shall	1
sit	1
every	1
man	1
under	1
his	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
fig	1
tree;	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid:	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
spoken	1
it.	1
	1
4:5	1
For	1
all	1
people	1
will	1
walk	1
every	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
god,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
for	1
ever	1
and	1
ever.	1
	1
4:6	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
I	1
assemble	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
driven	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted;	1
4:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
her	1
that	1
halted	1
a	1
remnant,	1
and	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
far	1
off	1
a	1
strong	1
nation:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
mount	1
Zion	1
from	1
henceforth,	1
even	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
tower	1
of	1
the	1
flock,	1
the	1
strong	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
unto	1
thee	1
shall	1
it	1
come,	1
even	1
the	1
first	1
dominion;	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:9	1
Now	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
cry	1
out	1
aloud?	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
king	1
in	1
thee?	1
is	1
thy	1
counsellor	1
perished?	1
for	1
pangs	1
have	1
taken	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail.	1
	1
4:10	1
Be	1
in	1
pain,	1
and	1
labour	1
to	1
bring	1
forth,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion,	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
travail:	1
for	1
now	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
even	1
to	1
Babylon;	1
there	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
delivered;	1
there	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
redeem	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
thine	1
enemies.	1
	1
4:11	1
Now	1
also	1
many	1
nations	1
are	1
gathered	1
against	1
thee,	1
that	1
say,	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
defiled,	1
and	1
let	1
our	1
eye	1
look	1
upon	1
Zion.	1
	1
4:12	1
But	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
neither	1
understand	1
they	1
his	1
counsel:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
gather	1
them	1
as	1
the	1
sheaves	1
into	1
the	1
floor.	1
	1
4:13	1
Arise	1
and	1
thresh,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thine	1
horn	1
iron,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
hoofs	1
brass:	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
beat	1
in	1
pieces	1
many	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consecrate	1
their	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
their	1
substance	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Now	1
gather	1
thyself	1
in	1
troops,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
troops:	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
siege	1
against	1
us:	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
judge	1
of	1
Israel	1
with	1
a	1
rod	1
upon	1
the	1
cheek.	1
	1
5:2	1
But	1
thou,	1
Bethlehem	1
Ephratah,	1
though	1
thou	1
be	1
little	1
among	1
the	1
thousands	1
of	1
Judah,	1
yet	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
he	1
come	1
forth	1
unto	1
me	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
ruler	1
in	1
Israel;	1
whose	1
goings	1
forth	1
have	1
been	1
from	1
of	1
old,	1
from	1
everlasting.	1
	1
5:3	1
Therefore	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
them	1
up,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
which	1
travaileth	1
hath	1
brought	1
forth:	1
then	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
brethren	1
shall	1
return	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
5:4	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
stand	1
and	1
feed	1
in	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
in	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
his	1
God;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
abide:	1
for	1
now	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
great	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
this	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
peace,	1
when	1
the	1
Assyrian	1
shall	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
land:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
tread	1
in	1
our	1
palaces,	1
then	1
shall	1
we	1
raise	1
against	1
him	1
seven	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
eight	1
principal	1
men.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
waste	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Assyria	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nimrod	1
in	1
the	1
entrances	1
thereof:	1
thus	1
shall	1
he	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
Assyrian,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
into	1
our	1
land,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
treadeth	1
within	1
our	1
borders.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
dew	1
from	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
showers	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
that	1
tarrieth	1
not	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Jacob	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
many	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
lion	1
among	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep:	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
go	1
through,	1
both	1
treadeth	1
down,	1
and	1
teareth	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
none	1
can	1
deliver.	1
	1
5:9	1
Thine	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
upon	1
thine	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
all	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
horses	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
thy	1
chariots:	1
5:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
thy	1
land,	1
and	1
throw	1
down	1
all	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
5:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
witchcrafts	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
hand;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
soothsayers:	1
5:13	1
Thy	1
graven	1
images	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off,	1
and	1
thy	1
standing	1
images	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
worship	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
thine	1
hands.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pluck	1
up	1
thy	1
groves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
destroy	1
thy	1
cities.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
execute	1
vengeance	1
in	1
anger	1
and	1
fury	1
upon	1
the	1
heathen,	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard.	1
	1
6:1	1
Hear	1
ye	1
now	1
what	1
the	1
LORD	1
saith;	1
Arise,	1
contend	1
thou	1
before	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
hills	1
hear	1
thy	1
voice.	1
	1
6:2	1
Hear	1
ye,	1
O	1
mountains,	1
the	1
LORD's	1
controversy,	1
and	1
ye	1
strong	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
a	1
controversy	1
with	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
Israel.	1
	1
6:3	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
unto	1
thee?	1
and	1
wherein	1
have	1
I	1
wearied	1
thee?	1
testify	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
6:4	1
For	1
I	1
brought	1
thee	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
redeemed	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
servants;	1
and	1
I	1
sent	1
before	1
thee	1
Moses,	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
Miriam.	1
	1
6:5	1
O	1
my	1
people,	1
remember	1
now	1
what	1
Balak	1
king	1
of	1
Moab	1
consulted,	1
and	1
what	1
Balaam	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Beor	1
answered	1
him	1
from	1
Shittim	1
unto	1
Gilgal;	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:6	1
Wherewith	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
bow	1
myself	1
before	1
the	1
high	1
God?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
burnt	1
offerings,	1
with	1
calves	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
old?	1
	1
6:7	1
Will	1
the	1
LORD	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thousands	1
of	1
rams,	1
or	1
with	1
ten	1
thousands	1
of	1
rivers	1
of	1
oil?	1
shall	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
firstborn	1
for	1
my	1
transgression,	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
my	1
soul?	1
	1
6:8	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
thee,	1
O	1
man,	1
what	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
what	1
doth	1
the	1
LORD	1
require	1
of	1
thee,	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
justly,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
mercy,	1
and	1
to	1
walk	1
humbly	1
with	1
thy	1
God?	1
	1
6:9	1
The	1
LORD's	1
voice	1
crieth	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
wisdom	1
shall	1
see	1
thy	1
name:	1
hear	1
ye	1
the	1
rod,	1
and	1
who	1
hath	1
appointed	1
it.	1
	1
6:10	1
Are	1
there	1
yet	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
wickedness	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
and	1
the	1
scant	1
measure	1
that	1
is	1
abominable?	1
	1
6:11	1
Shall	1
I	1
count	1
them	1
pure	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
balances,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
bag	1
of	1
deceitful	1
weights?	1
	1
6:12	1
For	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
thereof	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
have	1
spoken	1
lies,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
is	1
deceitful	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
sick	1
in	1
smiting	1
thee,	1
in	1
making	1
thee	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
sins.	1
	1
6:14	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
eat,	1
but	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
thy	1
casting	1
down	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
take	1
hold,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
deliver;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
deliverest	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
6:15	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
sow,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
reap;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
tread	1
the	1
olives,	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
anoint	1
thee	1
with	1
oil;	1
and	1
sweet	1
wine,	1
but	1
shalt	1
not	1
drink	1
wine.	1
	1
6:16	1
For	1
the	1
statutes	1
of	1
Omri	1
are	1
kept,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Ahab,	1
and	1
ye	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
counsels;	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
thereof	1
an	1
hissing:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
my	1
people.	1
	1
7:1	1
Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
the	1
summer	1
fruits,	1
as	1
the	1
grapegleanings	1
of	1
the	1
vintage:	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
cluster	1
to	1
eat:	1
my	1
soul	1
desired	1
the	1
firstripe	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:2	1
The	1
good	1
man	1
is	1
perished	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
upright	1
among	1
men:	1
they	1
all	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
blood;	1
they	1
hunt	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
brother	1
with	1
a	1
net.	1
	1
7:3	1
That	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
evil	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
earnestly,	1
the	1
prince	1
asketh,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
asketh	1
for	1
a	1
reward;	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
man,	1
he	1
uttereth	1
his	1
mischievous	1
desire:	1
so	1
they	1
wrap	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
brier:	1
the	1
most	1
upright	1
is	1
sharper	1
than	1
a	1
thorn	1
hedge:	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
thy	1
watchmen	1
and	1
thy	1
visitation	1
cometh;	1
now	1
shall	1
be	1
their	1
perplexity.	1
	1
7:5	1
Trust	1
ye	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
friend,	1
put	1
ye	1
not	1
confidence	1
in	1
a	1
guide:	1
keep	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
thy	1
mouth	1
from	1
her	1
that	1
lieth	1
in	1
thy	1
bosom.	1
	1
7:6	1
For	1
the	1
son	1
dishonoureth	1
the	1
father,	1
the	1
daughter	1
riseth	1
up	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law;	1
a	1
man's	1
enemies	1
are	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
7:7	1
Therefore	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
will	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation:	1
my	1
God	1
will	1
hear	1
me.	1
	1
7:8	1
Rejoice	1
not	1
against	1
me,	1
O	1
mine	1
enemy:	1
when	1
I	1
fall,	1
I	1
shall	1
arise;	1
when	1
I	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness,	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
7:9	1
I	1
will	1
bear	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
him,	1
until	1
he	1
plead	1
my	1
cause,	1
and	1
execute	1
judgment	1
for	1
me:	1
he	1
will	1
bring	1
me	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
behold	1
his	1
righteousness.	1
	1
7:10	1
Then	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
mine	1
enemy	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
shame	1
shall	1
cover	1
her	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God?	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
behold	1
her:	1
now	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
7:11	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
thy	1
walls	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
built,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
decree	1
be	1
far	1
removed.	1
	1
7:12	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
also	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
even	1
to	1
thee	1
from	1
Assyria,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortified	1
cities,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fortress	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
from	1
sea	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
mountain	1
to	1
mountain.	1
	1
7:13	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
desolate	1
because	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein,	1
for	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
7:14	1
Feed	1
thy	1
people	1
with	1
thy	1
rod,	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
thine	1
heritage,	1
which	1
dwell	1
solitarily	1
in	1
the	1
wood,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Carmel:	1
let	1
them	1
feed	1
in	1
Bashan	1
and	1
Gilead,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
7:15	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
thy	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
will	1
I	1
shew	1
unto	1
him	1
marvellous	1
things.	1
	1
7:16	1
The	1
nations	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
be	1
confounded	1
at	1
all	1
their	1
might:	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hand	1
upon	1
their	1
mouth,	1
their	1
ears	1
shall	1
be	1
deaf.	1
	1
7:17	1
They	1
shall	1
lick	1
the	1
dust	1
like	1
a	1
serpent,	1
they	1
shall	1
move	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
holes	1
like	1
worms	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
shall	1
fear	1
because	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
7:18	1
Who	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
like	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
pardoneth	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
passeth	1
by	1
the	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
his	1
heritage?	1
he	1
retaineth	1
not	1
his	1
anger	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
mercy.	1
	1
7:19	1
He	1
will	1
turn	1
again,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
upon	1
us;	1
he	1
will	1
subdue	1
our	1
iniquities;	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
cast	1
all	1
their	1
sins	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
7:20	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
perform	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
the	1
mercy	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sworn	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Nahum	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
Nineveh.	1
The	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
Nahum	1
the	1
Elkoshite.	1
	1
1:2	1
God	1
is	1
jealous,	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth;	1
the	1
LORD	1
revengeth,	1
and	1
is	1
furious;	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
his	1
adversaries,	1
and	1
he	1
reserveth	1
wrath	1
for	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
great	1
in	1
power,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
acquit	1
the	1
wicked:	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
whirlwind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
storm,	1
and	1
the	1
clouds	1
are	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
1:4	1
He	1
rebuketh	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
maketh	1
it	1
dry,	1
and	1
drieth	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
rivers:	1
Bashan	1
languisheth,	1
and	1
Carmel,	1
and	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
languisheth.	1
	1
1:5	1
The	1
mountains	1
quake	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
hills	1
melt,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
burned	1
at	1
his	1
presence,	1
yea,	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
1:6	1
Who	1
can	1
stand	1
before	1
his	1
indignation?	1
and	1
who	1
can	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
fierceness	1
of	1
his	1
anger?	1
his	1
fury	1
is	1
poured	1
out	1
like	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
are	1
thrown	1
down	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
good,	1
a	1
strong	1
hold	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble;	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
with	1
an	1
overrunning	1
flood	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
thereof,	1
and	1
darkness	1
shall	1
pursue	1
his	1
enemies.	1
	1
1:9	1
What	1
do	1
ye	1
imagine	1
against	1
the	1
LORD?	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
utter	1
end:	1
affliction	1
shall	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
the	1
second	1
time.	1
	1
1:10	1
For	1
while	1
they	1
be	1
folden	1
together	1
as	1
thorns,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
drunken	1
as	1
drunkards,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
as	1
stubble	1
fully	1
dry.	1
	1
1:11	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
imagineth	1
evil	1
against	1
the	1
LORD,	1
a	1
wicked	1
counsellor.	1
	1
1:12	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
Though	1
they	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
likewise	1
many,	1
yet	1
thus	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
cut	1
down,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through.	1
Though	1
I	1
have	1
afflicted	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
afflict	1
thee	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
1:13	1
For	1
now	1
will	1
I	1
break	1
his	1
yoke	1
from	1
off	1
thee,	1
and	1
will	1
burst	1
thy	1
bonds	1
in	1
sunder.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
given	1
a	1
commandment	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
that	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
sown:	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
thy	1
gods	1
will	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
and	1
the	1
molten	1
image:	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thy	1
grave;	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
vile.	1
	1
1:15	1
Behold	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
bringeth	1
good	1
tidings,	1
that	1
publisheth	1
peace!	1
O	1
Judah,	1
keep	1
thy	1
solemn	1
feasts,	1
perform	1
thy	1
vows:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
pass	1
through	1
thee;	1
he	1
is	1
utterly	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
2:1	1
He	1
that	1
dasheth	1
in	1
pieces	1
is	1
come	1
up	1
before	1
thy	1
face:	1
keep	1
the	1
munition,	1
watch	1
the	1
way,	1
make	1
thy	1
loins	1
strong,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
power	1
mightily.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
turned	1
away	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
as	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
the	1
emptiers	1
have	1
emptied	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
marred	1
their	1
vine	1
branches.	1
	1
2:3	1
The	1
shield	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
men	1
is	1
made	1
red,	1
the	1
valiant	1
men	1
are	1
in	1
scarlet:	1
the	1
chariots	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
flaming	1
torches	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
fir	1
trees	1
shall	1
be	1
terribly	1
shaken.	1
	1
2:4	1
The	1
chariots	1
shall	1
rage	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
they	1
shall	1
justle	1
one	1
against	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
ways:	1
they	1
shall	1
seem	1
like	1
torches,	1
they	1
shall	1
run	1
like	1
the	1
lightnings.	1
	1
2:5	1
He	1
shall	1
recount	1
his	1
worthies:	1
they	1
shall	1
stumble	1
in	1
their	1
walk;	1
they	1
shall	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
thereof,	1
and	1
the	1
defence	1
shall	1
be	1
prepared.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
shall	1
be	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
palace	1
shall	1
be	1
dissolved.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
Huzzab	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
her	1
maids	1
shall	1
lead	1
her	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
doves,	1
tabering	1
upon	1
their	1
breasts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
of	1
old	1
like	1
a	1
pool	1
of	1
water:	1
yet	1
they	1
shall	1
flee	1
away.	1
	1
Stand,	1
stand,	1
shall	1
they	1
cry;	1
but	1
none	1
shall	1
look	1
back.	1
	1
2:9	1
Take	1
ye	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
silver,	1
take	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
gold:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
store	1
and	1
glory	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pleasant	1
furniture.	1
	1
2:10	1
She	1
is	1
empty,	1
and	1
void,	1
and	1
waste:	1
and	1
the	1
heart	1
melteth,	1
and	1
the	1
knees	1
smite	1
together,	1
and	1
much	1
pain	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
loins,	1
and	1
the	1

2:11	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
dwelling	1
of	1
the	1
lions,	1
and	1
the	1
feedingplace	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lions,	1
where	1
the	1
lion,	1
even	1
the	1
old	1
lion,	1
walked,	1
and	1
the	1
lion's	1
whelp,	1
and	1
none	1
made	1
them	1
afraid?	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
lion	1
did	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
enough	1
for	1
his	1
whelps,	1
and	1
strangled	1
for	1
his	1
lionesses,	1
and	1
filled	1
his	1
holes	1
with	1
prey,	1
and	1
his	1
dens	1
with	1
ravin.	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
burn	1
her	1
chariots	1
in	1
the	1
smoke,	1
and	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
young	1
lions:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
thy	1
prey	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
messengers	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
heard.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
bloody	1
city!	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
lies	1
and	1
robbery;	1
the	1
prey	1
departeth	1
not;	1
3:2	1
The	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
whip,	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
rattling	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
pransing	1
horses,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
jumping	1
chariots.	1
	1
3:3	1
The	1
horseman	1
lifteth	1
up	1
both	1
the	1
bright	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
glittering	1
spear:	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
slain,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
carcases;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
corpses;	1
they	1
stumble	1
upon	1
their	1
corpses:	1
3:4	1
Because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
whoredoms	1
of	1
the	1
wellfavoured	1
harlot,	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
witchcrafts,	1
that	1
selleth	1
nations	1
through	1
her	1
whoredoms,	1
and	1

through	1
her	1
witchcrafts.	1
	1
3:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
against	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
discover	1
thy	1
skirts	1
upon	1
thy	1
face,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
the	1
nations	1
thy	1
nakedness,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
thy	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cast	1
abominable	1
filth	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
vile,	1
and	1
will	1
set	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
gazingstock.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
look	1
upon	1
thee	1
shall	1
flee	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
say,	1
Nineveh	1
is	1
laid	1
waste:	1
who	1
will	1
bemoan	1
her?	1
whence	1
shall	1
I	1
seek	1
comforters	1
for	1
thee?	1
	1
3:8	1
Art	1
thou	1
better	1
than	1
populous	1
No,	1
that	1
was	1
situate	1
among	1
the	1
rivers,	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
waters	1
round	1
about	1
it,	1
whose	1
rampart	1
was	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
her	1
wall	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
sea?	1
	1
3:9	1
Ethiopia	1
and	1
Egypt	1
were	1
her	1
strength,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
infinite;	1
Put	1
and	1
Lubim	1
were	1
thy	1
helpers.	1
	1
3:10	1
Yet	1
was	1
she	1
carried	1
away,	1
she	1
went	1
into	1
captivity:	1
her	1
young	1
children	1
also	1
were	1
dashed	1
in	1
pieces	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
streets:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
her	1
honourable	1
men,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
great	1
men	1
were	1
bound	1
in	1
chains.	1
	1
3:11	1
Thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
drunken:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
hid,	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
seek	1
strength	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
enemy.	1
	1
3:12	1
All	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
fig	1
trees	1
with	1
the	1
firstripe	1
figs:	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
shaken,	1
they	1
shall	1
even	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
eater.	1
	1
3:13	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
are	1
women:	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
thy	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
set	1
wide	1
open	1
unto	1
thine	1
enemies:	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
devour	1
thy	1
bars.	1
	1
3:14	1
Draw	1
thee	1
waters	1
for	1
the	1
siege,	1
fortify	1
thy	1
strong	1
holds:	1
go	1
into	1
clay,	1
and	1
tread	1
the	1
morter,	1
make	1
strong	1
the	1
brickkiln.	1
	1
3:15	1
There	1
shall	1
the	1
fire	1
devour	1
thee;	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
cut	1
thee	1
off,	1
it	1
shall	1
eat	1
thee	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
cankerworm:	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
cankerworm,	1
make	1
thyself	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
locusts.	1
	1
3:16	1
Thou	1
hast	1
multiplied	1
thy	1
merchants	1
above	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven:	1
the	1
cankerworm	1
spoileth,	1
and	1
fleeth	1
away.	1
	1
3:17	1
Thy	1
crowned	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
locusts,	1
and	1
thy	1
captains	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
grasshoppers,	1
which	1
camp	1
in	1
the	1
hedges	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
day,	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
ariseth	1
they	1
flee	1
away,	1
and	1
their	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
known	1
where	1
they	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Thy	1
shepherds	1
slumber,	1
O	1
king	1
of	1
Assyria:	1
thy	1
nobles	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
dust:	1
thy	1
people	1
is	1
scattered	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gathereth	1
them.	1
	1
3:19	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
healing	1
of	1
thy	1
bruise;	1
thy	1
wound	1
is	1
grievous:	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
bruit	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
clap	1
the	1
hands	1
over	1
thee:	1
for	1
upon	1
whom	1
hath	1
not	1
thy	1
wickedness	1
passed	1
continually?	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Habakkuk	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
which	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
did	1
see.	1
	1
1:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
cry,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
hear!	1
even	1
cry	1
out	1
unto	1
thee	1
of	1
violence,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
save!	1
	1
1:3	1
Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
shew	1
me	1
iniquity,	1
and	1
cause	1
me	1
to	1
behold	1
grievance?	1
for	1
spoiling	1
and	1
violence	1
are	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
that	1
raise	1
up	1
strife	1
and	1
contention.	1
	1
1:4	1
Therefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
slacked,	1
and	1
judgment	1
doth	1
never	1
go	1
forth:	1
for	1
the	1
wicked	1
doth	1
compass	1
about	1
the	1
righteous;	1
therefore	1
wrong	1
judgment	1
proceedeth.	1
	1
1:5	1
Behold	1
ye	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
and	1
regard,	1
and	1
wonder	1
marvelously:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days	1
which	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
1:6	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
that	1
bitter	1
and	1
hasty	1
nation,	1
which	1
shall	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
dwellingplaces	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
their's.	1
	1
1:7	1
They	1
are	1
terrible	1
and	1
dreadful:	1
their	1
judgment	1
and	1
their	1
dignity	1
shall	1
proceed	1
of	1
themselves.	1
	1
1:8	1
Their	1
horses	1
also	1
are	1
swifter	1
than	1
the	1
leopards,	1
and	1
are	1
more	1
fierce	1
than	1
the	1
evening	1
wolves:	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
spread	1
themselves,	1
and	1
their	1
horsemen	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
far;	1
they	1
shall	1
fly	1
as	1
the	1
eagle	1
that	1
hasteth	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
1:9	1
They	1
shall	1
come	1
all	1
for	1
violence:	1
their	1
faces	1
shall	1
sup	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
east	1
wind,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
the	1
captivity	1
as	1
the	1
sand.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scoff	1
at	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
scorn	1
unto	1
them:	1
they	1
shall	1
deride	1
every	1
strong	1
hold;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
heap	1
dust,	1
and	1
take	1
it.	1
	1
1:11	1
Then	1
shall	1
his	1
mind	1
change,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
over,	1
and	1
offend,	1
imputing	1
this	1
his	1
power	1
unto	1
his	1
god.	1
	1
1:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
not	1
from	1
everlasting,	1
O	1
LORD	1
my	1
God,	1
mine	1
Holy	1
One?	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
die.	1
O	1
LORD,	1
thou	1
hast	1
ordained	1
them	1
for	1
judgment;	1
and,	1
O	1
mighty	1
God,	1
thou	1
hast	1
established	1
them	1
for	1
correction.	1
	1
1:13	1
Thou	1
art	1
of	1
purer	1
eyes	1
than	1
to	1
behold	1
evil,	1
and	1
canst	1
not	1
look	1
on	1
iniquity:	1
wherefore	1
lookest	1
thou	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
deal	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
holdest	1
thy	1
tongue	1
when	1
the	1
wicked	1
devoureth	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
righteous	1
than	1
he?	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
makest	1
men	1
as	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
as	1
the	1
creeping	1
things,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
ruler	1
over	1
them?	1
	1
1:15	1
They	1
take	1
up	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
angle,	1
they	1
catch	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
drag:	1
therefore	1
they	1
rejoice	1
and	1
are	1
glad.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
burn	1
incense	1
unto	1
their	1
drag;	1
because	1
by	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
is	1
fat,	1
and	1
their	1
meat	1
plenteous.	1
	1
1:17	1
Shall	1
they	1
therefore	1
empty	1
their	1
net,	1
and	1
not	1
spare	1
continually	1
to	1
slay	1
the	1
nations?	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
will	1
stand	1
upon	1
my	1
watch,	1
and	1
set	1
me	1
upon	1
the	1
tower,	1
and	1
will	1
watch	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
reproved.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
me,	1
and	1
said,	1
Write	1
the	1
vision,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
plain	1
upon	1
tables,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
run	1
that	1
readeth	1
it.	1
	1
2:3	1
For	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
yet	1
for	1
an	1
appointed	1
time,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
shall	1
speak,	1
and	1
not	1
lie:	1
though	1
it	1
tarry,	1
wait	1
for	1
it;	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
surely	1
come,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
tarry.	1
	1
2:4	1
Behold,	1
his	1
soul	1
which	1
is	1
lifted	1
up	1
is	1
not	1
upright	1
in	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
his	1
faith.	1
	1
2:5	1
Yea	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
transgresseth	1
by	1
wine,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
proud	1
man,	1
neither	1
keepeth	1
at	1
home,	1
who	1
enlargeth	1
his	1
desire	1
as	1
hell,	1
and	1
is	1
as	1
death,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
but	1
gathereth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
heapeth	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
people:	1
2:6	1
Shall	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
parable	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
taunting	1
proverb	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
say,	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
increaseth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
his!	1
how	1
long?	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
ladeth	1
himself	1
with	1
thick	1
clay!	1
	1
2:7	1
Shall	1
they	1
not	1
rise	1
up	1
suddenly	1
that	1
shall	1
bite	1
thee,	1
and	1
awake	1
that	1
shall	1
vex	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
for	1
booties	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
2:8	1
Because	1
thou	1
hast	1
spoiled	1
many	1
nations,	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
thee;	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:9	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
coveteth	1
an	1
evil	1
covetousness	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
set	1
his	1
nest	1
on	1
high,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
evil!	1
	1
2:10	1
Thou	1
hast	1
consulted	1
shame	1
to	1
thy	1
house	1
by	1
cutting	1
off	1
many	1
people,	1
and	1
hast	1
sinned	1
against	1
thy	1
soul.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
the	1
stone	1
shall	1
cry	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
timber	1
shall	1
answer	1
it.	1
	1
2:12	1
Woe	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
buildeth	1
a	1
town	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
stablisheth	1
a	1
city	1
by	1
iniquity!	1
	1
2:13	1
Behold,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
fire,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
weary	1
themselves	1
for	1
very	1
vanity?	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
the	1
waters	1
cover	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
2:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
giveth	1
his	1
neighbour	1
drink,	1
that	1
puttest	1
thy	1
bottle	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
makest	1
him	1
drunken	1
also,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
look	1
on	1
their	1
nakedness!	1
	1
2:16	1
Thou	1
art	1
filled	1
with	1
shame	1
for	1
glory:	1
drink	1
thou	1
also,	1
and	1
let	1
thy	1
foreskin	1
be	1
uncovered:	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
right	1
hand	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
shameful	1
spewing	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
2:17	1
For	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
Lebanon	1
shall	1
cover	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
spoil	1
of	1
beasts,	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
afraid,	1
because	1
of	1
men's	1
blood,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
dwell	1
therein.	1
	1
2:18	1
What	1
profiteth	1
the	1
graven	1
image	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
thereof	1
hath	1
graven	1
it;	1
the	1
molten	1
image,	1
and	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
lies,	1
that	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
trusteth	1
therein,	1
to	1
make	1
dumb	1
idols?	1
	1
2:19	1
Woe	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
wood,	1
Awake;	1
to	1
the	1
dumb	1
stone,	1
Arise,	1
it	1
shall	1
teach!	1
Behold,	1
it	1
is	1
laid	1
over	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
breath	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
holy	1
temple:	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
keep	1
silence	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:1	1
A	1
prayer	1
of	1
Habakkuk	1
the	1
prophet	1
upon	1
Shigionoth.	1
	1
3:2	1
O	1
LORD,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
speech,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid:	1
O	1
LORD,	1
revive	1
thy	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
years	1
make	1
known;	1
in	1
wrath	1
remember	1
mercy.	1
	1
3:3	1
God	1
came	1
from	1
Teman,	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
from	1
mount	1
Paran.	1
Selah.	1
His	1
glory	1
covered	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
his	1
praise.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
his	1
brightness	1
was	1
as	1
the	1
light;	1
he	1
had	1
horns	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
hiding	1
of	1
his	1
power.	1
	1
3:5	1
Before	1
him	1
went	1
the	1
pestilence,	1
and	1
burning	1
coals	1
went	1
forth	1
at	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
3:6	1
He	1
stood,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
beheld,	1
and	1
drove	1
asunder	1
the	1
nations;	1
and	1
the	1
everlasting	1
mountains	1
were	1
scattered,	1
the	1
perpetual	1
hills	1
did	1
bow:	1
his	1
ways	1
are	1
everlasting.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Cushan	1
in	1
affliction:	1
and	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Midian	1
did	1
tremble.	1
	1
3:8	1
Was	1
the	1
LORD	1
displeased	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thine	1
anger	1
against	1
the	1
rivers?	1
was	1
thy	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
sea,	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
ride	1
upon	1
thine	1
horses	1
and	1
thy	1
chariots	1
of	1
salvation?	1
	1
3:9	1
Thy	1
bow	1
was	1
made	1
quite	1
naked,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
oaths	1
of	1
the	1
tribes,	1
even	1
thy	1
word.	1
Selah.	1
Thou	1
didst	1
cleave	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
rivers.	1
	1
3:10	1
The	1
mountains	1
saw	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
trembled:	1
the	1
overflowing	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
passed	1
by:	1
the	1
deep	1
uttered	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
3:11	1
The	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
their	1
habitation:	1
at	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
thine	1
arrows	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shining	1
of	1
thy	1
glittering	1
spear.	1
	1
3:12	1
Thou	1
didst	1
march	1
through	1
the	1
land	1
in	1
indignation,	1
thou	1
didst	1
thresh	1
the	1
heathen	1
in	1
anger.	1
	1
3:13	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
forth	1
for	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
thy	1
people,	1
even	1
for	1
salvation	1
with	1
thine	1
anointed;	1
thou	1
woundedst	1
the	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
by	1
discovering	1
the	1
foundation	1
unto	1
the	1
neck.	1
Selah.	1
	1
3:14	1
Thou	1
didst	1
strike	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
staves	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
his	1
villages:	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
to	1
scatter	1
me:	1
their	1
rejoicing	1
was	1
as	1
to	1
devour	1
the	1
poor	1
secretly.	1
	1
3:15	1
Thou	1
didst	1
walk	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
thine	1
horses,	1
through	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
great	1
waters.	1
	1
3:16	1
When	1
I	1
heard,	1
my	1
belly	1
trembled;	1
my	1
lips	1
quivered	1
at	1
the	1
voice:	1
rottenness	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
bones,	1
and	1
I	1
trembled	1
in	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
trouble:	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
will	1
invade	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
troops.	1
	1
3:17	1
Although	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
shall	1
not	1
blossom,	1
neither	1
shall	1
fruit	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
vines;	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
shall	1
fail,	1
and	1
the	1
fields	1
shall	1
yield	1
no	1
meat;	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
fold,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
herd	1
in	1
the	1
stalls:	1
3:18	1
Yet	1
I	1
will	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
salvation.	1
	1
3:19	1
The	1
LORD	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
strength,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
my	1
feet	1
like	1
hinds'	1
feet,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
to	1
walk	1
upon	1
mine	1
high	1
places.	1
To	1
the	1
chief	1
singer	1
on	1
my	1
stringed	1
instruments.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Zephaniah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
came	1
unto	1
Zephaniah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cushi,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Gedaliah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Hizkiah,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Amon,	1
king	1
of	1
Judah.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
will	1
utterly	1
consume	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:3	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
man	1
and	1
beast;	1
I	1
will	1
consume	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
fishes	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
stumbling	1
blocks	1
with	1
the	1
wicked:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
man	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
stretch	1
out	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
Judah,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
Baal	1
from	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Chemarims	1
with	1
the	1
priests;	1
1:5	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops;	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
worship	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
swear	1
by	1
Malcham;	1
1:6	1
And	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
turned	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
sought	1
the	1
LORD,	1
nor	1
enquired	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
1:7	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace	1
at	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
GOD:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
prepared	1
a	1
sacrifice,	1
he	1
hath	1
bid	1
his	1
guests.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
sacrifice,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
punish	1
the	1
princes,	1
and	1
the	1
king's	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
strange	1
apparel.	1
	1
1:9	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
also	1
will	1
I	1
punish	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
leap	1
on	1
the	1
threshold,	1
which	1
fill	1
their	1
masters'	1
houses	1
with	1
violence	1
and	1
deceit.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
cry	1
from	1
the	1
fish	1
gate,	1
and	1
an	1
howling	1
from	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
crashing	1
from	1
the	1
hills.	1
	1
1:11	1
Howl,	1
ye	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Maktesh,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
merchant	1
people	1
are	1
cut	1
down;	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
bear	1
silver	1
are	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
at	1
that	1
time,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
search	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
candles,	1
and	1
punish	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
are	1
settled	1
on	1
their	1
lees:	1
that	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
good,	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
evil.	1
	1
1:13	1
Therefore	1
their	1
goods	1
shall	1
become	1
a	1
booty,	1
and	1
their	1
houses	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
also	1
build	1
houses,	1
but	1
not	1
inhabit	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
plant	1
vineyards,	1
but	1
not	1
drink	1
the	1
wine	1
thereof.	1
	1
1:14	1
The	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
near,	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
and	1
hasteth	1
greatly,	1
even	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
the	1
mighty	1
man	1
shall	1
cry	1
there	1
bitterly.	1
	1
1:15	1
That	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wrath,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
distress,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
wasteness	1
and	1
desolation,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
darkness	1
and	1
gloominess,	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
clouds	1
and	1
thick	1
darkness,	1
1:16	1
A	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet	1
and	1
alarm	1
against	1
the	1
fenced	1
cities,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
high	1
towers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
distress	1
upon	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
like	1
blind	1
men,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
their	1
blood	1
shall	1
be	1
poured	1
out	1
as	1
dust,	1
and	1
their	1
flesh	1
as	1
the	1
dung.	1
	1
1:18	1
Neither	1
their	1
silver	1
nor	1
their	1
gold	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
deliver	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
wrath;	1
but	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
his	1
jealousy:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
even	1
a	1
speedy	1
riddance	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
2:1	1
Gather	1
yourselves	1
together,	1
yea,	1
gather	1
together,	1
O	1
nation	1
not	1
desired;	1
2:2	1
Before	1
the	1
decree	1
bring	1
forth,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
pass	1
as	1
the	1
chaff,	1
before	1
the	1
fierce	1
anger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
2:3	1
Seek	1
ye	1
the	1
LORD,	1
all	1
ye	1
meek	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
his	1
judgment;	1
seek	1
righteousness,	1
seek	1
meekness:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hid	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
anger.	1
	1
2:4	1
For	1
Gaza	1
shall	1
be	1
forsaken,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
a	1
desolation:	1
they	1
shall	1
drive	1
out	1
Ashdod	1
at	1
the	1
noon	1
day,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
2:5	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Cherethites!	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
against	1
you;	1
O	1
Canaan,	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
destroy	1
thee,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
dwellings	1
and	1
cottages	1
for	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
folds	1
for	1
flocks.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
the	1
coast	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah;	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
thereupon:	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
they	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
evening:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
visit	1
them,	1
and	1
turn	1
away	1
their	1
captivity.	1
	1
2:8	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
Moab,	1
and	1
the	1
revilings	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon,	1
whereby	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
their	1
border.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
Surely	1
Moab	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
Sodom,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Ammon	1
as	1
Gomorrah,	1
even	1
the	1
breeding	1
of	1
nettles,	1
and	1
saltpits,	1
and	1
a	1
perpetual	1
desolation:	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
spoil	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
shall	1
possess	1
them.	1
	1
2:10	1
This	1
shall	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
pride,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
reproached	1
and	1
magnified	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:11	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
terrible	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
famish	1
all	1
the	1
gods	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
men	1
shall	1
worship	1
him,	1
every	1
one	1
from	1
his	1
place,	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:12	1
Ye	1
Ethiopians	1
also,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
slain	1
by	1
my	1
sword.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
stretch	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
against	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
Nineveh	1
a	1
desolation,	1
and	1
dry	1
like	1
a	1
wilderness.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
flocks	1
shall	1
lie	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her,	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
nations:	1
both	1
the	1
cormorant	1
and	1
the	1
bittern	1
shall	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
lintels	1
of	1
it;	1
their	1
voice	1
shall	1
sing	1
in	1
the	1
windows;	1
desolation	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
thresholds;	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
uncover	1
the	1
cedar	1
work.	1
	1
2:15	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
rejoicing	1
city	1
that	1
dwelt	1
carelessly,	1
that	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
heart,	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
beside	1
me:	1
how	1
is	1
she	1
become	1
a	1
desolation,	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
beasts	1
to	1
lie	1
down	1
in!	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
passeth	1
by	1
her	1
shall	1
hiss,	1
and	1
wag	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:1	1
Woe	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
filthy	1
and	1
polluted,	1
to	1
the	1
oppressing	1
city!	1
3:2	1
She	1
obeyed	1
not	1
the	1
voice;	1
she	1
received	1
not	1
correction;	1
she	1
trusted	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
she	1
drew	1
not	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
Her	1
princes	1
within	1
her	1
are	1
roaring	1
lions;	1
her	1
judges	1
are	1
evening	1
wolves;	1
they	1
gnaw	1
not	1
the	1
bones	1
till	1
the	1
morrow.	1
	1
3:4	1
Her	1
prophets	1
are	1
light	1
and	1
treacherous	1
persons:	1
her	1
priests	1
have	1
polluted	1
the	1
sanctuary,	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
violence	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:5	1
The	1
just	1
LORD	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof;	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity:	1
every	1
morning	1
doth	1
he	1
bring	1
his	1
judgment	1
to	1
light,	1
he	1
faileth	1
not;	1
but	1
the	1
unjust	1
knoweth	1
no	1
shame.	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
nations:	1
their	1
towers	1
are	1
desolate;	1
I	1
made	1
their	1
streets	1
waste,	1
that	1
none	1
passeth	1
by:	1
their	1
cities	1
are	1
destroyed,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
inhabitant.	1
	1
3:7	1
I	1
said,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fear	1
me,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
receive	1
instruction;	1
so	1
their	1
dwelling	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
howsoever	1
I	1
punished	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
rose	1
early,	1
and	1
corrupted	1
all	1
their	1
doings.	1
	1
3:8	1
Therefore	1
wait	1
ye	1
upon	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
rise	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
prey:	1
for	1
my	1
determination	1
is	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
nations,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
assemble	1
the	1
kingdoms,	1
to	1
pour	1
upon	1
them	1
mine	1
indignation,	1
even	1
all	1
my	1
fierce	1
anger:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
jealousy.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
pure	1
language,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
all	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
consent.	1
	1
3:10	1
From	1
beyond	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
Ethiopia	1
my	1
suppliants,	1
even	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
dispersed,	1
shall	1
bring	1
mine	1
offering.	1
	1
3:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed	1
for	1
all	1
thy	1
doings,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
transgressed	1
against	1
me:	1
for	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
them	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
thy	1
pride,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
haughty	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
3:12	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
leave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
an	1
afflicted	1
and	1
poor	1
people,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
3:13	1
The	1
remnant	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
iniquity,	1
nor	1
speak	1
lies;	1
neither	1
shall	1
a	1
deceitful	1
tongue	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
their	1
mouth:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
feed	1
and	1
lie	1
down,	1
and	1
none	1
shall	1
make	1
them	1
afraid.	1
	1
3:14	1
Sing,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
3:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
taken	1
away	1
thy	1
judgments,	1
he	1
hath	1
cast	1
out	1
thine	1
enemy:	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Israel,	1
even	1
the	1
LORD,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
see	1
evil	1
any	1
more.	1
	1
3:16	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
Fear	1
thou	1
not:	1
and	1
to	1
Zion,	1
Let	1
not	1
thine	1
hands	1
be	1
slack.	1
	1
3:17	1
The	1
LORD	1
thy	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee	1
is	1
mighty;	1
he	1
will	1
save,	1
he	1
will	1
rejoice	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
joy;	1
he	1
will	1
rest	1
in	1
his	1
love,	1
he	1
will	1
joy	1
over	1
thee	1
with	1
singing.	1
	1
3:18	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sorrowful	1
for	1
the	1
solemn	1
assembly,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
thee,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
burden.	1
	1
3:19	1
Behold,	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
undo	1
all	1
that	1
afflict	1
thee:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
her	1
that	1
halteth,	1
and	1
gather	1
her	1
that	1
was	1
driven	1
out;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
get	1
them	1
praise	1
and	1
fame	1
in	1
every	1
land	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
to	1
shame.	1
	1
3:20	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
again,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
I	1
gather	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
a	1
name	1
and	1
a	1
praise	1
among	1
all	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
when	1
I	1
turn	1
back	1
your	1
captivity	1
before	1
your	1
eyes,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1

	1
Haggai	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king,	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
This	1
people	1
say,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
come,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
should	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
1:3	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:4	1
Is	1
it	1
time	1
for	1
you,	1
O	1
ye,	1
to	1
dwell	1
in	1
your	1
cieled	1
houses,	1
and	1
this	1
house	1
lie	1
waste?	1
	1
1:5	1
Now	1
therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:6	1
Ye	1
have	1
sown	1
much,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
little;	1
ye	1
eat,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
enough;	1
ye	1
drink,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
filled	1
with	1
drink;	1
ye	1
clothe	1
you,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
warm;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
earneth	1
wages	1
earneth	1
wages	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
bag	1
with	1
holes.	1
	1
1:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Consider	1
your	1
ways.	1
	1
1:8	1
Go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mountain,	1
and	1
bring	1
wood,	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
glorified,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:9	1
Ye	1
looked	1
for	1
much,	1
and,	1
lo	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
little;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
brought	1
it	1
home,	1
I	1
did	1
blow	1
upon	1
it.	1
Why?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
Because	1
of	1
mine	1
house	1
that	1
is	1
waste,	1
and	1
ye	1
run	1
every	1
man	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:10	1
Therefore	1
the	1
heaven	1
over	1
you	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
dew,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
stayed	1
from	1
her	1
fruit.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
drought	1
upon	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
new	1
wine,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
oil,	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
ground	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
and	1
upon	1
men,	1
and	1
upon	1
cattle,	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
labour	1
of	1
the	1
hands.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
and	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
obeyed	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
had	1
sent	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
did	1
fear	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:13	1
Then	1
spake	1
Haggai	1
the	1
LORD's	1
messenger	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
message	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
their	1
God,	1
1:15	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius	1
the	1
king.	1
	1
2:1	1
In	1
the	1
seventh	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Haggai,	1
saying,	1
2:2	1
Speak	1
now	1
to	1
Zerubbabel	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
to	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
saying,	1
2:3	1
Who	1
is	1
left	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
saw	1
this	1
house	1
in	1
her	1
first	1
glory?	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
ye	1
see	1
it	1
now?	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
your	1
eyes	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
nothing?	1
	1
2:4	1
Yet	1
now	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
O	1
Joshua,	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
and	1
be	1
strong,	1
all	1
ye	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
work:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
2:5	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
covenanted	1
with	1
you	1
when	1
ye	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
so	1
my	1
spirit	1
remaineth	1
among	1
you:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
2:6	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Yet	1
once,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
dry	1
land;	1
2:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
come:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fill	1
this	1
house	1
with	1
glory,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
The	1
silver	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
the	1
gold	1
is	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
The	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
latter	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
peace,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:10	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
by	1
Haggai	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:11	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Ask	1
now	1
the	1
priests	1
concerning	1
the	1
law,	1
saying,	1
2:12	1
If	1
one	1
bear	1
holy	1
flesh	1
in	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
skirt	1
do	1
touch	1
bread,	1
or	1
pottage,	1
or	1
wine,	1
or	1
oil,	1
or	1
any	1
meat,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
holy?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
No.	1
	1
2:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Haggai,	1
If	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
unclean	1
by	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
touch	1
any	1
of	1
these,	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
unclean?	1
And	1
the	1
priests	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:14	1
Then	1
answered	1
Haggai,	1
and	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
this	1
nation	1
before	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
work	1
of	1
their	1
hands;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
offer	1
there	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
consider	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
before	1
a	1
stone	1
was	1
laid	1
upon	1
a	1
stone	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
2:16	1
Since	1
those	1
days	1
were,	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
heap	1
of	1
twenty	1
measures,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
ten:	1
when	1
one	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
pressfat	1
for	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
fifty	1
vessels	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
there	1
were	1
but	1
twenty.	1
	1
2:17	1
I	1
smote	1
you	1
with	1
blasting	1
and	1
with	1
mildew	1
and	1
with	1
hail	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
your	1
hands;	1
yet	1
ye	1
turned	1
not	1
to	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:18	1
Consider	1
now	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
and	1
upward,	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
LORD's	1
temple	1
was	1
laid,	1
consider	1
it.	1
	1
2:19	1
Is	1
the	1
seed	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
barn?	1
yea,	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
vine,	1
and	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
the	1
pomegranate,	1
and	1
the	1
olive	1
tree,	1
hath	1
not	1
brought	1
forth:	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
bless	1
you.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Haggai	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
month,	1
saying,	1
2:21	1
Speak	1
to	1
Zerubbabel,	1
governor	1
of	1
Judah,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
earth;	1
2:22	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
heathen;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
overthrow	1
the	1
chariots,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
ride	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
horses	1
and	1
their	1
riders	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
every	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
2:23	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
will	1
I	1
take	1
thee,	1
O	1
Zerubbabel,	1
my	1
servant,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Shealtiel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
signet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Zechariah	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
eighth	1
month,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:2	1
The	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
1:3	1
Therefore	1
say	1
thou	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:4	1
Be	1
ye	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
former	1
prophets	1
have	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Turn	1
ye	1
now	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
ways,	1
and	1
from	1
your	1
evil	1
doings:	1
but	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
hear,	1
nor	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:5	1
Your	1
fathers,	1
where	1
are	1
they?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
do	1
they	1
live	1
for	1
ever?	1
	1
1:6	1
But	1
my	1
words	1
and	1
my	1
statutes,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
my	1
servants	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
they	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
your	1
fathers?	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
said,	1
Like	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
thought	1
to	1
do	1
unto	1
us,	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
ways,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
doings,	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
dealt	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:7	1
Upon	1
the	1
four	1
and	1
twentieth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
eleventh	1
month,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
month	1
Sebat,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year	1
of	1
Darius,	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Berechiah,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Iddo	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:8	1
I	1
saw	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
riding	1
upon	1
a	1
red	1
horse,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
behind	1
him	1
were	1
there	1
red	1
horses,	1
speckled,	1
and	1
white.	1
	1
1:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
O	1
my	1
lord,	1
what	1
are	1
these?	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
thee	1
what	1
these	1
be.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
they	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
stood	1
among	1
the	1
myrtle	1
trees,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
sitteth	1
still,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
rest.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
how	1
long	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Judah,	1
against	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
indignation	1
these	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten	1
years?	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
answered	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
with	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
comfortable	1
words.	1
	1
1:14	1
So	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
communed	1
with	1
me	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cry	1
thou,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
am	1
jealous	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
jealousy.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sore	1
displeased	1
with	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
ease:	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
displeased,	1
and	1
they	1
helped	1
forward	1
the	1
affliction.	1
	1
1:16	1
Therefore	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
mercies:	1
my	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
built	1
in	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
a	1
line	1
shall	1
be	1
stretched	1
forth	1
upon	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:17	1
Cry	1
yet,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
My	1
cities	1
through	1
prosperity	1
shall	1
yet	1
be	1
spread	1
abroad;	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
yet	1
comfort	1
Zion,	1
and	1
shall	1
yet	1
choose	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:18	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw,	1
and	1
behold	1
four	1
horns.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
be	1
these?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
Israel,	1
and	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shewed	1
me	1
four	1
carpenters.	1
	1
1:21	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
What	1
come	1
these	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
spake,	1
saying,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
horns	1
which	1
have	1
scattered	1
Judah,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
did	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
head:	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
fray	1
them,	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
horn	1
over	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judah	1
to	1
scatter	1
it.	1
	1
2:1	1
I	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes	1
again,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
measuring	1
line	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
2:2	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
measure	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
length	1
thereof.	1
	1
2:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
another	1
angel	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
2:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Run,	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
saying,	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
as	1
towns	1
without	1
walls	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
cattle	1
therein:	1
2:5	1
For	1
I,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
will	1
be	1
unto	1
her	1
a	1
wall	1
of	1
fire	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
2:6	1
Ho,	1
ho,	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
north,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
spread	1
you	1
abroad	1
as	1
the	1
four	1
winds	1
of	1
the	1
heaven,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:7	1
Deliver	1
thyself,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
that	1
dwellest	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Babylon.	1
	1
2:8	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
After	1
the	1
glory	1
hath	1
he	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
spoiled	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
toucheth	1
you	1
toucheth	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
his	1
eye.	1
	1
2:9	1
For,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
shake	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
spoil	1
to	1
their	1
servants:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
2:10	1
Sing	1
and	1
rejoice,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion:	1
for,	1
lo,	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
many	1
nations	1
shall	1
be	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
inherit	1
Judah	1
his	1
portion	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
land,	1
and	1
shall	1
choose	1
Jerusalem	1
again.	1
	1
2:13	1
Be	1
silent,	1
O	1
all	1
flesh,	1
before	1
the	1
LORD:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
raised	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
habitation.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
me	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
Satan	1
standing	1
at	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
resist	1
him.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
Satan,	1
The	1
LORD	1
rebuke	1
thee,	1
O	1
Satan;	1
even	1
the	1
LORD	1
that	1
hath	1
chosen	1
Jerusalem	1
rebuke	1
thee:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
brand	1
plucked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fire?	1
	1
3:3	1
Now	1
Joshua	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
filthy	1
garments,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
angel.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
away	1
the	1
filthy	1
garments	1
from	1
him.	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
caused	1
thine	1
iniquity	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
clothe	1
thee	1
with	1
change	1
of	1
raiment.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Let	1
them	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head.	1
So	1
they	1
set	1
a	1
fair	1
mitre	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
garments.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
stood	1
by.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
protested	1
unto	1
Joshua,	1
saying,	1
3:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
walk	1
in	1
my	1
ways,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
my	1
charge,	1
then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
also	1
judge	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
shalt	1
also	1
keep	1
my	1
courts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
places	1
to	1
walk	1
among	1
these	1
that	1
stand	1
by.	1
	1
3:8	1
Hear	1
now,	1
O	1
Joshua	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
thou,	1
and	1
thy	1
fellows	1
that	1
sit	1
before	1
thee:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
men	1
wondered	1
at:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
forth	1
my	1
servant	1
the	1
BRANCH.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
behold	1
the	1
stone	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
before	1
Joshua;	1
upon	1
one	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
seven	1
eyes:	1
behold,	1
I	1
will	1
engrave	1
the	1
graving	1
thereof,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
remove	1
the	1
iniquity	1
of	1
that	1
land	1
in	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
3:10	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
shall	1
ye	1
call	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
neighbour	1
under	1
the	1
vine	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
waked	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
wakened	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
candlestick	1
all	1
of	1
gold,	1
with	1
a	1
bowl	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
his	1
seven	1
lamps	1
thereon,	1
and	1
seven	1
pipes	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
lamps,	1
which	1
are	1
upon	1
the	1
top	1
thereof:	1
4:3	1
And	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
by	1
it,	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bowl,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof.	1
	1
4:4	1
So	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
saying,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:6	1
Then	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
unto	1
Zerubbabel,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
by	1
might,	1
nor	1
by	1
power,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
spirit,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
4:7	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
O	1
great	1
mountain?	1
before	1
Zerubbabel	1
thou	1
shalt	1
become	1
a	1
plain:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
headstone	1
thereof	1
with	1
shoutings,	1
crying,	1
Grace,	1
grace	1
unto	1
it.	1
	1
4:8	1
Moreover	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
4:9	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
this	1
house;	1
his	1
hands	1
shall	1
also	1
finish	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
4:10	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
despised	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
small	1
things?	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
plummet	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Zerubbabel	1
with	1
those	1
seven;	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
run	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
answered	1
I,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
trees	1
upon	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
candlestick	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
thereof?	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
I	1
answered	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
be	1
these	1
two	1
olive	1
branches	1
which	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
golden	1
pipes	1
empty	1
the	1
golden	1
oil	1
out	1
of	1
themselves?	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
me	1
and	1
said,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
what	1
these	1
be?	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
No,	1
my	1
lord.	1
	1
4:14	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
anointed	1
ones,	1
that	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
5:1	1
Then	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
flying	1
roll.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
What	1
seest	1
thou?	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
flying	1
roll;	1
the	1
length	1
thereof	1
is	1
twenty	1
cubits,	1
and	1
the	1
breadth	1
thereof	1
ten	1
cubits.	1
	1
5:3	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
me,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
curse	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
stealeth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
sweareth	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
as	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
according	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
5:4	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
forth,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
thief,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sweareth	1
falsely	1
by	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
shall	1
consume	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
timber	1
thereof	1
and	1
the	1
stones	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:5	1
Then	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lift	1
up	1
now	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
ephah	1
that	1
goeth	1
forth.	1
He	1
said	1
moreover,	1
This	1
is	1
their	1
resemblance	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
lifted	1
up	1
a	1
talent	1
of	1
lead:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
sitteth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
wickedness.	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
ephah;	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
lead	1
upon	1
the	1
mouth	1
thereof.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
lifted	1
I	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
two	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
wings;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
wings	1
like	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
a	1
stork:	1
and	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
ephah	1
between	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
Whither	1
do	1
these	1
bear	1
the	1
ephah?	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
To	1
build	1
it	1
an	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Shinar:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
established,	1
and	1
set	1
there	1
upon	1
her	1
own	1
base.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
I	1
turned,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
looked,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
four	1
chariots	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
two	1
mountains;	1
and	1
the	1
mountains	1
were	1
mountains	1
of	1
brass.	1
	1
6:2	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
chariot	1
were	1
red	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
chariot	1
black	1
horses;	1
6:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
chariot	1
white	1
horses;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
chariot	1
grisled	1
and	1
bay	1
horses.	1
	1
6:4	1
Then	1
I	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel	1
that	1
talked	1
with	1
me,	1
What	1
are	1
these,	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
four	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
heavens,	1
which	1
go	1
forth	1
from	1
standing	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:6	1
The	1
black	1
horses	1
which	1
are	1
therein	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
north	1
country;	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
go	1
forth	1
after	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
grisled	1
go	1
forth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
country.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
bay	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
go	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth:	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
Get	1
you	1
hence,	1
walk	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
So	1
they	1
walked	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
6:8	1
Then	1
cried	1
he	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
that	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
north	1
country	1
have	1
quieted	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
country.	1
	1
6:9	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
6:10	1
Take	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
captivity,	1
even	1
of	1
Heldai,	1
of	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
of	1
Jedaiah,	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
from	1
Babylon,	1
and	1
come	1
thou	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Josiah	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah;	1
6:11	1
Then	1
take	1
silver	1
and	1
gold,	1
and	1
make	1
crowns,	1
and	1
set	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Joshua	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Josedech,	1
the	1
high	1
priest;	1
6:12	1
And	1
speak	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
The	1
BRANCH;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
grow	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
place,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
6:13	1
Even	1
he	1
shall	1
build	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
bear	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
and	1
rule	1
upon	1
his	1
throne;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
priest	1
upon	1
his	1
throne:	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
be	1
between	1
them	1
both.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
the	1
crowns	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
Helem,	1
and	1
to	1
Tobijah,	1
and	1
to	1
Jedaiah,	1
and	1
to	1
Hen	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zephaniah,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
far	1
off	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
build	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
unto	1
you.	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
diligently	1
obey	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
7:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
year	1
of	1
king	1
Darius,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ninth	1
month,	1
even	1
in	1
Chisleu;	1
7:2	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
Sherezer	1
and	1
Regemmelech,	1
and	1
their	1
men,	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
7:3	1
And	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
priests	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prophets,	1
saying,	1
Should	1
I	1
weep	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
month,	1
separating	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
so	1
many	1
years?	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
7:5	1
Speak	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
priests,	1
saying,	1
When	1
ye	1
fasted	1
and	1
mourned	1
in	1
the	1
fifth	1
and	1
seventh	1
month,	1
even	1
those	1
seventy	1
years,	1
did	1
ye	1
at	1
all	1
fast	1
unto	1
me,	1
even	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
did	1
drink,	1
did	1
not	1
ye	1
eat	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
drink	1
for	1
yourselves?	1
7:7	1
Should	1
ye	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
cried	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets,	1
when	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
inhabited	1
and	1
in	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
the	1
cities	1
thereof	1
round	1
about	1
her,	1
when	1
men	1
inhabited	1
the	1
south	1
and	1
the	1
plain?	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
Zechariah,	1
saying,	1
7:9	1
Thus	1
speaketh	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
saying,	1
Execute	1
true	1
judgment,	1
and	1
shew	1
mercy	1
and	1
compassions	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
brother:	1
7:10	1
And	1
oppress	1
not	1
the	1
widow,	1
nor	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
the	1
stranger,	1
nor	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
against	1
his	1
brother	1
in	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
7:11	1
But	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
hearken,	1
and	1
pulled	1
away	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear.	1
	1
7:12	1
Yea,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
hearts	1
as	1
an	1
adamant	1
stone,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
sent	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
prophets:	1
therefore	1
came	1
a	1
great	1
wrath	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
7:13	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
cried,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
hear;	1
so	1
they	1
cried,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hear,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
7:14	1
But	1
I	1
scattered	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
whirlwind	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
whom	1
they	1
knew	1
not.	1
Thus	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
desolate	1
after	1
them,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
passed	1
through	1
nor	1
returned:	1
for	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
pleasant	1
land	1
desolate.	1
	1
8:1	1
Again	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:2	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
Zion	1
with	1
great	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
jealous	1
for	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
fury.	1
	1
8:3	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD;	1
I	1
am	1
returned	1
unto	1
Zion,	1
and	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
the	1
mountain	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
the	1
holy	1
mountain.	1
	1
8:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
There	1
shall	1
yet	1
old	1
men	1
and	1
old	1
women	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
very	1
age.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
boys	1
and	1
girls	1
playing	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
thereof.	1
	1
8:6	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
in	1
these	1
days,	1
should	1
it	1
also	1
be	1
marvellous	1
in	1
mine	1
eyes?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:7	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
my	1
people	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west	1
country;	1
8:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
people,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
God,	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:9	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
Let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong,	1
ye	1
that	1
hear	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
these	1
words	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
was	1
laid,	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
might	1
be	1
built.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hire	1
for	1
man,	1
nor	1
any	1
hire	1
for	1
beast;	1
neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
peace	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
went	1
out	1
or	1
came	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
affliction:	1
for	1
I	1
set	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
days,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
8:12	1
For	1
the	1
seed	1
shall	1
be	1
prosperous;	1
the	1
vine	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
fruit,	1
and	1
the	1
ground	1
shall	1
give	1
her	1
increase,	1
and	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
give	1
their	1
dew;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
remnant	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
to	1
possess	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
a	1
curse	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
O	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
house	1
of	1
Israel;	1
so	1
will	1
I	1
save	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
blessing:	1
fear	1
not,	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
hands	1
be	1
strong.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
As	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
punish	1
you,	1
when	1
your	1
fathers	1
provoked	1
me	1
to	1
wrath,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
I	1
repented	1
not:	1
8:15	1
So	1
again	1
have	1
I	1
thought	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah:	1
fear	1
ye	1
not.	1
	1
8:16	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
do;	1
Speak	1
ye	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
execute	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
gates:	1
8:17	1
And	1
let	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
imagine	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts	1
against	1
his	1
neighbour;	1
and	1
love	1
no	1
false	1
oath:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
hate,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
came	1
unto	1
me,	1
saying,	1
8:19	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
The	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fourth	1
month,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
fifth,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
seventh,	1
and	1
the	1
fast	1
of	1
the	1
tenth,	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness,	1
and	1
cheerful	1
feasts;	1
therefore	1
love	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:20	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
It	1
shall	1
yet	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
come	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
many	1
cities:	1
8:21	1
And	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
one	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
another,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
speedily	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
also.	1
	1
8:22	1
Yea,	1
many	1
people	1
and	1
strong	1
nations	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
to	1
pray	1
before	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
8:23	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
ten	1
men	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
languages	1
of	1
the	1
nations,	1
even	1
shall	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Hadrach,	1
and	1
Damascus	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
rest	1
thereof:	1
when	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
man,	1
as	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
shall	1
be	1
toward	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
Hamath	1
also	1
shall	1
border	1
thereby;	1
Tyrus,	1
and	1
Zidon,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
very	1
wise.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
Tyrus	1
did	1
build	1
herself	1
a	1
strong	1
hold,	1
and	1
heaped	1
up	1
silver	1
as	1
the	1
dust,	1
and	1
fine	1
gold	1
as	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
9:4	1
Behold,	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
cast	1
her	1
out,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
smite	1
her	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
devoured	1
with	1
fire.	1
	1
9:5	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
fear;	1
Gaza	1
also	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
Ekron;	1
for	1
her	1
expectation	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed;	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
perish	1
from	1
Gaza,	1
and	1
Ashkelon	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
inhabited.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
a	1
bastard	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
Ashdod,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
the	1
Philistines.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
away	1
his	1
blood	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
his	1
abominations	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
teeth:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
remaineth,	1
even	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
our	1
God,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
a	1
governor	1
in	1
Judah,	1
and	1
Ekron	1
as	1
a	1
Jebusite.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
encamp	1
about	1
mine	1
house	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
passeth	1
by,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
returneth:	1
and	1
no	1
oppressor	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
them	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
now	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
with	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:9	1
Rejoice	1
greatly,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Zion;	1
shout,	1
O	1
daughter	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee:	1
he	1
is	1
just,	1
and	1
having	1
salvation;	1
lowly,	1
and	1
riding	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
upon	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
chariot	1
from	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
the	1
horse	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
bow	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
peace	1
unto	1
the	1
heathen:	1
and	1
his	1
dominion	1
shall	1
be	1
from	1
sea	1
even	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
river	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:11	1
As	1
for	1
thee	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
forth	1
thy	1
prisoners	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
wherein	1
is	1
no	1
water.	1
	1
9:12	1
Turn	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
strong	1
hold,	1
ye	1
prisoners	1
of	1
hope:	1
even	1
to	1
day	1
do	1
I	1
declare	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
double	1
unto	1
thee;	1
9:13	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
bent	1
Judah	1
for	1
me,	1
filled	1
the	1
bow	1
with	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
raised	1
up	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Zion,	1
against	1
thy	1
sons,	1
O	1
Greece,	1
and	1
made	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
man.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
seen	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
his	1
arrow	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
lightning:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
God	1
shall	1
blow	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
with	1
whirlwinds	1
of	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
9:15	1
The	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
shall	1
defend	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour,	1
and	1
subdue	1
with	1
sling	1
stones;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
drink,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
through	1
wine;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
like	1
bowls,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God	1
shall	1
save	1
them	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
his	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
a	1
crown,	1
lifted	1
up	1
as	1
an	1
ensign	1
upon	1
his	1
land.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
goodness,	1
and	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
his	1
beauty!	1
corn	1
shall	1
make	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
new	1
wine	1
the	1
maids.	1
	1
10:1	1
Ask	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
rain	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
rain;	1
so	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
make	1
bright	1
clouds,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
showers	1
of	1
rain,	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
the	1
idols	1
have	1
spoken	1
vanity,	1
and	1
the	1
diviners	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
have	1
told	1
false	1
dreams;	1
they	1
comfort	1
in	1
vain:	1
therefore	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way	1
as	1
a	1
flock,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:3	1
Mine	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled	1
against	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
I	1
punished	1
the	1
goats:	1
for	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
flock	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
hath	1
made	1
them	1
as	1
his	1
goodly	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
battle.	1
	1
10:4	1
Out	1
of	1
him	1
came	1
forth	1
the	1
corner,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
nail,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
battle	1
bow,	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
every	1
oppressor	1
together.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
mighty	1
men,	1
which	1
tread	1
down	1
their	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
in	1
the	1
battle:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
fight,	1
because	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
riders	1
on	1
horses	1
shall	1
be	1
confounded.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
save	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
to	1
place	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
cast	1
them	1
off:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD	1
their	1
God,	1
and	1
will	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
Ephraim	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
mighty	1
man,	1
and	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
as	1
through	1
wine:	1
yea,	1
their	1
children	1
shall	1
see	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
glad;	1
their	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
10:8	1
I	1
will	1
hiss	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
gather	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
redeemed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
increase	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
increased.	1
	1
10:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
sow	1
them	1
among	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
far	1
countries;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
live	1
with	1
their	1
children,	1
and	1
turn	1
again.	1
	1
10:10	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
again	1
also	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
Assyria;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gilead	1
and	1
Lebanon;	1
and	1
place	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
them.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
with	1
affliction,	1
and	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
deeps	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
shall	1
dry	1
up:	1
and	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Assyria	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
Egypt	1
shall	1
depart	1
away.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
strengthen	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
LORD;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:1	1
Open	1
thy	1
doors,	1
O	1
Lebanon,	1
that	1
the	1
fire	1
may	1
devour	1
thy	1
cedars.	1
	1
11:2	1
Howl,	1
fir	1
tree;	1
for	1
the	1
cedar	1
is	1
fallen;	1
because	1
the	1
mighty	1
are	1
spoiled:	1
howl,	1
O	1
ye	1
oaks	1
of	1
Bashan;	1
for	1
the	1
forest	1
of	1
the	1
vintage	1
is	1
come	1
down.	1
	1
11:3	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds;	1
for	1
their	1
glory	1
is	1
spoiled:	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
roaring	1
of	1
young	1
lions;	1
for	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
Jordan	1
is	1
spoiled.	1
	1
11:4	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God;	1
Feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
11:5	1
Whose	1
possessors	1
slay	1
them,	1
and	1
hold	1
themselves	1
not	1
guilty:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sell	1
them	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
LORD;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
rich:	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
shepherds	1
pity	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
more	1
pity	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
but,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
the	1
men	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
neighbour's	1
hand,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
king:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
smite	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deliver	1
them.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
feed	1
the	1
flock	1
of	1
slaughter,	1
even	1
you,	1
O	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
staves;	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
called	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
called	1
Bands;	1
and	1
I	1
fed	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
11:8	1
Three	1
shepherds	1
also	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
in	1
one	1
month;	1
and	1
my	1
soul	1
lothed	1
them,	1
and	1
their	1
soul	1
also	1
abhorred	1
me.	1
	1
11:9	1
Then	1
said	1
I,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
feed	1
you:	1
that	1
that	1
dieth,	1
let	1
it	1
die;	1
and	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
cut	1
off;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
rest	1
eat	1
every	1
one	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
staff,	1
even	1
Beauty,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
asunder,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
my	1
covenant	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
broken	1
in	1
that	1
day:	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
poor	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
that	1
waited	1
upon	1
me	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
think	1
good,	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
price;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
forbear.	1
So	1
they	1
weighed	1
for	1
my	1
price	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
11:13	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
potter:	1
a	1
goodly	1
price	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
prised	1
at	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
potter	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
I	1
cut	1
asunder	1
mine	1
other	1
staff,	1
even	1
Bands,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
break	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
between	1
Judah	1
and	1
Israel.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
unto	1
thee	1
yet	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
a	1
foolish	1
shepherd.	1
	1
11:16	1
For,	1
lo,	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
up	1
a	1
shepherd	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
visit	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
cut	1
off,	1
neither	1
shall	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
one,	1
nor	1
heal	1
that	1
that	1
is	1
broken,	1
nor	1
feed	1
that	1
that	1
standeth	1
still:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
fat,	1
and	1
tear	1
their	1
claws	1
in	1
pieces.	1
	1
11:17	1
Woe	1
to	1
the	1
idol	1
shepherd	1
that	1
leaveth	1
the	1
flock!	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
right	1
eye:	1
his	1
arm	1
shall	1
be	1
clean	1
dried	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
eye	1
shall	1
be	1
utterly	1
darkened.	1
	1
12:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
which	1
stretcheth	1
forth	1
the	1
heavens,	1
and	1
layeth	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
formeth	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
within	1
him.	1
	1
12:2	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
trembling	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
siege	1
both	1
against	1
Judah	1
and	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
burdensome	1
stone	1
for	1
all	1
people:	1
all	1
that	1
burden	1
themselves	1
with	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
in	1
pieces,	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
12:4	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
his	1
rider	1
with	1
madness:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
mine	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judah,	1
and	1
will	1
smite	1
every	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
blindness.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
12:6	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
will	1
I	1
make	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Judah	1
like	1
an	1
hearth	1
of	1
fire	1
among	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
torch	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
sheaf;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
devour	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
round	1
about,	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
left:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
inhabited	1
again	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
place,	1
even	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:7	1
The	1
LORD	1
also	1
shall	1
save	1
the	1
tents	1
of	1
Judah	1
first,	1
that	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
do	1
not	1
magnify	1
themselves	1
against	1
Judah.	1
	1
12:8	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
defend	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
feeble	1
among	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
God,	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
against	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
supplications:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
pierced,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
mourn	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
mourneth	1
for	1
his	1
only	1
son,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
bitterness	1
for	1
his	1
firstborn.	1
	1
12:11	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
mourning	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
as	1
the	1
mourning	1
of	1
Hadadrimmon	1
in	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
Megiddon.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
mourn,	1
every	1
family	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Nathan	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:13	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Levi	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Shimei	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart;	1
12:14	1
All	1
the	1
families	1
that	1
remain,	1
every	1
family	1
apart,	1
and	1
their	1
wives	1
apart.	1
	1
13:1	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
fountain	1
opened	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
sin	1
and	1
for	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
idols	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
remembered:	1
and	1
also	1
I	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
any	1
shall	1
yet	1
prophesy,	1
then	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
live;	1
for	1
thou	1
speakest	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
and	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
that	1
begat	1
him	1
shall	1
thrust	1
him	1
through	1
when	1
he	1
prophesieth.	1
	1
13:4	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vision,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
prophesied;	1
neither	1
shall	1
they	1
wear	1
a	1
rough	1
garment	1
to	1
deceive:	1
13:5	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
prophet,	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
husbandman;	1
for	1
man	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
cattle	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
one	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
wounds	1
in	1
thine	1
hands?	1
Then	1
he	1
shall	1
answer,	1
Those	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
wounded	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
friends.	1
	1
13:7	1
Awake,	1
O	1
sword,	1
against	1
my	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
fellow,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
mine	1
hand	1
upon	1
the	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD,	1
two	1
parts	1
therein	1
shall	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
die;	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
therein.	1
	1
13:9	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
the	1
third	1
part	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
will	1
refine	1
them	1
as	1
silver	1
is	1
refined,	1
and	1
will	1
try	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
is	1
tried:	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
them:	1
I	1
will	1
say,	1
It	1
is	1
my	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
is	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
14:1	1
Behold,	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
cometh,	1
and	1
thy	1
spoil	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
all	1
nations	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
battle;	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
houses	1
rifled,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
ravished;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
shall	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
captivity,	1
and	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
14:3	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
LORD	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
fight	1
against	1
those	1
nations,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
fought	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
his	1
feet	1
shall	1
stand	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
which	1
is	1
before	1
Jerusalem	1
on	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
shall	1
cleave	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
thereof	1
toward	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
toward	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
valley;	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
shall	1
remove	1
toward	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
toward	1
the	1
south.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains;	1
for	1
the	1
valley	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
shall	1
reach	1
unto	1
Azal:	1
yea,	1
ye	1
shall	1
flee,	1
like	1
as	1
ye	1
fled	1
from	1
before	1
the	1
earthquake	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Uzziah	1
king	1
of	1
Judah:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
my	1
God	1
shall	1
come,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
clear,	1
nor	1
dark:	1
14:7	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
day	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
LORD,	1
not	1
day,	1
nor	1
night:	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
at	1
evening	1
time	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
light.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
living	1
waters	1
shall	1
go	1
out	1
from	1
Jerusalem;	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
former	1
sea,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
them	1
toward	1
the	1
hinder	1
sea:	1
in	1
summer	1
and	1
in	1
winter	1
shall	1
it	1
be.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
king	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth:	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
one	1
LORD,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
one.	1
	1
14:10	1
All	1
the	1
land	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
as	1
a	1
plain	1
from	1
Geba	1
to	1
Rimmon	1
south	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
lifted	1
up,	1
and	1
inhabited	1
in	1
her	1
place,	1
from	1
Benjamin's	1
gate	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
gate,	1
unto	1
the	1
corner	1
gate,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
tower	1
of	1
Hananeel	1
unto	1
the	1
king's	1
winepresses.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
men	1
shall	1
dwell	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
utter	1
destruction;	1
but	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
safely	1
inhabited.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
have	1
fought	1
against	1
Jerusalem;	1
Their	1
flesh	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
while	1
they	1
stand	1
upon	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
holes,	1
and	1
their	1
tongue	1
shall	1
consume	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
mouth.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
tumult	1
from	1
the	1
LORD	1
shall	1
be	1
among	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hold	1
every	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
neighbour.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Judah	1
also	1
shall	1
fight	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
round	1
about	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
together,	1
gold,	1
and	1
silver,	1
and	1
apparel,	1
in	1
great	1
abundance.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
so	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague	1
of	1
the	1
horse,	1
of	1
the	1
mule,	1
of	1
the	1
camel,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
these	1
tents,	1
as	1
this	1
plague.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
which	1
came	1
against	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
even	1
go	1
up	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
be,	1
that	1
whoso	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
King,	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
even	1
upon	1
them	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
rain.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Egypt	1
go	1
not	1
up,	1
and	1
come	1
not,	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
rain;	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
plague,	1
wherewith	1
the	1
LORD	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
heathen	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:19	1
This	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
that	1
come	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles.	1
	1
14:20	1
In	1
that	1
day	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
horses,	1
HOLINESS	1
UNTO	1
THE	1
LORD;	1
and	1
the	1
pots	1
in	1
the	1
LORD's	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
bowls	1
before	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
14:21	1
Yea,	1
every	1
pot	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
and	1
in	1
Judah	1
shall	1
be	1
holiness	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
seethe	1
therein:	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
Canaanite	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
Malachi	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
burden	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
to	1
Israel	1
by	1
Malachi.	1
	1
1:2	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
hast	1
thou	1
loved	1
us?	1
Was	1
not	1
Esau	1
Jacob's	1
brother?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD:	1
yet	1
I	1
loved	1
Jacob,	1
1:3	1
And	1
I	1
hated	1
Esau,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
mountains	1
and	1
his	1
heritage	1
waste	1
for	1
the	1
dragons	1
of	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:4	1
Whereas	1
Edom	1
saith,	1
We	1
are	1
impoverished,	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
and	1
build	1
the	1
desolate	1
places;	1
thus	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
They	1
shall	1
build,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
throw	1
down;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
them,	1
The	1
border	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
and,	1
The	1
people	1
against	1
whom	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
indignation	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
your	1
eyes	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
be	1
magnified	1
from	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:6	1
A	1
son	1
honoureth	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
his	1
master:	1
if	1
then	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
father,	1
where	1
is	1
mine	1
honour?	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
a	1
master,	1
where	1
is	1
my	1
fear?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts	1
unto	1
you,	1
O	1
priests,	1
that	1
despise	1
my	1
name.	1
And	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
despised	1
thy	1
name?	1
	1
1:7	1
Ye	1
offer	1
polluted	1
bread	1
upon	1
mine	1
altar;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
polluted	1
thee?	1
In	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
blind	1
for	1
sacrifice,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
offer	1
the	1
lame	1
and	1
sick,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evil?	1
offer	1
it	1
now	1
unto	1
thy	1
governor;	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
thee,	1
or	1
accept	1
thy	1
person?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
now,	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
beseech	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
gracious	1
unto	1
us:	1
this	1
hath	1
been	1
by	1
your	1
means:	1
will	1
he	1
regard	1
your	1
persons?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:10	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
even	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
would	1
shut	1
the	1
doors	1
for	1
nought?	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
kindle	1
fire	1
on	1
mine	1
altar	1
for	1
nought.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
neither	1
will	1
I	1
accept	1
an	1
offering	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
from	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
going	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
incense	1
shall	1
be	1
offered	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
and	1
a	1
pure	1
offering:	1
for	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
the	1
heathen,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
profaned	1
it,	1
in	1
that	1
ye	1
say,	1
The	1
table	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
is	1
polluted;	1
and	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof,	1
even	1
his	1
meat,	1
is	1
contemptible.	1
	1
1:13	1
Ye	1
said	1
also,	1
Behold,	1
what	1
a	1
weariness	1
is	1
it!	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
snuffed	1
at	1
it,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts;	1
and	1
ye	1
brought	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
torn,	1
and	1
the	1
lame,	1
and	1
the	1
sick;	1
thus	1
ye	1
brought	1
an	1
offering:	1
should	1
I	1
accept	1
this	1
of	1
your	1
hand?	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
1:14	1
But	1
cursed	1
be	1
the	1
deceiver,	1
which	1
hath	1
in	1
his	1
flock	1
a	1
male,	1
and	1
voweth,	1
and	1
sacrificeth	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
a	1
corrupt	1
thing:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
great	1
King,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
dreadful	1
among	1
the	1
heathen.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
ye	1
priests,	1
this	1
commandment	1
is	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
2:2	1
If	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
hear,	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart,	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
unto	1
my	1
name,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
send	1
a	1
curse	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
curse	1
your	1
blessings:	1
yea,	1
I	1
have	1
cursed	1
them	1
already,	1
because	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
heart.	1
	1
2:3	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
corrupt	1
your	1
seed,	1
and	1
spread	1
dung	1
upon	1
your	1
faces,	1
even	1
the	1
dung	1
of	1
your	1
solemn	1
feasts;	1
and	1
one	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
away	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
this	1
commandment	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
covenant	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:5	1
My	1
covenant	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
peace;	1
and	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
fear	1
wherewith	1
he	1
feared	1
me,	1
and	1
was	1
afraid	1
before	1
my	1
name.	1
	1
2:6	1
The	1
law	1
of	1
truth	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
iniquity	1
was	1
not	1
found	1
in	1
his	1
lips:	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
equity,	1
and	1
did	1
turn	1
many	1
away	1
from	1
iniquity.	1
	1
2:7	1
For	1
the	1
priest's	1
lips	1
should	1
keep	1
knowledge,	1
and	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
law	1
at	1
his	1
mouth:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:8	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way;	1
ye	1
have	1
caused	1
many	1
to	1
stumble	1
at	1
the	1
law;	1
ye	1
have	1
corrupted	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
Levi,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:9	1
Therefore	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
made	1
you	1
contemptible	1
and	1
base	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
according	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
my	1
ways,	1
but	1
have	1
been	1
partial	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:10	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
all	1
one	1
father?	1
hath	1
not	1
one	1
God	1
created	1
us?	1
why	1
do	1
we	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
every	1
man	1
against	1
his	1
brother,	1
by	1
profaning	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
our	1
fathers?	1
	1
2:11	1
Judah	1
hath	1
dealt	1
treacherously,	1
and	1
an	1
abomination	1
is	1
committed	1
in	1
Israel	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
Judah	1
hath	1
profaned	1
the	1
holiness	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
which	1
he	1
loved,	1
and	1
hath	1
married	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
strange	1
god.	1
	1
2:12	1
The	1
LORD	1
will	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
this,	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
scholar,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tabernacles	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
offereth	1
an	1
offering	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
this	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
again,	1
covering	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
tears,	1
with	1
weeping,	1
and	1
with	1
crying	1
out,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
offering	1
any	1
more,	1
or	1
receiveth	1
it	1
with	1
good	1
will	1
at	1
your	1
hand.	1
	1
2:14	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
been	1
witness	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
youth,	1
against	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
dealt	1
treacherously:	1
yet	1
is	1
she	1
thy	1
companion,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
thy	1
covenant.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
make	1
one?	1
Yet	1
had	1
he	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
spirit.	1
And	1
wherefore	1
one?	1
That	1
he	1
might	1
seek	1
a	1
godly	1
seed.	1
Therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
and	1
let	1
none	1
deal	1
treacherously	1
against	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
youth.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
the	1
LORD,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel,	1
saith	1
that	1
he	1
hateth	1
putting	1
away:	1
for	1
one	1
covereth	1
violence	1
with	1
his	1
garment,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts:	1
therefore	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
your	1
spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
deal	1
not	1
treacherously.	1
	1
2:17	1
Ye	1
have	1
wearied	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
your	1
words.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
wearied	1
him?	1
When	1
ye	1
say,	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
is	1
good	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
he	1
delighteth	1
in	1
them;	1
or,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
judgment?	1
	1
3:1	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
messenger,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
prepare	1
the	1
way	1
before	1
me:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD,	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek,	1
shall	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
temple,	1
even	1
the	1
messenger	1
of	1
the	1
covenant,	1
whom	1
ye	1
delight	1
in:	1
behold,	1
he	1
shall	1
come,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:2	1
But	1
who	1
may	1
abide	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
coming?	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
stand	1
when	1
he	1
appeareth?	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
refiner's	1
fire,	1
and	1
like	1
fullers'	1
soap:	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
sit	1
as	1
a	1
refiner	1
and	1
purifier	1
of	1
silver:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
purify	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Levi,	1
and	1
purge	1
them	1
as	1
gold	1
and	1
silver,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
offer	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD	1
an	1
offering	1
in	1
righteousness.	1
	1
3:4	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
offering	1
of	1
Judah	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
be	1
pleasant	1
unto	1
the	1
LORD,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
old,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
former	1
years.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
near	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
judgment;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
swift	1
witness	1
against	1
the	1
sorcerers,	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
adulterers,	1
and	1
against	1
false	1
swearers,	1
and	1
against	1
those	1
that	1
oppress	1
the	1
hireling	1
in	1
his	1
wages,	1
the	1
widow,	1
and	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
that	1
turn	1
aside	1
the	1
stranger	1
from	1
his	1
right,	1
and	1
fear	1
not	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:6	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
LORD,	1
I	1
change	1
not;	1
therefore	1
ye	1
sons	1
of	1
Jacob	1
are	1
not	1
consumed.	1
	1
3:7	1
Even	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
fathers	1
ye	1
are	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
mine	1
ordinances,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
them.	1
Return	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
you,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
But	1
ye	1
said,	1
Wherein	1
shall	1
we	1
return?	1
	1
3:8	1
Will	1
a	1
man	1
rob	1
God?	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me.	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Wherein	1
have	1
we	1
robbed	1
thee?	1
In	1
tithes	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
3:9	1
Ye	1
are	1
cursed	1
with	1
a	1
curse:	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
robbed	1
me,	1
even	1
this	1
whole	1
nation.	1
	1
3:10	1
Bring	1
ye	1
all	1
the	1
tithes	1
into	1
the	1
storehouse,	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
meat	1
in	1
mine	1
house,	1
and	1
prove	1
me	1
now	1
herewith,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
if	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
you	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
pour	1
you	1
out	1
a	1
blessing,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
room	1
enough	1
to	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
rebuke	1
the	1
devourer	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
destroy	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
your	1
ground;	1
neither	1
shall	1
your	1
vine	1
cast	1
her	1
fruit	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
all	1
nations	1
shall	1
call	1
you	1
blessed:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
delightsome	1
land,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
3:13	1
Your	1
words	1
have	1
been	1
stout	1
against	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
Yet	1
ye	1
say,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
spoken	1
so	1
much	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
3:14	1
Ye	1
have	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
serve	1
God:	1
and	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
kept	1
his	1
ordinance,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
walked	1
mournfully	1
before	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
now	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
proud	1
happy;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
work	1
wickedness	1
are	1
set	1
up;	1
yea,	1
they	1
that	1
tempt	1
God	1
are	1
even	1
delivered.	1
	1
3:16	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD	1
spake	1
often	1
one	1
to	1
another:	1
and	1
the	1
LORD	1
hearkened,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
remembrance	1
was	1
written	1
before	1
him	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
feared	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
thought	1
upon	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
mine,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
jewels;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
spare	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
spareth	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
that	1
serveth	1
him.	1
	1
3:18	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
return,	1
and	1
discern	1
between	1
the	1
righteous	1
and	1
the	1
wicked,	1
between	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
God	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
serveth	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:1	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
day	1
cometh,	1
that	1
shall	1
burn	1
as	1
an	1
oven;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
proud,	1
yea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
do	1
wickedly,	1
shall	1
be	1
stubble:	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
cometh	1
shall	1
burn	1
them	1
up,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
leave	1
them	1
neither	1
root	1
nor	1
branch.	1
	1
4:2	1
But	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
fear	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Sun	1
of	1
righteousness	1
arise	1
with	1
healing	1
in	1
his	1
wings;	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
grow	1
up	1
as	1
calves	1
of	1
the	1
stall.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
tread	1
down	1
the	1
wicked;	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
ashes	1
under	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
your	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
this,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD	1
of	1
hosts.	1
	1
4:4	1
Remember	1
ye	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
my	1
servant,	1
which	1
I	1
commanded	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
Horeb	1
for	1
all	1
Israel,	1
with	1
the	1
statutes	1
and	1
judgments.	1
	1
4:5	1
Behold,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
you	1
Elijah	1
the	1
prophet	1
before	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
dreadful	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
LORD:	1
4:6	1

So	1
all	1
the	1

from	1
Abraham	1
to	1
David	1
are	1
fourteen	1
generations;	1
and	1
from	1

are	1
fourteen	1
generations;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
carrying	1

into	1
Babylon	1
unto	1
Christ	1
are	1
fourteen	1
generations.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
wise:	1
When	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
Mary	1
was	1
espoused	1
to	1
Joseph,	1
before	1
they	1
came	1
together,	1
she	1
was	1
found	1
with	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:19	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
her	1
husband,	1
being	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
publick	1
example,	1
was	1
minded	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away	1
privily.	1
	1
1:20	1
But	1
while	1
he	1
thought	1
on	1
these	1
things,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Joseph,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
fear	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
unto	1
thee	1
Mary	1
thy	1
wife:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
conceived	1
in	1
her	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
she	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
save	1
his	1
people	1
from	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:22	1
Now	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
1:23	1
Behold,	1
a	1
virgin	1
shall	1
be	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
shall	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
Emmanuel,	1
which	1
being	1
interpreted	1
is,	1
God	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
1:24	1
Then	1
Joseph	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
sleep	1
did	1
as	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
bidden	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
wife:	1
1:25	1
And	1
knew	1
her	1
not	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son:	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
2:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod	1
the	1
king,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
wise	1
men	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
2:2	1
Saying,	1
Where	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
his	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
2:3	1
When	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gathered	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
together,	1
he	1
demanded	1
of	1
them	1
where	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
born.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
In	1
Bethlehem	1
of	1
Judaea:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
2:6	1
And	1
thou	1
Bethlehem,	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Juda,	1
art	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
among	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
Juda:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
come	1
a	1
Governor,	1
that	1
shall	1
rule	1
my	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:7	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
privily	1
called	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
enquired	1
of	1
them	1
diligently	1
what	1
time	1
the	1
star	1
appeared.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
said,	1
Go	1
and	1
search	1
diligently	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
child;	1
and	1
when	1
ye	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
bring	1
me	1
word	1
again,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
worship	1
him	1
also.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
king,	1
they	1
departed;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
star,	1
which	1
they	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
east,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
till	1
it	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
where	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
was.	1
	1
2:10	1
When	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
star,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
exceeding	1
great	1
joy.	1
	1
2:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
their	1
treasures,	1
they	1
presented	1
unto	1
him	1
gifts;	1
gold,	1
and	1
frankincense	1
and	1
myrrh.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
Herod,	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
country	1
another	1
way.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
flee	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
there	1
until	1
I	1
bring	1
thee	1
word:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
seek	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
to	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
2:14	1
When	1
he	1
arose,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
2:15	1
And	1
was	1
there	1
until	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Herod:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Out	1
of	1
Egypt	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
2:16	1
Then	1
Herod,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mocked	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men,	1
was	1
exceeding	1
wroth,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
slew	1
all	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
thereof,	1
from	1
two	1
years	1
old	1
and	1
under,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
diligently	1
enquired	1
of	1
the	1
wise	1
men.	1
	1
2:17	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
2:18	1
In	1
Rama	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
heard,	1
lamentation,	1
and	1
weeping,	1
and	1
great	1
mourning,	1
Rachel	1
weeping	1
for	1
her	1
children,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
comforted,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
was	1
dead,	1
behold,	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
appeareth	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
to	1
Joseph	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
2:20	1
Saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
dead	1
which	1
sought	1
the	1
young	1
child's	1
life.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
young	1
child	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:22	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Archelaus	1
did	1
reign	1
in	1
Judaea	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
Herod,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
thither:	1
notwithstanding,	1
being	1
warned	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
dream,	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Galilee:	1
2:23	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nazareth:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophets,	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
Nazarene.	1
	1
3:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
came	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist,	1
preaching	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
3:2	1
And	1
saying,	1
Repent	1
ye:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
John	1
had	1
his	1
raiment	1
of	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
a	1
leathern	1
girdle	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
his	1
meat	1
was	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey.	1
	1
3:5	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
3:6	1
And	1
were	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
Sadducees	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
baptism,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance:	1
3:9	1
And	1
think	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
therefore	1
every	1
tree	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:11	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water	1
unto	1
repentance.	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
mightier	1
than	1
I,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
bear:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:12	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
gather	1
his	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
garner;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
up	1
the	1
chaff	1
with	1
unquenchable	1
fire.	1
	1
3:13	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jordan	1
unto	1
John,	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
John	1
forbad	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
thee,	1
and	1
comest	1
thou	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Suffer	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
now:	1
for	1
thus	1
it	1
becometh	1
us	1
to	1
fulfil	1
all	1
righteousness.	1
Then	1
he	1
suffered	1
him.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
went	1
up	1
straightway	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
the	1
heavens	1
were	1
opened	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
descending	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
lighting	1
upon	1
him:	1
3:17	1
And	1
lo	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
4:1	1
Then	1
was	1
Jesus	1
led	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
fasted	1
forty	1
days	1
and	1
forty	1
nights,	1
he	1
was	1
afterward	1
an	1
hungred.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
tempter	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
that	1
these	1
stones	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
Man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
proceedeth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
setteth	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
4:6	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
concerning	1
thee:	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:7	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
again,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:8	1
Again,	1
the	1
devil	1
taketh	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
exceeding	1
high	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them;	1
4:9	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
fall	1
down	1
and	1
worship	1
me.	1
	1
4:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
hence,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:11	1
Then	1
the	1
devil	1
leaveth	1
him,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
angels	1
came	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:12	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
4:13	1
And	1
leaving	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
is	1
upon	1
the	1
sea	1
coast,	1
in	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Zabulon	1
and	1
Nephthalim:	1
4:14	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
4:15	1
The	1
land	1
of	1
Zabulon,	1
and	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Nephthalim,	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
Galilee	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
4:16	1
The	1
people	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
darkness	1
saw	1
great	1
light;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
region	1
and	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
light	1
is	1
sprung	1
up.	1
	1
4:17	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
preach,	1
and	1
to	1
say,	1
Repent:	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
walking	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
saw	1
two	1
brethren,	1
Simon	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Follow	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
they	1
straightway	1
left	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
going	1
on	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
other	1
two	1
brethren,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
Zebedee	1
their	1
father,	1
mending	1
their	1
nets;	1
and	1
he	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
they	1
immediately	1
left	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
his	1
fame	1
went	1
throughout	1
all	1
Syria:	1
and	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
sick	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
and	1
torments,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
palsy;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:25	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
great	1
multitudes	1
of	1
people	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
from	1
Decapolis,	1
and	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
seeing	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
set,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him:	1
5:2	1
And	1
he	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
taught	1
them,	1
saying,	1
5:3	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
poor	1
in	1
spirit:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:4	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
mourn:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
5:5	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
meek:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
5:6	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
do	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst	1
after	1
righteousness:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
5:7	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
merciful:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
5:8	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
pure	1
in	1
heart:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
God.	1
	1
5:9	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
peacemakers:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:10	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
persecuted	1
for	1
righteousness'	1
sake:	1
for	1
theirs	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:11	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
revile	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
say	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil	1
against	1
you	1
falsely,	1
for	1
my	1
sake.	1
	1
5:12	1
Rejoice,	1
and	1
be	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
great	1
is	1
your	1
reward	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
so	1
persecuted	1
they	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
were	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
5:13	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
salt	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
salted?	1
it	1
is	1
thenceforth	1
good	1
for	1
nothing,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
trodden	1
under	1
foot	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
5:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
A	1
city	1
that	1
is	1
set	1
on	1
an	1
hill	1
cannot	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
5:15	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick;	1
and	1
it	1
giveth	1
light	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
5:16	1
Let	1
your	1
light	1
so	1
shine	1
before	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
your	1
good	1
works,	1
and	1
glorify	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:17	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
law,	1
or	1
the	1
prophets:	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy,	1
but	1
to	1
fulfil.	1
	1
5:18	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Till	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
pass,	1
one	1
jot	1
or	1
one	1
tittle	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
5:19	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
break	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
least	1
commandments,	1
and	1
shall	1
teach	1
men	1
so,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
and	1
teach	1
them,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
except	1
your	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
exceed	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
5:21	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
kill	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
5:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
is	1
angry	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
without	1
a	1
cause	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
judgment:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Raca,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
council:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
5:23	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thou	1
bring	1
thy	1
gift	1
to	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
there	1
rememberest	1
that	1
thy	1
brother	1
hath	1
ought	1
against	1
thee;	1
5:24	1
Leave	1
there	1
thy	1
gift	1
before	1
the	1
altar,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
first	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
and	1
then	1
come	1
and	1
offer	1
thy	1
gift.	1
	1
5:25	1
Agree	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
quickly,	1
whiles	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
him;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
the	1
adversary	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
thou	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
5:26	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
come	1
out	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
uttermost	1
farthing.	1
	1
5:27	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
5:28	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
looketh	1
on	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
lust	1
after	1
her	1
hath	1
committed	1
adultery	1
with	1
her	1
already	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
profitable	1
for	1
thee	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
members	1
should	1
perish,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
should	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell.	1
	1
5:31	1
It	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement:	1
5:32	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
saving	1
for	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
fornication,	1
causeth	1
her	1
to	1
commit	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
marry	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
divorced	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
5:33	1
Again,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said	1
by	1
them	1
of	1
old	1
time,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
forswear	1
thyself,	1
but	1
shalt	1
perform	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
thine	1
oaths:	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Swear	1
not	1
at	1
all;	1
neither	1
by	1
heaven;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
God's	1
throne:	1
5:35	1
Nor	1
by	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
footstool:	1
neither	1
by	1
Jerusalem;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
King.	1
	1
5:36	1
Neither	1
shalt	1
thou	1
swear	1
by	1
thy	1
head,	1
because	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
make	1
one	1
hair	1
white	1
or	1
black.	1
	1
5:37	1
But	1
let	1
your	1
communication	1
be,	1
Yea,	1
yea;	1
Nay,	1
nay:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
these	1
cometh	1
of	1
evil.	1
	1
5:38	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
An	1
eye	1
for	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
a	1
tooth	1
for	1
a	1
tooth:	1
5:39	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
resist	1
not	1
evil:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
cheek,	1
turn	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
other	1
also.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
sue	1
thee	1
at	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
coat,	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
thy	1
cloak	1
also.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
compel	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
a	1
mile,	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
twain.	1
	1
5:42	1
Give	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
asketh	1
thee,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
would	1
borrow	1
of	1
thee	1
turn	1
not	1
thou	1
away.	1
	1
5:43	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
hate	1
thine	1
enemy.	1
	1
5:44	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you;	1
5:45	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
he	1
maketh	1
his	1
sun	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
evil	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
unjust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
reward	1
have	1
ye?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
the	1
same?	1
	1
5:47	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
salute	1
your	1
brethren	1
only,	1
what	1
do	1
ye	1
more	1
than	1
others?	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
publicans	1
so?	1
	1
5:48	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
perfect,	1
even	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
is	1
perfect.	1
	1
6:1	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
your	1
alms	1
before	1
men,	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
them:	1
otherwise	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:2	1
Therefore	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
thine	1
alms,	1
do	1
not	1
sound	1
a	1
trumpet	1
before	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
glory	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:3	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
doest	1
alms,	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
left	1
hand	1
know	1
what	1
thy	1
right	1
hand	1
doeth:	1
6:4	1
That	1
thine	1
alms	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
himself	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites	1
are:	1
for	1
they	1
love	1
to	1
pray	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
prayest,	1
enter	1
into	1
thy	1
closet,	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
shut	1
thy	1
door,	1
pray	1
to	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret;	1
and	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:7	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
use	1
not	1
vain	1
repetitions,	1
as	1
the	1
heathen	1
do:	1
for	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
for	1
their	1
much	1
speaking.	1
	1
6:8	1
Be	1
not	1
ye	1
therefore	1
like	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of,	1
before	1
ye	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
6:9	1
After	1
this	1
manner	1
therefore	1
pray	1
ye:	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
6:10	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come,	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
earth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:11	1
Give	1
us	1
this	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
debts,	1
as	1
we	1
forgive	1
our	1
debtors.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation,	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil:	1
For	1
thine	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
the	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
will	1
also	1
forgive	1
you:	1
6:15	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
forgive	1
not	1
men	1
their	1
trespasses,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
6:16	1
Moreover	1
when	1
ye	1
fast,	1
be	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
hypocrites,	1
of	1
a	1
sad	1
countenance:	1
for	1
they	1
disfigure	1
their	1
faces,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
appear	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast.	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
reward.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
thou,	1
when	1
thou	1
fastest,	1
anoint	1
thine	1
head,	1
and	1
wash	1
thy	1
face;	1
6:18	1
That	1
thou	1
appear	1
not	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
fast,	1
but	1
unto	1
thy	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
secret:	1
and	1
thy	1
Father,	1
which	1
seeth	1
in	1
secret,	1
shall	1
reward	1
thee	1
openly.	1
	1
6:19	1
Lay	1
not	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
upon	1
earth,	1
where	1
moth	1
and	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
steal:	1
6:20	1
But	1
lay	1
up	1
for	1
yourselves	1
treasures	1
in	1
heaven,	1
where	1
neither	1
moth	1
nor	1
rust	1
doth	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
where	1
thieves	1
do	1
not	1
break	1
through	1
nor	1
steal:	1
6:21	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
if	1
therefore	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
6:23	1
But	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
be	1
evil,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
darkness,	1
how	1
great	1
is	1
that	1
darkness!	1
	1
6:24	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
6:25	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink;	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
your	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
life	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
than	1
raiment?	1
	1
6:26	1
Behold	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air:	1
for	1
they	1
sow	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
reap,	1
nor	1
gather	1
into	1
barns;	1
yet	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
feedeth	1
them.	1
Are	1
ye	1
not	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
	1
6:27	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
by	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
one	1
cubit	1
unto	1
his	1
stature?	1
	1
6:28	1
And	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
raiment?	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
how	1
they	1
grow;	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
spin:	1
6:29	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
even	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
6:30	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
which	1
to	1
day	1
is,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven,	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
much	1
more	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
6:31	1
Therefore	1
take	1
no	1
thought,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
eat?	1
or,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
drink?	1
or,	1
Wherewithal	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
clothed?	1
	1
6:32	1
(For	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
seek:)	1
for	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
6:33	1
But	1
seek	1
ye	1
first	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
his	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
6:34	1
Take	1
therefore	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
morrow:	1
for	1
the	1
morrow	1
shall	1
take	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
itself.	1
Sufficient	1
unto	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
evil	1
thereof.	1
	1
7:1	1
Judge	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
judged.	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
with	1
what	1
judgment	1
ye	1
judge,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
judged:	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
considerest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:4	1
Or	1
how	1
wilt	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
eye;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
beam	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
7:5	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
first	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye;	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
7:6	1
Give	1
not	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs,	1
neither	1
cast	1
ye	1
your	1
pearls	1
before	1
swine,	1
lest	1
they	1
trample	1
them	1
under	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
turn	1
again	1
and	1
rend	1
you.	1
	1
7:7	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you:	1
7:8	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:9	1
Or	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
you,	1
whom	1
if	1
his	1
son	1
ask	1
bread,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
	1
7:10	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
7:11	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
give	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
7:12	1
Therefore	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
even	1
so	1
to	1
them:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
7:13	1
Enter	1
ye	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
wide	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
broad	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
leadeth	1
to	1
destruction,	1
and	1
many	1
there	1
be	1
which	1
go	1
in	1
thereat:	1
7:14	1
Because	1
strait	1
is	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
narrow	1
is	1
the	1
way,	1
which	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
life,	1
and	1
few	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
7:15	1
Beware	1
of	1
false	1
prophets,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
sheep's	1
clothing,	1
but	1
inwardly	1
they	1
are	1
ravening	1
wolves.	1
	1
7:16	1
Ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them	1
by	1
their	1
fruits.	1
Do	1
men	1
gather	1
grapes	1
of	1
thorns,	1
or	1
figs	1
of	1
thistles?	1
	1
7:17	1
Even	1
so	1
every	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit;	1
but	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:18	1
A	1
good	1
tree	1
cannot	1
bring	1
forth	1
evil	1
fruit,	1
neither	1
can	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
7:19	1
Every	1
tree	1
that	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
7:20	1
Wherefore	1
by	1
their	1
fruits	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
them.	1
	1
7:21	1
Not	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
saith	1
unto	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
7:22	1
Many	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
we	1
not	1
prophesied	1
in	1
thy	1
name?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
have	1
cast	1
out	1
devils?	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
name	1
done	1
many	1
wonderful	1
works?	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
then	1
will	1
I	1
profess	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
you:	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
that	1
work	1
iniquity.	1
	1
7:24	1
Therefore	1
whosoever	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
liken	1
him	1
unto	1
a	1
wise	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
a	1
rock:	1
7:25	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell	1
not:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
heareth	1
these	1
sayings	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them	1
not,	1
shall	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
foolish	1
man,	1
which	1
built	1
his	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
sand:	1
7:27	1
And	1
the	1
rain	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
floods	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
winds	1
blew,	1
and	1
beat	1
upon	1
that	1
house;	1
and	1
it	1
fell:	1
and	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
ended	1
these	1
sayings,	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
7:29	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
having	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
8:1	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
leprosy	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man;	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum,	1
there	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
centurion,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
8:6	1
And	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
my	1
servant	1
lieth	1
at	1
home	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
grievously	1
tormented.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
him.	1
	1
8:8	1
The	1
centurion	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
come	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
word	1
only,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
8:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
soldiers	1
under	1
me:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
man,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
followed,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east	1
and	1
west,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
with	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed,	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
his	1
servant	1
was	1
healed	1
in	1
the	1
selfsame	1
hour.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Peter's	1
house,	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
wife's	1
mother	1
laid,	1
and	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
she	1
arose,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:16	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils:	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
spirits	1
with	1
his	1
word,	1
and	1
healed	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
sick:	1
8:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
Himself	1
took	1
our	1
infirmities,	1
and	1
bare	1
our	1
sicknesses.	1
	1
8:18	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
great	1
multitudes	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
depart	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:19	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
scribe	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
another	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
8:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me;	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
his	1
disciples	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
8:24	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
tempest	1
in	1
the	1
sea,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
the	1
waves:	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
us:	1
we	1
perish.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
fearful,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
8:27	1
But	1
the	1
men	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him!	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gergesenes,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
two	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs,	1
exceeding	1
fierce,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
might	1
pass	1
by	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
8:29	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
What	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
torment	1
us	1
before	1
the	1
time?	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
off	1
from	1
them	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
8:31	1
So	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
cast	1
us	1
out,	1
suffer	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out,	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
herd	1
of	1
swine:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
perished	1
in	1
the	1
waters.	1
	1
8:33	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
kept	1
them	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
told	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
befallen	1
to	1
the	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
8:34	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
passed	1
over,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
9:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
lying	1
on	1
a	1
bed:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
seeing	1
their	1
faith	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy;	1
Son,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
9:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
said	1
within	1
themselves,	1
This	1
man	1
blasphemeth.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts	1
said,	1
Wherefore	1
think	1
ye	1
evil	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
9:5	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
9:6	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
Arise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
unto	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
9:8	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
multitudes	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
such	1
power	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
forth	1
from	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man,	1
named	1
Matthew,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
behold,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
came	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Why	1
eateth	1
your	1
Master	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
9:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
be	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
go	1
ye	1
and	1
learn	1
what	1
that	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
9:14	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast	1
oft,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
mourn,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
but	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast.	1
	1
9:16	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
unto	1
an	1
old	1
garment,	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
in	1
to	1
fill	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
from	1
the	1
garment,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
9:17	1
Neither	1
do	1
men	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
bottles	1
break,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
runneth	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
perish:	1
but	1
they	1
put	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
new	1
bottles,	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
9:18	1
While	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
My	1
daughter	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
dead:	1
but	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hand	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
arose,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
diseased	1
with	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
9:21	1
For	1
she	1
said	1
within	1
herself,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
but	1
touch	1
his	1
garment,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
said,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
hour.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
ruler's	1
house,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
minstrels	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
making	1
a	1
noise,	1
9:24	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
place:	1
for	1
the	1
maid	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
	1
9:25	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
put	1
forth,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
maid	1
arose.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
hereof	1
went	1
abroad	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
land.	1
	1
9:27	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
thence,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
followed	1
him,	1
crying,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
blind	1
men	1
came	1
to	1
him:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Believe	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
this?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:29	1
Then	1
touched	1
he	1
their	1
eyes,	1
saying,	1
According	1
to	1
your	1
faith	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
See	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
departed,	1
spread	1
abroad	1
his	1
fame	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
country.	1
	1
9:32	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
behold,	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
dumb	1
man	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake:	1
and	1
the	1
multitudes	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
was	1
never	1
so	1
seen	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
sickness	1
and	1
every	1
disease	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
9:36	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
he	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
fainted,	1
and	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad,	1
as	1
sheep	1
having	1
no	1
shepherd.	1
	1
9:37	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
plenteous,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few;	1
9:38	1
Pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
against	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
to	1
cast	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
sickness	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
disease.	1
	1
10:2	1
Now	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
are	1
these;	1
The	1
first,	1
Simon,	1
who	1
is	1
called	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother;	1
10:3	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew;	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
Matthew	1
the	1
publican;	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Lebbaeus,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Thaddaeus;	1
10:4	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
who	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him.	1
	1
10:5	1
These	1
twelve	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
forth,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
into	1
any	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
enter	1
ye	1
not:	1
10:6	1
But	1
go	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
go,	1
preach,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
10:8	1
Heal	1
the	1
sick,	1
cleanse	1
the	1
lepers,	1
raise	1
the	1
dead,	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
freely	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
freely	1
give.	1
	1
10:9	1
Provide	1
neither	1
gold,	1
nor	1
silver,	1
nor	1
brass	1
in	1
your	1
purses,	1
10:10	1
Nor	1
scrip	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
two	1
coats,	1
neither	1
shoes,	1
nor	1
yet	1
staves:	1
for	1
the	1
workman	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
meat.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
or	1
town	1
ye	1
shall	1
enter,	1
enquire	1
who	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
worthy;	1
and	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
go	1
thence.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
salute	1
it.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
house	1
be	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
come	1
upon	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
worthy,	1
let	1
your	1
peace	1
return	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
10:14	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
your	1
words,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
or	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
feet.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:16	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
sheep	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
wolves:	1
be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
wise	1
as	1
serpents,	1
and	1
harmless	1
as	1
doves.	1
	1
10:17	1
But	1
beware	1
of	1
men:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
councils,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
scourge	1
you	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues;	1
10:18	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
governors	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak:	1
for	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak.	1
	1
10:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
speaketh	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
10:21	1
And	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
deliver	1
up	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
child:	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
endureth	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:23	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
persecute	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
city,	1
flee	1
ye	1
into	1
another:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
over	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Israel,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
come.	1
	1
10:24	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master,	1
nor	1
the	1
servant	1
above	1
his	1
lord.	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
disciple	1
that	1
he	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
as	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
called	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
Beelzebub,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
household?	1
	1
10:26	1
Fear	1
them	1
not	1
therefore:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
and	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
10:27	1
What	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
in	1
darkness,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye	1
in	1
light:	1
and	1
what	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
the	1
ear,	1
that	1
preach	1
ye	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
fear	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
but	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
soul:	1
but	1
rather	1
fear	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
both	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
in	1
hell.	1
	1
10:29	1
Are	1
not	1
two	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
farthing?	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
not	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
your	1
Father.	1
	1
10:30	1
But	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
	1
10:31	1
Fear	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore,	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
10:32	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
confess	1
also	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
deny	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
will	1
I	1
also	1
deny	1
before	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:34	1
Think	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
peace	1
on	1
earth:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
peace,	1
but	1
a	1
sword.	1
	1
10:35	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
variance	1
against	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
her	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
a	1
man's	1
foes	1
shall	1
be	1
they	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
household.	1
	1
10:37	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
father	1
or	1
mother	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
son	1
or	1
daughter	1
more	1
than	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:38	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
taketh	1
not	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
followeth	1
after	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:39	1
He	1
that	1
findeth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loseth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
10:40	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
you	1
receiveth	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
prophet	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
prophet	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
prophet's	1
reward;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
righteous	1
man's	1
reward.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
to	1
drink	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
disciple,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
commanding	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
to	1
preach	1
in	1
their	1
cities.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
when	1
John	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come,	1
or	1
do	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
11:4	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
and	1
shew	1
John	1
again	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
do	1
hear	1
and	1
see:	1
11:5	1
The	1
blind	1
receive	1
their	1
sight,	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
and	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
have	1
the	1
gospel	1
preached	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed,	1
Jesus	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
multitudes	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
behold,	1
they	1
that	1
wear	1
soft	1
clothing	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
houses.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
11:11	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
hath	1
not	1
risen	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
notwithstanding	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
from	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
until	1
now	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
suffereth	1
violence,	1
and	1
the	1
violent	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force.	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
prophesied	1
until	1
John.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
will	1
receive	1
it,	1
this	1
is	1
Elias,	1
which	1
was	1
for	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
11:15	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
this	1
generation?	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
their	1
fellows,	1
11:17	1
And	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
lamented.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
nor	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
11:19	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
and	1
they	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
man	1
gluttonous,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners.	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
upbraid	1
the	1
cities	1
wherein	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
mighty	1
works	1
were	1
done,	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
not:	1
11:21	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
repented	1
long	1
ago	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
brought	1
down	1
to	1
hell:	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
thee,	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Sodom,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:24	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Sodom	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:25	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes.	1
	1
11:26	1
Even	1
so,	1
Father:	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
11:27	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
any	1
man	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
11:28	1
Come	1
unto	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
labour	1
and	1
are	1
heavy	1
laden,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
rest.	1
	1
11:29	1
Take	1
my	1
yoke	1
upon	1
you,	1
and	1
learn	1
of	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
meek	1
and	1
lowly	1
in	1
heart:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
rest	1
unto	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
my	1
yoke	1
is	1
easy,	1
and	1
my	1
burden	1
is	1
light.	1
	1
12:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Jesus	1
went	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
through	1
the	1
corn;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn	1
and	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
12:2	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
disciples	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
upon	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:3	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
12:4	1
How	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
eat,	1
neither	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
priests?	1
	1
12:5	1
Or	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
how	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
the	1
priests	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
profane	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
are	1
blameless?	1
12:6	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
one	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
this	1
meaneth,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
not	1
sacrifice,	1
ye	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
condemned	1
the	1
guiltless.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
departed	1
thence,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
their	1
synagogue:	1
12:10	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
his	1
hand	1
withered.	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
man	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
sheep,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
pit	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
lift	1
it	1
out?	1
	1
12:12	1
How	1
much	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
sheep?	1
Wherefore	1
it	1
is	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
12:13	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
forth;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
restored	1
whole,	1
like	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
12:14	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
held	1
a	1
council	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
12:15	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
from	1
thence:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
all;	1
12:16	1
And	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known:	1
12:17	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
12:18	1
Behold	1
my	1
servant,	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen;	1
my	1
beloved,	1
in	1
whom	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
well	1
pleased:	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
my	1
spirit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
judgment	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
12:19	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
strive,	1
nor	1
cry;	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
his	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
	1
12:20	1
A	1
bruised	1
reed	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
smoking	1
flax	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
quench,	1
till	1
he	1
send	1
forth	1
judgment	1
unto	1
victory.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
12:22	1
Then	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
devil,	1
blind,	1
and	1
dumb:	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
him,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
dumb	1
both	1
spake	1
and	1
saw.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
doth	1
not	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
but	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
every	1
city	1
or	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
shall	1
not	1
stand:	1
12:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan,	1
he	1
is	1
divided	1
against	1
himself;	1
how	1
shall	1
then	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
	1
12:27	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
children	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
12:28	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
then	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:29	1
Or	1
else	1
how	1
can	1
one	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man?	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
12:30	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth	1
abroad.	1
	1
12:31	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
manner	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
blasphemy	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men:	1
but	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
men.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
speaketh	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him,	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
12:33	1
Either	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
good,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
good;	1
or	1
else	1
make	1
the	1
tree	1
corrupt,	1
and	1
his	1
fruit	1
corrupt:	1
for	1
the	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:34	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye,	1
being	1
evil,	1
speak	1
good	1
things?	1
	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
12:35	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
good	1
things:	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
evil	1
things.	1
	1
12:36	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
every	1
idle	1
word	1
that	1
men	1
shall	1
speak,	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
thereof	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment.	1
	1
12:37	1
For	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
justified,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
words	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
condemned.	1
	1
12:38	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
12:39	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
evil	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas:	1
12:40	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
whale's	1
belly;	1
so	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
12:41	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineveh	1
shall	1
rise	1
in	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
because	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:42	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
12:43	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest,	1
and	1
findeth	1
none.	1
	1
12:44	1
Then	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
from	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
empty,	1
swept,	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
12:45	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
with	1
himself	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself,	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
Even	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
unto	1
this	1
wicked	1
generation.	1
	1
12:46	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
talked	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
behold,	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren	1
stood	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:47	1
Then	1
one	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
told	1
him,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother?	1
	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
my	1
brethren?	1
	1
12:49	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
toward	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
12:50	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
13:1	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
went	1
Jesus	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
unto	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
many	1
things	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
a	1
sower	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
sow;	1
13:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
seeds	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
them	1
up:	1
13:5	1
Some	1
fell	1
upon	1
stony	1
places,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
they	1
sprung	1
up,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
deepness	1
of	1
earth:	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
they	1
were	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
they	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
them:	1
13:8	1
But	1
other	1
fell	1
into	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixtyfold,	1
some	1
thirtyfold.	1
	1
13:9	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
speakest	1
thou	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables?	1
	1
13:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
given.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
abundance:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
13:13	1
Therefore	1
speak	1
I	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
parables:	1
because	1
they	1
seeing	1
see	1
not;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
hear	1
not,	1
neither	1
do	1
they	1
understand.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
in	1
them	1
is	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
prophecy	1
of	1
Esaias,	1
which	1
saith,	1
By	1
hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
perceive:	1
13:15	1
For	1
this	1
people's	1
heart	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
they	1
have	1
closed;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
should	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
13:16	1
But	1
blessed	1
are	1
your	1
eyes,	1
for	1
they	1
see:	1
and	1
your	1
ears,	1
for	1
they	1
hear.	1
	1
13:17	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
righteous	1
men	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
Hear	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
sower.	1
	1
13:19	1
When	1
any	1
one	1
heareth	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it	1
not,	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
wicked	1
one,	1
and	1
catcheth	1
away	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
received	1
seed	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side.	1
	1
13:20	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
the	1
seed	1
into	1
stony	1
places,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
anon	1
with	1
joy	1
receiveth	1
it;	1
13:21	1
Yet	1
hath	1
he	1
not	1
root	1
in	1
himself,	1
but	1
dureth	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
when	1
tribulation	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
he	1
is	1
offended.	1
	1
13:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
among	1
the	1
thorns	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
he	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
received	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
heareth	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
understandeth	1
it;	1
which	1
also	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
forth,	1
some	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
some	1
thirty.	1
	1
13:24	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
sowed	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:25	1
But	1
while	1
men	1
slept,	1
his	1
enemy	1
came	1
and	1
sowed	1
tares	1
among	1
the	1
wheat,	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
13:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
blade	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
and	1
brought	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
then	1
appeared	1
the	1
tares	1
also.	1
	1
13:27	1
So	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
householder	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
sow	1
good	1
seed	1
in	1
thy	1
field?	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hath	1
it	1
tares?	1
	1
13:28	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
An	1
enemy	1
hath	1
done	1
this.	1
The	1
servants	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
gather	1
them	1
up?	1
	1
13:29	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
lest	1
while	1
ye	1
gather	1
up	1
the	1
tares,	1
ye	1
root	1
up	1
also	1
the	1
wheat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
13:30	1
Let	1
both	1
grow	1
together	1
until	1
the	1
harvest:	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
harvest	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
reapers,	1
Gather	1
ye	1
together	1
first	1
the	1
tares,	1
and	1
bind	1
them	1
in	1
bundles	1
to	1
burn	1
them:	1
but	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
my	1
barn.	1
	1
13:31	1
Another	1
parable	1
put	1
he	1
forth	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
to	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
sowed	1
in	1
his	1
field:	1
13:32	1
Which	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
seeds:	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
grown,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
among	1
herbs,	1
and	1
becometh	1
a	1
tree,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
come	1
and	1
lodge	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
thereof.	1
	1
13:33	1
Another	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
unto	1
them;	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took,	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:34	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
multitude	1
in	1
parables;	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
13:35	1
That	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
open	1
my	1
mouth	1
in	1
parables;	1
I	1
will	1
utter	1
things	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
13:36	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
tares	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
	1
13:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
soweth	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man;	1
13:38	1
The	1
field	1
is	1
the	1
world;	1
the	1
good	1
seed	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
but	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
one;	1
13:39	1
The	1
enemy	1
that	1
sowed	1
them	1
is	1
the	1
devil;	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
the	1
reapers	1
are	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
13:40	1
As	1
therefore	1
the	1
tares	1
are	1
gathered	1
and	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
fire;	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
13:41	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
send	1
forth	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
offend,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
iniquity;	1
13:42	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:43	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
shine	1
forth	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
their	1
Father.	1
Who	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
13:44	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
treasure	1
hid	1
in	1
a	1
field;	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
hath	1
found,	1
he	1
hideth,	1
and	1
for	1
joy	1
thereof	1
goeth	1
and	1
selleth	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
and	1
buyeth	1
that	1
field.	1
	1
13:45	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
merchant	1
man,	1
seeking	1
goodly	1
pearls:	1
13:46	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
one	1
pearl	1
of	1
great	1
price,	1
went	1
and	1
sold	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
bought	1
it.	1
	1
13:47	1
Again,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
net,	1
that	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
gathered	1
of	1
every	1
kind:	1
13:48	1
Which,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
full,	1
they	1
drew	1
to	1
shore,	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
gathered	1
the	1
good	1
into	1
vessels,	1
but	1
cast	1
the	1
bad	1
away.	1
	1
13:49	1
So	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
the	1
angels	1
shall	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
sever	1
the	1
wicked	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
just,	1
13:50	1
And	1
shall	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
furnace	1
of	1
fire:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
wailing	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
13:51	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
understood	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:52	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Therefore	1
every	1
scribe	1
which	1
is	1
instructed	1
unto	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
treasure	1
things	1
new	1
and	1
old.	1
	1
13:53	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
parables,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
13:54	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
astonished,	1
and	1
said,	1
Whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
this	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
these	1
mighty	1
works?	1
	1
13:55	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter's	1
son?	1
is	1
not	1
his	1
mother	1
called	1
Mary?	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Simon,	1
and	1
Judas?	1
	1
13:56	1
And	1
his	1
sisters,	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
with	1
us?	1
Whence	1
then	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
13:57	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
in	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
save	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
13:58	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
many	1
mighty	1
works	1
there	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
	1
14:1	1
At	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
14:2	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
servants,	1
This	1
is	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
14:3	1
For	1
Herod	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife.	1
	1
14:4	1
For	1
John	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
her.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
he	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
counted	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
14:6	1
But	1
when	1
Herod's	1
birthday	1
was	1
kept,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Herodias	1
danced	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod.	1
	1
14:7	1
Whereupon	1
he	1
promised	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
whatsoever	1
she	1
would	1
ask.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
she,	1
being	1
before	1
instructed	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
said,	1
Give	1
me	1
here	1
John	1
Baptist's	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger.	1
	1
14:9	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
sorry:	1
nevertheless	1
for	1
the	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
meat,	1
he	1
commanded	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
he	1
sent,	1
and	1
beheaded	1
John	1
in	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
buried	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
departed	1
thence	1
by	1
ship	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
apart:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
had	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
they	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
their	1
sick.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
evening,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
now	1
past;	1
send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
victuals.	1
	1
14:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
need	1
not	1
depart;	1
give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
here	1
but	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
14:18	1
He	1
said,	1
Bring	1
them	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
loaves	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
multitudes	1
away,	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
apart	1
to	1
pray:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
alone.	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
tossed	1
with	1
waves:	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
were	1
troubled,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
for	1
fear.	1
	1
14:27	1
But	1
straightway	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
thou,	1
bid	1
me	1
come	1
unto	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Come.	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
walked	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
14:30	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
wind	1
boisterous,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid;	1
and	1
beginning	1
to	1
sink,	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
save	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
And	1
immediately	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
wherefore	1
didst	1
thou	1
doubt?	1
14:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased.	1
	1
14:33	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
came	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:34	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
place	1
had	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
into	1
all	1
that	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased;	1
14:36	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
hem	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
were	1
made	1
perfectly	1
whole.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
15:2	1
Why	1
do	1
thy	1
disciples	1
transgress	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders?	1
for	1
they	1
wash	1
not	1
their	1
hands	1
when	1
they	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
15:3	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
transgress	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
by	1
your	1
tradition?	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
God	1
commanded,	1
saying,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother:	1
and,	1
He	1
that	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
15:6	1
And	1
honour	1
not	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
Thus	1
have	1
ye	1
made	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
by	1
your	1
tradition.	1
	1
15:7	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
well	1
did	1
Esaias	1
prophesy	1
of	1
you,	1
saying,	1
15:8	1
This	1
people	1
draweth	1
nigh	1
unto	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips;	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
in	1
vain	1
they	1
do	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hear,	1
and	1
understand:	1
15:11	1
Not	1
that	1
which	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
defileth	1
a	1
man;	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth,	1
this	1
defileth	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
offended,	1
after	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Every	1
plant,	1
which	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
planted,	1
shall	1
be	1
rooted	1
up.	1
	1
15:14	1
Let	1
them	1
alone:	1
they	1
be	1
blind	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
blind.	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind,	1
both	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch.	1
	1
15:15	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Declare	1
unto	1
us	1
this	1
parable.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
yet	1
without	1
understanding?	1
	1
15:17	1
Do	1
not	1
ye	1
yet	1
understand,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
entereth	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
is	1
cast	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught?	1
	1
15:18	1
But	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
proceed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
come	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
heart;	1
and	1
they	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
15:19	1
For	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
murders,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
thefts,	1
false	1
witness,	1
blasphemies:	1
15:20	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
defile	1
a	1
man:	1
but	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands	1
defileth	1
not	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
15:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
thence,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon.	1
	1
15:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Canaan	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
coasts,	1
and	1
cried	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
my	1
daughter	1
is	1
grievously	1
vexed	1
with	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
her	1
away;	1
for	1
she	1
crieth	1
after	1
us.	1
	1
15:24	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sent	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
lost	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:25	1
Then	1
came	1
she	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
to	1
dogs.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Truth,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fall	1
from	1
their	1
masters'	1
table.	1
	1
15:28	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
O	1
woman,	1
great	1
is	1
thy	1
faith:	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
thee	1
even	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
And	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
departed	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
there.	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
having	1
with	1
them	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
blind,	1
dumb,	1
maimed,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them:	1
15:31	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
multitude	1
wondered,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
maimed	1
to	1
be	1
whole,	1
the	1
lame	1
to	1
walk,	1
and	1
the	1
blind	1
to	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
15:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
continue	1
with	1
me	1
now	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting,	1
lest	1
they	1
faint	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
should	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
to	1
fill	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
multitude?	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
little	1
fishes.	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
multitude	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
fishes,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
them,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets	1
full.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
were	1
four	1
thousand	1
men,	1
beside	1
women	1
and	1
children.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
took	1
ship,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Magdala.	1
	1
16:1	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
came,	1
and	1
tempting	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shew	1
them	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:2	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
evening,	1
ye	1
say,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
fair	1
weather:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
foul	1
weather	1
to	1
day:	1
for	1
the	1
sky	1
is	1
red	1
and	1
lowering.	1
O	1
ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky;	1
but	1
can	1
ye	1
not	1
discern	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
the	1
times?	1
	1
16:4	1
A	1
wicked	1
and	1
adulterous	1
generation	1
seeketh	1
after	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Jonas.	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
they	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread.	1
	1
16:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:7	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
taken	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
16:8	1
Which	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith,	1
why	1
reason	1
ye	1
among	1
yourselves,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
no	1
bread?	1
	1
16:9	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
yet	1
understand,	1
neither	1
remember	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:10	1
Neither	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
thousand,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
ye	1
took	1
up?	1
	1
16:11	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
spake	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
you	1
concerning	1
bread,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees?	1
	1
16:12	1
Then	1
understood	1
they	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
not	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
bread,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees.	1
	1
16:13	1
When	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi,	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
am?	1
16:14	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Some	1
say	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
some,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
Jeremias,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
16:15	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou,	1
Simon	1
Barjona:	1
for	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
hath	1
not	1
revealed	1
it	1
unto	1
thee,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
thou	1
art	1
Peter,	1
and	1
upon	1
this	1
rock	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
my	1
church;	1
and	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
hell	1
shall	1
not	1
prevail	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
thee	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
16:20	1
Then	1
charged	1
he	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Jesus	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:21	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
began	1
Jesus	1
to	1
shew	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
suffer	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
16:22	1
Then	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Be	1
it	1
far	1
from	1
thee,	1
Lord:	1
this	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
16:23	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
offence	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
those	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
16:24	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
16:25	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
shall	1
find	1
it.	1
	1
16:26	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
profited,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
his	1
angels;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
shall	1
reward	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
works.	1
	1
16:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
	1
17:1	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
Peter,	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
bringeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart,	1
17:2	1
And	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
did	1
shine	1
as	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
17:3	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias	1
talking	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
here	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
17:5	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold,	1
a	1
bright	1
cloud	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
behold	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased;	1
hear	1
ye	1
him.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
face,	1
and	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:7	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
eyes,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
Jesus	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
the	1
vision	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
until	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
then	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Elias	1
truly	1
shall	1
first	1
come,	1
and	1
restore	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
17:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
come	1
already,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed.	1
Likewise	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
suffer	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
17:13	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
17:15	1
Lord,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
lunatick,	1
and	1
sore	1
vexed:	1
for	1
ofttimes	1
he	1
falleth	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
oft	1
into	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
17:16	1
And	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
cure	1
him.	1
	1
17:17	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
hither	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
17:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
devil;	1
and	1
he	1
departed	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
child	1
was	1
cured	1
from	1
that	1
very	1
hour.	1
	1
17:19	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
Jesus	1
apart,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
of	1
your	1
unbelief:	1
for	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Remove	1
hence	1
to	1
yonder	1
place;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
remove;	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:21	1
Howbeit	1
this	1
kind	1
goeth	1
not	1
out	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
abode	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men:	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
again.	1
	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorry.	1
	1
17:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
they	1
that	1
received	1
tribute	1
money	1
came	1
to	1
Peter,	1
and	1
said,	1
Doth	1
not	1
your	1
master	1
pay	1
tribute?	1
17:25	1
He	1
saith,	1
Yes.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
Jesus	1
prevented	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
Simon?	1
of	1
whom	1
do	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
take	1
custom	1
or	1
tribute?	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
children,	1
or	1
of	1
strangers?	1
	1
17:26	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Of	1
strangers.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Then	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
free.	1
	1
17:27	1
Notwithstanding,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
offend	1
them,	1
go	1
thou	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
cast	1
an	1
hook,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
first	1
cometh	1
up;	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
hast	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
money:	1
that	1
take,	1
and	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
thee.	1
	1
18:1	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
came	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven?	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
called	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
18:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
become	1
as	1
little	1
children,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:4	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
as	1
this	1
little	1
child,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
such	1
little	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
But	1
whoso	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
which	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
18:7	1
Woe	1
unto	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
of	1
offences!	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
offences	1
come;	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
offence	1
cometh!	1
	1
18:8	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
or	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
them	1
off,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
halt	1
or	1
maimed,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
or	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire.	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
it	1
from	1
thee:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
rather	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire.	1
	1
18:10	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
despise	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones;	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
in	1
heaven	1
their	1
angels	1
do	1
always	1
behold	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:11	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
18:12	1
How	1
think	1
ye?	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
gone	1
astray,	1
doth	1
he	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine,	1
and	1
goeth	1
into	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
seeketh	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
gone	1
astray?	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
find	1
it,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
rejoiceth	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
sheep,	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
which	1
went	1
not	1
astray.	1
	1
18:14	1
Even	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
should	1
perish.	1
	1
18:15	1
Moreover	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
go	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
his	1
fault	1
between	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
alone:	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
hear	1
thee,	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
thy	1
brother.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
thee,	1
then	1
take	1
with	1
thee	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
more,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
witnesses	1
every	1
word	1
may	1
be	1
established.	1
	1
18:17	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
them,	1
tell	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
church:	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
neglect	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
church,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
unto	1
thee	1
as	1
an	1
heathen	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:18	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
bind	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
loose	1
on	1
earth	1
shall	1
be	1
loosed	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:19	1
Again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
if	1
two	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
agree	1
on	1
earth	1
as	1
touching	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
ask,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
18:20	1
For	1
where	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
are	1
gathered	1
together	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
there	1
am	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
18:21	1
Then	1
came	1
Peter	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
oft	1
shall	1
my	1
brother	1
sin	1
against	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
forgive	1
him?	1
till	1
seven	1
times?	1
	1
18:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Until	1
seven	1
times:	1
but,	1
Until	1
seventy	1
times	1
seven.	1
	1
18:23	1
Therefore	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
likened	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
servants.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
reckon,	1
one	1
was	1
brought	1
unto	1
him,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
ten	1
thousand	1
talents.	1
	1
18:25	1
But	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
pay,	1
his	1
lord	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sold,	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
payment	1
to	1
be	1
made.	1
	1
18:26	1
The	1
servant	1
therefore	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:27	1
Then	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
and	1
loosed	1
him,	1
and	1
forgave	1
him	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:28	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
servant	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
which	1
owed	1
him	1
an	1
hundred	1
pence:	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
throat,	1
saying,	1
Pay	1
me	1
that	1
thou	1
owest.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
his	1
fellowservant	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
patience	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
thee	1
all.	1
	1
18:30	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not:	1
but	1
went	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
prison,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
the	1
debt.	1
	1
18:31	1
So	1
when	1
his	1
fellowservants	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
sorry,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
unto	1
their	1
lord	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
18:32	1
Then	1
his	1
lord,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
him,	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
O	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant,	1
I	1
forgave	1
thee	1
all	1
that	1
debt,	1
because	1
thou	1
desiredst	1
me:	1
18:33	1
Shouldest	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
have	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thy	1
fellowservant,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
pity	1
on	1
thee?	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
his	1
lord	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
tormentors,	1
till	1
he	1
should	1
pay	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
due	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
18:35	1
So	1
likewise	1
shall	1
my	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
do	1
also	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
ye	1
from	1
your	1
hearts	1
forgive	1
not	1
every	1
one	1
his	1
brother	1
their	1
trespasses.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
19:2	1
And	1
great	1
multitudes	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them	1
there.	1
	1
19:3	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife	1
for	1
every	1
cause?	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read,	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female,	1
19:5	1
And	1
said,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
shall	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife:	1
and	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh?	1
	1
19:6	1
Wherefore	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
19:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
did	1
Moses	1
then	1
command	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
writing	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away?	1
	1
19:8	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Moses	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
hearts	1
suffered	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
your	1
wives:	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
fornication,	1
and	1
shall	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whoso	1
marrieth	1
her	1
which	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
doth	1
commit	1
adultery.	1
	1
19:10	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
be	1
so	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
marry.	1
	1
19:11	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
men	1
cannot	1
receive	1
this	1
saying,	1
save	1
they	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
given.	1
	1
19:12	1
For	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
born	1
from	1
their	1
mother's	1
womb:	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
eunuchs	1
of	1
men:	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
eunuchs,	1
which	1
have	1
made	1
themselves	1
eunuchs	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven's	1
sake.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
it,	1
let	1
him	1
receive	1
it.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
little	1
children,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
pray:	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not,	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
thence.	1
	1
19:16	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
came	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
good	1
thing	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
enter	1
into	1
life,	1
keep	1
the	1
commandments.	1
	1
19:18	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Which?	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
do	1
no	1
murder,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
19:19	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother:	1
and,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
19:20	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up:	1
what	1
lack	1
I	1
yet?	1
	1
19:21	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
perfect,	1
go	1
and	1
sell	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
19:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
shall	1
hardly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:25	1
When	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
amazed,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
19:26	1
But	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
men	1
this	1
is	1
impossible;	1
but	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
19:27	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
have	1
forsaken	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee;	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
therefore?	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
which	1
have	1
followed	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
regeneration	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
sit	1
upon	1
twelve	1
thrones,	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
forsaken	1
houses,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold,	1
and	1
shall	1
inherit	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
19:30	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first.	1
	1
20:1	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
householder,	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
hire	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
labourers	1
for	1
a	1
penny	1
a	1
day,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
vineyard.	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
saw	1
others	1
standing	1
idle	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
20:4	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them;	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
20:5	1
Again	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
and	1
ninth	1
hour,	1
and	1
did	1
likewise.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
found	1
others	1
standing	1
idle,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
stand	1
ye	1
here	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
idle?	1
	1
20:7	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
hired	1
us.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
right,	1
that	1
shall	1
ye	1
receive.	1
	1
20:8	1
So	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
steward,	1
Call	1
the	1
labourers,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
hire,	1
beginning	1
from	1
the	1
last	1
unto	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
that	1
were	1
hired	1
about	1
the	1
eleventh	1
hour,	1
they	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:10	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
came,	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
more;	1
and	1
they	1
likewise	1
received	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
it,	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
20:12	1
Saying,	1
These	1
last	1
have	1
wrought	1
but	1
one	1
hour,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
made	1
them	1
equal	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
burden	1
and	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
20:13	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Friend,	1
I	1
do	1
thee	1
no	1
wrong:	1
didst	1
not	1
thou	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
penny?	1
	1
20:14	1
Take	1
that	1
thine	1
is,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
unto	1
this	1
last,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
20:15	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
mine	1
own?	1
Is	1
thine	1
eye	1
evil,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
good?	1
	1
20:16	1
So	1
the	1
last	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
last:	1
for	1
many	1
be	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
chosen.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
took	1
the	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
apart	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
20:18	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
20:19	1
And	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
mock,	1
and	1
to	1
scourge,	1
and	1
to	1
crucify	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
20:20	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children	1
with	1
her	1
sons,	1
worshipping	1
him,	1
and	1
desiring	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
that	1
these	1
my	1
two	1
sons	1
may	1
sit,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left,	1
in	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
20:22	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask.	1
Are	1
ye	1
able	1
to	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
drink	1
of,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
are	1
able.	1
	1
20:23	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
drink	1
indeed	1
of	1
my	1
cup,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with:	1
but	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left,	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give,	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
20:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
moved	1
with	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
two	1
brethren.	1
	1
20:25	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
dominion	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
great	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
20:26	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
minister;	1
20:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
chief	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
your	1
servant:	1
20:28	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
20:29	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
20:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
blind	1
men	1
sitting	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace:	1
but	1
they	1
cried	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us,	1
O	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
you?	1
	1
20:33	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
may	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
20:34	1
So	1
Jesus	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
touched	1
their	1
eyes:	1
and	1
immediately	1
their	1
eyes	1
received	1
sight,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Bethphage,	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
then	1
sent	1
Jesus	1
two	1
disciples,	1
21:2	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you,	1
and	1
straightway	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
an	1
ass	1
tied,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
with	1
her:	1
loose	1
them,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
ought	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
them.	1
	1
21:4	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
21:5	1
Tell	1
ye	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh	1
unto	1
thee,	1
meek,	1
and	1
sitting	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
a	1
colt	1
the	1
foal	1
of	1
an	1
ass.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
went,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
commanded	1
them,	1
21:7	1
And	1
brought	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
them	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
him	1
thereon.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
multitude	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way;	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
multitudes	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this?	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
Jesus	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
21:13	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
the	1
blind	1
and	1
the	1
lame	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
he	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
saw	1
the	1
wonderful	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Hosanna	1
to	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David;	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
displeased,	1
21:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
what	1
these	1
say?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yea;	1
have	1
ye	1
never	1
read,	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
babes	1
and	1
sucklings	1
thou	1
hast	1
perfected	1
praise?	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
into	1
Bethany;	1
and	1
he	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
21:18	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
he	1
hungered.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
found	1
nothing	1
thereon,	1
but	1
leaves	1
only,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
Let	1
no	1
fruit	1
grow	1
on	1
thee	1
henceforward	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
presently	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
soon	1
is	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
withered	1
away!	1
	1
21:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
faith,	1
and	1
doubt	1
not,	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
but	1
also	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:22	1
And	1
all	1
things,	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
prayer,	1
believing,	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive.	1
	1
21:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
and	1
said,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
also	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing,	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
tell	1
me,	1
I	1
in	1
like	1
wise	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:25	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
whence	1
was	1
it?	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
us,	1
Why	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
then	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
21:26	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
we	1
fear	1
the	1
people;	1
for	1
all	1
hold	1
John	1
as	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
21:28	1
But	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
said,	1
Son,	1
go	1
work	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
my	1
vineyard.	1
	1
21:29	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
will	1
not:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
repented,	1
and	1
went.	1
	1
21:30	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
said	1
likewise.	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
go,	1
sir:	1
and	1
went	1
not.	1
	1
21:31	1
Whether	1
of	1
them	1
twain	1
did	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
father?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
first.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
you.	1
	1
21:32	1
For	1
John	1
came	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
the	1
harlots	1
believed	1
him:	1
and	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
repented	1
not	1
afterward,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
21:33	1
Hear	1
another	1
parable:	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
householder,	1
which	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
hedged	1
it	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
winepress	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country:	1
21:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
drew	1
near,	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
beat	1
one,	1
and	1
killed	1
another,	1
and	1
stoned	1
another.	1
	1
21:36	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
other	1
servants	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first:	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
unto	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:37	1
But	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
son,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
21:38	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
the	1
son,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
seize	1
on	1
his	1
inheritance.	1
	1
21:39	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
21:40	1
When	1
the	1
lord	1
therefore	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
cometh,	1
what	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
unto	1
those	1
husbandmen?	1
	1
21:41	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
will	1
miserably	1
destroy	1
those	1
wicked	1
men,	1
and	1
will	1
let	1
out	1
his	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
other	1
husbandmen,	1
which	1
shall	1
render	1
him	1
the	1
fruits	1
in	1
their	1
seasons.	1
	1
21:42	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Did	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
21:43	1
Therefore	1
say	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
nation	1
bringing	1
forth	1
the	1
fruits	1
thereof.	1
	1
21:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
on	1
this	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken:	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
21:45	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
his	1
parables,	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:46	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
22:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
again	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said,	1
22:2	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
king,	1
which	1
made	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
22:3	1
And	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden	1
to	1
the	1
wedding:	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
come.	1
	1
22:4	1
Again,	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
other	1
servants,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
bidden,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
prepared	1
my	1
dinner:	1
my	1
oxen	1
and	1
my	1
fatlings	1
are	1
killed,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
ready:	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:5	1
But	1
they	1
made	1
light	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways,	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
farm,	1
another	1
to	1
his	1
merchandise:	1
22:6	1
And	1
the	1
remnant	1
took	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
entreated	1
them	1
spitefully,	1
and	1
slew	1
them.	1
	1
22:7	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
was	1
wroth:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
forth	1
his	1
armies,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
those	1
murderers,	1
and	1
burned	1
up	1
their	1
city.	1
	1
22:8	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
The	1
wedding	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
were	1
not	1
worthy.	1
	1
22:9	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
find,	1
bid	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
22:10	1
So	1
those	1
servants	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways,	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
all	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
they	1
found,	1
both	1
bad	1
and	1
good:	1
and	1
the	1
wedding	1
was	1
furnished	1
with	1
guests.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
king	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
guests,	1
he	1
saw	1
there	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
on	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment:	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
how	1
camest	1
thou	1
in	1
hither	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
wedding	1
garment?	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
speechless.	1
	1
22:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
to	1
the	1
servants,	1
Bind	1
him	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness,	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
22:14	1
For	1
many	1
are	1
called,	1
but	1
few	1
are	1
chosen.	1
	1
22:15	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
entangle	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
talk.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
they	1
sent	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
their	1
disciples	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth,	1
neither	1
carest	1
thou	1
for	1
any	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
22:17	1
Tell	1
us	1
therefore,	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou?	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
22:18	1
But	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me,	1
ye	1
hypocrites?	1
	1
22:19	1
Shew	1
me	1
the	1
tribute	1
money.	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
penny.	1
	1
22:20	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
22:21	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
Caesar's;	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
22:22	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
they	1
marvelled,	1
and	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
22:23	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
22:24	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
said,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
die,	1
having	1
no	1
children,	1
his	1
brother	1
shall	1
marry	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
22:25	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
deceased,	1
and,	1
having	1
no	1
issue,	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
unto	1
his	1
brother:	1
22:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
second	1
also,	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
unto	1
the	1
seventh.	1
	1
22:27	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
22:28	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
seven?	1
	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
her.	1
	1
22:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
do	1
err,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
nor	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:30	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
22:31	1
But	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
by	1
God,	1
saying,	1
22:32	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
multitude	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
22:34	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
to	1
silence,	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
22:35	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
question,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
and	1
saying,	1
22:36	1
Master,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
commandment	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
22:37	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind.	1
	1
22:38	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
great	1
commandment.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
it,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
22:40	1
On	1
these	1
two	1
commandments	1
hang	1
all	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
22:41	1
While	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
them,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
What	1
think	1
ye	1
of	1
Christ?	1
whose	1
son	1
is	1
he?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
22:43	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
then	1
doth	1
David	1
in	1
spirit	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
saying,	1
22:44	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool?	1
	1
22:45	1
If	1
David	1
then	1
call	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
22:46	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
a	1
word,	1
neither	1
durst	1
any	1
man	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
more	1
questions.	1
	1
23:1	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
23:2	1
Saying	1
The	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
sit	1
in	1
Moses'	1
seat:	1
23:3	1
All	1
therefore	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
bid	1
you	1
observe,	1
that	1
observe	1
and	1
do;	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
after	1
their	1
works:	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
and	1
do	1
not.	1
	1
23:4	1
For	1
they	1
bind	1
heavy	1
burdens	1
and	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
men's	1
shoulders;	1
but	1
they	1
themselves	1
will	1
not	1
move	1
them	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
fingers.	1
	1
23:5	1
But	1
all	1
their	1
works	1
they	1
do	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
men:	1
they	1
make	1
broad	1
their	1
phylacteries,	1
and	1
enlarge	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
their	1
garments,	1
23:6	1
And	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
23:7	1
And	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
men,	1
Rabbi,	1
Rabbi.	1
	1
23:8	1
But	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
called	1
Rabbi:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ;	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
call	1
no	1
man	1
your	1
father	1
upon	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Father,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
23:10	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
called	1
masters:	1
for	1
one	1
is	1
your	1
Master,	1
even	1
Christ.	1
	1
23:11	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
servant.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
exalt	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
humble	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
23:13	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
shut	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
against	1
men:	1
for	1
ye	1
neither	1
go	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
neither	1
suffer	1
ye	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
entering	1
to	1
go	1
in.	1
	1
23:14	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayer:	1
therefore	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
23:15	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
compass	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
proselyte,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
made,	1
ye	1
make	1
him	1
twofold	1
more	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
hell	1
than	1
yourselves.	1
	1
23:16	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
say,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
debtor!	1
	1
23:17	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gold,	1
or	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gold?	1
	1
23:18	1
And,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
gift	1
that	1
is	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
is	1
guilty.	1
	1
23:19	1
Ye	1
fools	1
and	1
blind:	1
for	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
the	1
gift,	1
or	1
the	1
altar	1
that	1
sanctifieth	1
the	1
gift?	1
	1
23:20	1
Whoso	1
therefore	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
altar,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
things	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:21	1
And	1
whoso	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
temple,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
therein.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
swear	1
by	1
heaven,	1
sweareth	1
by	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
sitteth	1
thereon.	1
	1
23:23	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
pay	1
tithe	1
of	1
mint	1
and	1
anise	1
and	1
cummin,	1
and	1
have	1
omitted	1
the	1
weightier	1
matters	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
judgment,	1
mercy,	1
and	1
faith:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
23:24	1
Ye	1
blind	1
guides,	1
which	1
strain	1
at	1
a	1
gnat,	1
and	1
swallow	1
a	1
camel.	1
	1
23:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
platter,	1
but	1
within	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
extortion	1
and	1
excess.	1
	1
23:26	1
Thou	1
blind	1
Pharisee,	1
cleanse	1
first	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
platter,	1
that	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
clean	1
also.	1
	1
23:27	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
whited	1
sepulchres,	1
which	1
indeed	1
appear	1
beautiful	1
outward,	1
but	1
are	1
within	1
full	1
of	1
dead	1
men's	1
bones,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
uncleanness.	1
	1
23:28	1
Even	1
so	1
ye	1
also	1
outwardly	1
appear	1
righteous	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
within	1
ye	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
iniquity.	1
	1
23:29	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
because	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
tombs	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
garnish	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
righteous,	1
23:30	1
And	1
say,	1
If	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
partakers	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:31	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
killed	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
23:32	1
Fill	1
ye	1
up	1
then	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
your	1
fathers.	1
	1
23:33	1
Ye	1
serpents,	1
ye	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
how	1
can	1
ye	1
escape	1
the	1
damnation	1
of	1
hell?	1
	1
23:34	1
Wherefore,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
prophets,	1
and	1
wise	1
men,	1
and	1
scribes:	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
ye	1
shall	1
kill	1
and	1
crucify;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
ye	1
scourge	1
in	1
your	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
persecute	1
them	1
from	1
city	1
to	1
city:	1
23:35	1
That	1
upon	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
all	1
the	1
righteous	1
blood	1
shed	1
upon	1
the	1
earth,	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
righteous	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
son	1
of	1
Barachias,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
between	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
altar.	1
	1
23:36	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
23:37	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
thou	1
that	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee,	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
gathereth	1
her	1
chickens	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
23:38	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate.	1
	1
23:39	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me	1
henceforth,	1
till	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
shew	1
him	1
the	1
buildings	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
See	1
ye	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
here	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
privately,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
thy	1
coming,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
you.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:6	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars:	1
see	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
24:7	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences,	1
and	1
earthquakes,	1
in	1
divers	1
places.	1
	1
24:8	1
All	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
24:9	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
afflicted,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
24:10	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
offended,	1
and	1
shall	1
betray	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
shall	1
hate	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
many	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
because	1
iniquity	1
shall	1
abound,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
many	1
shall	1
wax	1
cold.	1
	1
24:13	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
this	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
a	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
nations;	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
end	1
come.	1
	1
24:15	1
When	1
ye	1
therefore	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
place,	1
(whoso	1
readeth,	1
let	1
him	1
understand:)	1
24:16	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
into	1
the	1
mountains:	1
24:17	1
Let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
24:18	1
Neither	1
let	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
return	1
back	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
clothes.	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
24:20	1
But	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
neither	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
24:21	1
For	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
tribulation,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
this	1
time,	1
no,	1
nor	1
ever	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
except	1
those	1
days	1
should	1
be	1
shortened,	1
there	1
should	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
shortened.	1
	1
24:23	1
Then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ,	1
or	1
there;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:24	1
For	1
there	1
shall	1
arise	1
false	1
Christs,	1
and	1
false	1
prophets,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
great	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders;	1
insomuch	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
they	1
shall	1
deceive	1
the	1
very	1
elect.	1
	1
24:25	1
Behold,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before.	1
	1
24:26	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
go	1
not	1
forth:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
secret	1
chambers;	1
believe	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
24:27	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
shineth	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
west;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:28	1
For	1
wheresoever	1
the	1
carcase	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
24:29	1
Immediately	1
after	1
the	1
tribulation	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
the	1
sun	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
shall	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
heavens	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken:	1
24:30	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
appear	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
mourn,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
his	1
angels	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
trumpet,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
24:32	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
his	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
nigh:	1
24:33	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
near,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
24:34	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
24:35	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away,	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
24:36	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
heaven,	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
only.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe	1
were,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:38	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
were	1
before	1
the	1
flood	1
they	1
were	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking,	1
marrying	1
and	1
giving	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
24:39	1
And	1
knew	1
not	1
until	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
took	1
them	1
all	1
away;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be.	1
	1
24:40	1
Then	1
shall	1
two	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:41	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
at	1
the	1
mill;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
24:42	1
Watch	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
hour	1
your	1
Lord	1
doth	1
come.	1
	1
24:43	1
But	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
in	1
what	1
watch	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
up.	1
	1
24:44	1
Therefore	1
be	1
ye	1
also	1
ready:	1
for	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
hour	1
as	1
ye	1
think	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
24:45	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
hath	1
made	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
24:46	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
24:47	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
he	1
shall	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
24:48	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
evil	1
servant	1
shall	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
24:49	1
And	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
smite	1
his	1
fellowservants,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
the	1
drunken;	1
24:50	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware	1
of,	1
24:51	1
And	1
shall	1
cut	1
him	1
asunder,	1
and	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
hypocrites:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:1	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
be	1
likened	1
unto	1
ten	1
virgins,	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
	1
25:2	1
And	1
five	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
wise,	1
and	1
five	1
were	1
foolish.	1
	1
25:3	1
They	1
that	1
were	1
foolish	1
took	1
their	1
lamps,	1
and	1
took	1
no	1
oil	1
with	1
them:	1
25:4	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
took	1
oil	1
in	1
their	1
vessels	1
with	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:5	1
While	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
tarried,	1
they	1
all	1
slumbered	1
and	1
slept.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cry	1
made,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
cometh;	1
go	1
ye	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him.	1
	1
25:7	1
Then	1
all	1
those	1
virgins	1
arose,	1
and	1
trimmed	1
their	1
lamps.	1
	1
25:8	1
And	1
the	1
foolish	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
wise,	1
Give	1
us	1
of	1
your	1
oil;	1
for	1
our	1
lamps	1
are	1
gone	1
out.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
the	1
wise	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
so;	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
us	1
and	1
you:	1
but	1
go	1
ye	1
rather	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sell,	1
and	1
buy	1
for	1
yourselves.	1
	1
25:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
buy,	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
came;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
ready	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
marriage:	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut.	1
	1
25:11	1
Afterward	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
other	1
virgins,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
to	1
us.	1
	1
25:12	1
But	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
25:13	1
Watch	1
therefore,	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
neither	1
the	1
day	1
nor	1
the	1
hour	1
wherein	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh.	1
	1
25:14	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
heaven	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
travelling	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
who	1
called	1
his	1
own	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
25:15	1
And	1
unto	1
one	1
he	1
gave	1
five	1
talents,	1
to	1
another	1
two,	1
and	1
to	1
another	1
one;	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
several	1
ability;	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
his	1
journey.	1
	1
25:16	1
Then	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
five	1
talents	1
went	1
and	1
traded	1
with	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
other	1
five	1
talents.	1
	1
25:17	1
And	1
likewise	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two,	1
he	1
also	1
gained	1
other	1
two.	1
	1
25:18	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
one	1
went	1
and	1
digged	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hid	1
his	1
lord's	1
money.	1
	1
25:19	1
After	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
those	1
servants	1
cometh,	1
and	1
reckoneth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
five	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
brought	1
other	1
five	1
talents,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
five	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
beside	1
them	1
five	1
talents	1
more.	1
	1
25:21	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
thou	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant:	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:22	1
He	1
also	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
two	1
talents	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
deliveredst	1
unto	1
me	1
two	1
talents:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
two	1
other	1
talents	1
beside	1
them.	1
	1
25:23	1
His	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well	1
done,	1
good	1
and	1
faithful	1
servant;	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
things,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
ruler	1
over	1
many	1
things:	1
enter	1
thou	1
into	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
thy	1
lord.	1
	1
25:24	1
Then	1
he	1
which	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
one	1
talent	1
came	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
knew	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
hard	1
man,	1
reaping	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sown,	1
and	1
gathering	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:25	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hid	1
thy	1
talent	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
lo,	1
there	1
thou	1
hast	1
that	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
25:26	1
His	1
lord	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wicked	1
and	1
slothful	1
servant,	1
thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
reap	1
where	1
I	1
sowed	1
not,	1
and	1
gather	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
strawed:	1
25:27	1
Thou	1
oughtest	1
therefore	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
my	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
exchangers,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
received	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury.	1
	1
25:28	1
Take	1
therefore	1
the	1
talent	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
unto	1
him	1
which	1
hath	1
ten	1
talents.	1
	1
25:29	1
For	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
abundance:	1
but	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
25:30	1
And	1
cast	1
ye	1
the	1
unprofitable	1
servant	1
into	1
outer	1
darkness:	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth.	1
	1
25:31	1
When	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
angels	1
with	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
sit	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
glory:	1
25:32	1
And	1
before	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
gathered	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
separate	1
them	1
one	1
from	1
another,	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
divideth	1
his	1
sheep	1
from	1
the	1
goats:	1
25:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
set	1
the	1
sheep	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
but	1
the	1
goats	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
25:34	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
King	1
say	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
Come,	1
ye	1
blessed	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
prepared	1
for	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
25:35	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
drink:	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
in:	1
25:36	1
Naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me:	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
came	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:37	1
Then	1
shall	1
the	1
righteous	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
fed	1
thee?	1
or	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
gave	1
thee	1
drink?	1
	1
25:38	1
When	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
took	1
thee	1
in?	1
or	1
naked,	1
and	1
clothed	1
thee?	1
	1
25:39	1
Or	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:40	1
And	1
the	1
King	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
25:41	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
say	1
also	1
unto	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me,	1
ye	1
cursed,	1
into	1
everlasting	1
fire,	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
his	1
angels:	1
25:42	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
meat:	1
I	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
ye	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
drink:	1
25:43	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not	1
in:	1
naked,	1
and	1
ye	1
clothed	1
me	1
not:	1
sick,	1
and	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
ye	1
visited	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
25:44	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
also	1
answer	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
when	1
saw	1
we	1
thee	1
an	1
hungred,	1
or	1
athirst,	1
or	1
a	1
stranger,	1
or	1
naked,	1
or	1
sick,	1
or	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
minister	1
unto	1
thee?	1
	1
25:45	1
Then	1
shall	1
he	1
answer	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Inasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
these,	1
ye	1
did	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
25:46	1
And	1
these	1
shall	1
go	1
away	1
into	1
everlasting	1
punishment:	1
but	1
the	1
righteous	1
into	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
26:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
26:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
is	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
26:3	1
Then	1
assembled	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
unto	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Caiaphas,	1
26:4	1
And	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
Jesus	1
by	1
subtilty,	1
and	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
26:5	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:6	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
in	1
Bethany,	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
26:7	1
There	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
very	1
precious	1
ointment,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat.	1
	1
26:8	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
had	1
indignation,	1
saying,	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
is	1
this	1
waste?	1
	1
26:9	1
For	1
this	1
ointment	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
much,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
26:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
understood	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
the	1
woman?	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
26:11	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
26:12	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
poured	1
this	1
ointment	1
on	1
my	1
body,	1
she	1
did	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
burial.	1
	1
26:13	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
this,	1
that	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
done,	1
be	1
told	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
26:14	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:15	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
give	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
you?	1
And	1
they	1
covenanted	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
26:16	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
26:17	1
Now	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
26:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
at	1
hand;	1
I	1
will	1
keep	1
the	1
passover	1
at	1
thy	1
house	1
with	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:19	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
did	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
26:20	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
26:21	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
began	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
26:23	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
dippeth	1
his	1
hand	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:24	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
26:25	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said.	1
	1
26:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
eating,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat;	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
26:27	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Drink	1
ye	1
all	1
of	1
it;	1
26:28	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
26:29	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
henceforth	1
of	1
this	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
kingdom.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
26:31	1
Then	1
saith	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
26:32	1
But	1
after	1
I	1
am	1
risen	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:33	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
never	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
26:34	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
26:35	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Though	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
yet	1
will	1
I	1
not	1
deny	1
thee.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
26:36	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Jesus	1
with	1
them	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Gethsemane,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
pray	1
yonder.	1
	1
26:37	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
very	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:38	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful,	1
even	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:39	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
let	1
this	1
cup	1
pass	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
as	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
26:40	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
asleep,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
What,	1
could	1
ye	1
not	1
watch	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
26:41	1
Watch	1
and	1
pray,	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation:	1
the	1
spirit	1
indeed	1
is	1
willing,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
26:42	1
He	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
saying,	1
O	1
my	1
Father,	1
if	1
this	1
cup	1
may	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
from	1
me,	1
except	1
I	1
drink	1
it,	1
thy	1
will	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
26:43	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again:	1
for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy.	1
	1
26:44	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
again,	1
and	1
prayed	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
saying	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
26:45	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
26:46	1
Rise,	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
going:	1
behold,	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
doth	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
26:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
lo,	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
26:48	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
sign,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he:	1
hold	1
him	1
fast.	1
	1
26:49	1
And	1
forthwith	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
26:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
wherefore	1
art	1
thou	1
come?	1
Then	1
came	1
they,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
Jesus	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
26:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
Jesus	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
drew	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
struck	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest's,	1
and	1
smote	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
26:52	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Put	1
up	1
again	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
his	1
place:	1
for	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
take	1
the	1
sword	1
shall	1
perish	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
26:53	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
now	1
pray	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
presently	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
twelve	1
legions	1
of	1
angels?	1
	1
26:54	1
But	1
how	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
scriptures	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
that	1
thus	1
it	1
must	1
be?	1
	1
26:55	1
In	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
I	1
sat	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
ye	1
laid	1
no	1
hold	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
26:56	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
disciples	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
26:57	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
Jesus	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
where	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
assembled.	1
	1
26:58	1
But	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
palace,	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
26:59	1
Now	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council,	1
sought	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
26:60	1
But	1
found	1
none:	1
yea,	1
though	1
many	1
false	1
witnesses	1
came,	1
yet	1
found	1
they	1
none.	1
At	1
the	1
last	1
came	1
two	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
26:61	1
And	1
said,	1
This	1
fellow	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
build	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
26:62	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
arose,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
26:63	1
But	1
Jesus	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
26:64	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
said:	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
26:65	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
spoken	1
blasphemy;	1
what	1
further	1
need	1
have	1
we	1
of	1
witnesses?	1
behold,	1
now	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
his	1
blasphemy.	1
	1
26:66	1
What	1
think	1
ye?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
26:67	1
Then	1
did	1
they	1
spit	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
buffeted	1
him;	1
and	1
others	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
26:68	1
Saying,	1
Prophesy	1
unto	1
us,	1
thou	1
Christ,	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
26:69	1
Now	1
Peter	1
sat	1
without	1
in	1
the	1
palace:	1
and	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
26:70	1
But	1
he	1
denied	1
before	1
them	1
all,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
26:71	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch,	1
another	1
maid	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
This	1
fellow	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:72	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
denied	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
26:73	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
came	1
unto	1
him	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
also	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
thy	1
speech	1
bewrayeth	1
thee.	1
	1
26:74	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
man.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
26:75	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
27:1	1
When	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
come,	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
took	1
counsel	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
27:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
bound	1
him,	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
27:3	1
Then	1
Judas,	1
which	1
had	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
condemned,	1
repented	1
himself,	1
and	1
brought	1
again	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
27:4	1
Saying,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
betrayed	1
the	1
innocent	1
blood.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
us?	1
see	1
thou	1
to	1
that.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
he	1
cast	1
down	1
the	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
hanged	1
himself.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
took	1
the	1
silver	1
pieces,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
treasury,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
counsel,	1
and	1
bought	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
to	1
bury	1
strangers	1
in.	1
	1
27:8	1
Wherefore	1
that	1
field	1
was	1
called,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood,	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
27:9	1
Then	1
was	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
Jeremy	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
thirty	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
valued,	1
whom	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
did	1
value;	1
27:10	1
And	1
gave	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
potter's	1
field,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
appointed	1
me.	1
	1
27:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
governor:	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
sayest.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:13	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Hearest	1
thou	1
not	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
27:14	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
to	1
never	1
a	1
word;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
marvelled	1
greatly.	1
	1
27:15	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
release	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
whom	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
then	1
a	1
notable	1
prisoner,	1
called	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:17	1
Therefore	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
Barabbas,	1
or	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
	1
27:18	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
for	1
envy	1
they	1
had	1
delivered	1
him.	1
	1
27:19	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
his	1
wife	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Have	1
thou	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
just	1
man:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
dream	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
27:20	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
persuaded	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
Barabbas,	1
and	1
destroy	1
Jesus.	1
	1
27:21	1
The	1
governor	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
of	1
the	1
twain	1
will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you?	1
They	1
said,	1
Barabbas.	1
	1
27:22	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
then	1
with	1
Jesus	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ?	1
They	1
all	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:23	1
And	1
the	1
governor	1
said,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
him	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:24	1
When	1
Pilate	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
prevail	1
nothing,	1
but	1
that	1
rather	1
a	1
tumult	1
was	1
made,	1
he	1
took	1
water,	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
innocent	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
this	1
just	1
person:	1
see	1
ye	1
to	1
it.	1
	1
27:25	1
Then	1
answered	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
said,	1
His	1
blood	1
be	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
children.	1
	1
27:26	1
Then	1
released	1
he	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
27:27	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
took	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
common	1
hall,	1
and	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
band	1
of	1
soldiers.	1
	1
27:28	1
And	1
they	1
stripped	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
scarlet	1
robe.	1
	1
27:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
they	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
reed	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand:	1
and	1
they	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
they	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head.	1
	1
27:31	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
robe	1
off	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
raiment	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
27:32	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
Simon	1
by	1
name:	1
him	1
they	1
compelled	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Golgotha,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
27:34	1
They	1
gave	1
him	1
vinegar	1
to	1
drink	1
mingled	1
with	1
gall:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tasted	1
thereof,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
drink.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots:	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
garments	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
vesture	1
did	1
they	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
27:36	1
And	1
sitting	1
down	1
they	1
watched	1
him	1
there;	1
27:37	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
over	1
his	1
head	1
his	1
accusation	1
written,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
JESUS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
27:38	1
Then	1
were	1
there	1
two	1
thieves	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
reviled	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
27:40	1
And	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
27:41	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
elders,	1
said,	1
27:42	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel,	1
let	1
him	1
now	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
believe	1
him.	1
	1
27:43	1
He	1
trusted	1
in	1
God;	1
let	1
him	1
deliver	1
him	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:44	1
The	1
thieves	1
also,	1
which	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
cast	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
his	1
teeth.	1
	1
27:45	1
Now	1
from	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
unto	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
27:46	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eli,	1
Eli,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
27:47	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
calleth	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
27:48	1
And	1
straightway	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
ran,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
spunge,	1
and	1
filled	1
it	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
27:49	1
The	1
rest	1
said,	1
Let	1
be,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
save	1
him.	1
	1
27:50	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
cried	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
27:51	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
quake,	1
and	1
the	1
rocks	1
rent;	1
27:52	1
And	1
the	1
graves	1
were	1
opened;	1
and	1
many	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
slept	1
arose,	1
27:53	1
And	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
graves	1
after	1
his	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
holy	1
city,	1
and	1
appeared	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
27:54	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
watching	1
Jesus,	1
saw	1
the	1
earthquake,	1
and	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done,	1
they	1
feared	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
Truly	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
27:55	1
And	1
many	1
women	1
were	1
there	1
beholding	1
afar	1
off,	1
which	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
ministering	1
unto	1
him:	1
27:56	1
Among	1
which	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Zebedees	1
children.	1
	1
27:57	1
When	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
was	1
Jesus'	1
disciple:	1
27:58	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
commanded	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
27:59	1
And	1
when	1
Joseph	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
body,	1
he	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
clean	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
27:60	1
And	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
new	1
tomb,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
hewn	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
rock:	1
and	1
he	1
rolled	1
a	1
great	1
stone	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
27:61	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary,	1
sitting	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
27:62	1
Now	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
preparation,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
27:63	1
Saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
remember	1
that	1
that	1
deceiver	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
alive,	1
After	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
27:64	1
Command	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
be	1
made	1
sure	1
until	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
lest	1
his	1
disciples	1
come	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
steal	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
He	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
so	1
the	1
last	1
error	1
shall	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
27:65	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
a	1
watch:	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
ye	1
can.	1
	1
27:66	1
So	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
sure,	1
sealing	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
setting	1
a	1
watch.	1
	1
28:1	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
as	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
dawn	1
toward	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
came	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Mary	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
28:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake:	1
for	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
descended	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
rolled	1
back	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
sat	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
28:3	1
His	1
countenance	1
was	1
like	1
lightning,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
white	1
as	1
snow:	1
28:4	1
And	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
keepers	1
did	1
shake,	1
and	1
became	1
as	1
dead	1
men.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
women,	1
Fear	1
not	1
ye:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
seek	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified.	1
	1
28:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
risen,	1
as	1
he	1
said.	1
Come,	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
Lord	1
lay.	1
	1
28:7	1
And	1
go	1
quickly,	1
and	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee;	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him:	1
lo,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
quickly	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
great	1
joy;	1
and	1
did	1
run	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
disciples	1
word.	1
	1
28:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples,	1
behold,	1
Jesus	1
met	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
hail.	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
28:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid:	1
go	1
tell	1
my	1
brethren	1
that	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
me.	1
	1
28:11	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
behold,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
watch	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
shewed	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
counsel,	1
they	1
gave	1
large	1
money	1
unto	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
28:13	1
Saying,	1
Say	1
ye,	1
His	1
disciples	1
came	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
stole	1
him	1
away	1
while	1
we	1
slept.	1
	1
28:14	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
governor's	1
ears,	1
we	1
will	1
persuade	1
him,	1
and	1
secure	1
you.	1
	1
28:15	1
So	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
did	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
taught:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
is	1
commonly	1
reported	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
28:16	1
Then	1
the	1
eleven	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
where	1
Jesus	1
had	1
appointed	1
them.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him:	1
but	1
some	1
doubted.	1
	1
28:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
came	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
All	1
power	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me	1
in	1
heaven	1
and	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
28:19	1
Go	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
teach	1
all	1
nations,	1
baptizing	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
28:20	1
Teaching	1
them	1
to	1
observe	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
commanded	1
you:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you	1
alway,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Mark	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
1:2	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
1:3	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
1:4	1
John	1
did	1
baptize	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
Jordan,	1
confessing	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
John	1
was	1
clothed	1
with	1
camel's	1
hair,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
girdle	1
of	1
a	1
skin	1
about	1
his	1
loins;	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
locusts	1
and	1
wild	1
honey;	1
1:7	1
And	1
preached,	1
saying,	1
There	1
cometh	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
after	1
me,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
stoop	1
down	1
and	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:8	1
I	1
indeed	1
have	1
baptized	1
you	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
came	1
from	1
Nazareth	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized	1
of	1
John	1
in	1
Jordan.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
coming	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Spirit	1
like	1
a	1
dove	1
descending	1
upon	1
him:	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son,	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
pleased.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
spirit	1
driveth	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
days,	1
tempted	1
of	1
Satan;	1
and	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts;	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
1:14	1
Now	1
after	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
prison,	1
Jesus	1
came	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
1:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
The	1
time	1
is	1
fulfilled,	1
and	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
repent	1
ye,	1
and	1
believe	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
1:16	1
Now	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
saw	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother	1
casting	1
a	1
net	1
into	1
the	1
sea:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fishers.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
after	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
to	1
become	1
fishers	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
straightway	1
they	1
forsook	1
their	1
nets,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
thence,	1
he	1
saw	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
his	1
brother,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
mending	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
called	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
their	1
father	1
Zebedee	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
the	1
hired	1
servants,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
Capernaum;	1
and	1
straightway	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
authority,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
their	1
synagogue	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit;	1
and	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
1:24	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art,	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
had	1
torn	1
him,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
1:27	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
questioned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
thing	1
is	1
this?	1
what	1
new	1
doctrine	1
is	1
this?	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
commandeth	1
he	1
even	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
immediately	1
his	1
fame	1
spread	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about	1
Galilee.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
forthwith,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever,	1
and	1
anon	1
they	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up;	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
at	1
even,	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
did	1
set,	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
diseased,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
he	1
healed	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick	1
of	1
divers	1
diseases,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils;	1
and	1
suffered	1
not	1
the	1
devils	1
to	1
speak,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him.	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
rising	1
up	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
before	1
day,	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
solitary	1
place,	1
and	1
there	1
prayed.	1
	1
1:36	1
And	1
Simon	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
followed	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
men	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
towns,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
preach	1
there	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
came	1
I	1
forth.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues	1
throughout	1
all	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
1:40	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
leper	1
to	1
him,	1
beseeching	1
him,	1
and	1
kneeling	1
down	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion,	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
will;	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
cleansed.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
him,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
sent	1
him	1
away;	1
1:44	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
but	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:45	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
much,	1
and	1
to	1
blaze	1
abroad	1
the	1
matter,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
Jesus	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
was	1
without	1
in	1
desert	1
places:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
every	1
quarter.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum	1
after	1
some	1
days;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
noised	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
straightway	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
them,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
about	1
the	1
door:	1
and	1
he	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
bringing	1
one	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
which	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
four.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
they	1
uncovered	1
the	1
roof	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
broken	1
it	1
up,	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
bed	1
wherein	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy	1
lay.	1
	1
2:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Son,	1
thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
2:6	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
sitting	1
there,	1
and	1
reasoning	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
2:7	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
thus	1
speak	1
blasphemies?	1
who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins	1
but	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
immediately	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
in	1
his	1
spirit	1
that	1
they	1
so	1
reasoned	1
within	1
themselves,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
2:9	1
Whether	1
is	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
2:11	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
arose,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
before	1
them	1
all;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
We	1
never	1
saw	1
it	1
on	1
this	1
fashion.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
Levi	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
many	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
sat	1
also	1
together	1
with	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
saw	1
him	1
eat	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
2:17	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
physician,	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick:	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
used	1
to	1
fast:	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
fast,	1
but	1
thy	1
disciples	1
fast	1
not?	1
	1
2:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
cannot	1
fast.	1
	1
2:20	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
2:21	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
seweth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
new	1
cloth	1
on	1
an	1
old	1
garment:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
piece	1
that	1
filled	1
it	1
up	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
old,	1
and	1
the	1
rent	1
is	1
made	1
worse.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles:	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
doth	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
is	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
will	1
be	1
marred:	1
but	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles.	1
	1
2:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
began,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn.	1
	1
2:24	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
why	1
do	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful?	1
	1
2:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
need,	1
and	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
he,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:26	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Abiathar	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
sabbath	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
man,	1
and	1
not	1
man	1
for	1
the	1
sabbath:	1
2:28	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
there	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
withered	1
hand.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Stand	1
forth.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
kill?	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
with	1
anger,	1
being	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
stretched	1
it	1
out:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
3:6	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
straightway	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
Herodians	1
against	1
him,	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him.	1
	1
3:7	1
But	1
Jesus	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
from	1
Galilee	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
from	1
Judaea,	1
3:8	1
And	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
Idumaea,	1
and	1
from	1
beyond	1
Jordan;	1
and	1
they	1
about	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
did,	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
that	1
a	1
small	1
ship	1
should	1
wait	1
on	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
throng	1
him.	1
	1
3:10	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
healed	1
many;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
to	1
touch	1
him,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
had	1
plagues.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
known.	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
goeth	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
calleth	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
would:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
he	1
ordained	1
twelve,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
to	1
preach,	1
3:15	1
And	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
heal	1
sicknesses,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
devils:	1
3:16	1
And	1
Simon	1
he	1
surnamed	1
Peter;	1
3:17	1
And	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James;	1
and	1
he	1
surnamed	1
them	1
Boanerges,	1
which	1
is,	1
The	1
sons	1
of	1
thunder:	1
3:18	1
And	1
Andrew,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
and	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Thaddaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
the	1
Canaanite,	1
3:19	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
betrayed	1
him:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
into	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
cometh	1
together	1
again,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
eat	1
bread.	1
	1
3:21	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
friends	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
beside	1
himself.	1
	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
Beelzebub,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
casteth	1
he	1
out	1
devils.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
parables,	1
How	1
can	1
Satan	1
cast	1
out	1
Satan?	1
	1
3:24	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
kingdom	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
kingdom	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:25	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
house	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
itself,	1
that	1
house	1
cannot	1
stand.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
if	1
Satan	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
himself,	1
and	1
be	1
divided,	1
he	1
cannot	1
stand,	1
but	1
hath	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
3:27	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
strong	1
man's	1
house,	1
and	1
spoil	1
his	1
goods,	1
except	1
he	1
will	1
first	1
bind	1
the	1
strong	1
man;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
spoil	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
3:28	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
All	1
sins	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
unto	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
blasphemies	1
wherewith	1
soever	1
they	1
shall	1
blaspheme:	1
3:29	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
blaspheme	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
never	1
forgiveness,	1
but	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
eternal	1
damnation.	1
	1
3:30	1
Because	1
they	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:31	1
There	1
came	1
then	1
his	1
brethren	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and,	1
standing	1
without,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
calling	1
him.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
without	1
seek	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
3:33	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
my	1
mother,	1
or	1
my	1
brethren?	1
3:34	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
sat	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren!	1
	1
3:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
teach	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
4:2	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
many	1
things	1
by	1
parables,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
4:3	1
Hearken;	1
Behold,	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
sower	1
to	1
sow:	1
4:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
came	1
and	1
devoured	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
on	1
stony	1
ground,	1
where	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
much	1
earth;	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
sprang	1
up,	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
depth	1
of	1
earth:	1
4:6	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
up,	1
it	1
was	1
scorched;	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
root,	1
it	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
choked	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
yielded	1
no	1
fruit.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
did	1
yield	1
fruit	1
that	1
sprang	1
up	1
and	1
increased;	1
and	1
brought	1
forth,	1
some	1
thirty,	1
and	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:10	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
alone,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
twelve	1
asked	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without,	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
done	1
in	1
parables:	1
4:12	1
That	1
seeing	1
they	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive;	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
may	1
hear,	1
and	1
not	1
understand;	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
their	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
forgiven	1
them.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
this	1
parable?	1
and	1
how	1
then	1
will	1
ye	1
know	1
all	1
parables?	1
	1
4:14	1
The	1
sower	1
soweth	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side,	1
where	1
the	1
word	1
is	1
sown;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
Satan	1
cometh	1
immediately,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
sown	1
in	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
likewise	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
stony	1
ground;	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
immediately	1
receive	1
it	1
with	1
gladness;	1
4:17	1
And	1
have	1
no	1
root	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
endure	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
time:	1
afterward,	1
when	1
affliction	1
or	1
persecution	1
ariseth	1
for	1
the	1
word's	1
sake,	1
immediately	1
they	1
are	1
offended.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
among	1
thorns;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
4:19	1
And	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
deceitfulness	1
of	1
riches,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
other	1
things	1
entering	1
in,	1
choke	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
becometh	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
these	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
sown	1
on	1
good	1
ground;	1
such	1
as	1
hear	1
the	1
word,	1
and	1
receive	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
some	1
thirtyfold,	1
some	1
sixty,	1
and	1
some	1
an	1
hundred.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
a	1
candle	1
brought	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
or	1
under	1
a	1
bed?	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick?	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
hid,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
manifested;	1
neither	1
was	1
any	1
thing	1
kept	1
secret,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
4:23	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
ye	1
hear:	1
with	1
what	1
measure	1
ye	1
mete,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you:	1
and	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
more	1
be	1
given.	1
	1
4:25	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
4:26	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
So	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
cast	1
seed	1
into	1
the	1
ground;	1
4:27	1
And	1
should	1
sleep,	1
and	1
rise	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
seed	1
should	1
spring	1
and	1
grow	1
up,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how.	1
	1
4:28	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
fruit	1
of	1
herself;	1
first	1
the	1
blade,	1
then	1
the	1
ear,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
full	1
corn	1
in	1
the	1
ear.	1
	1
4:29	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fruit	1
is	1
brought	1
forth,	1
immediately	1
he	1
putteth	1
in	1
the	1
sickle,	1
because	1
the	1
harvest	1
is	1
come.	1
	1
4:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
we	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
or	1
with	1
what	1
comparison	1
shall	1
we	1
compare	1
it?	1
	1
4:31	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
earth,	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
seeds	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth:	1
4:32	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
sown,	1
it	1
groweth	1
up,	1
and	1
becometh	1
greater	1
than	1
all	1
herbs,	1
and	1
shooteth	1
out	1
great	1
branches;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
may	1
lodge	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
such	1
parables	1
spake	1
he	1
the	1
word	1
unto	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
4:34	1
But	1
without	1
a	1
parable	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone,	1
he	1
expounded	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
pass	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
with	1
him	1
other	1
little	1
ships.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
of	1
wind,	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
beat	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
full.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
asleep	1
on	1
a	1
pillow:	1
and	1
they	1
awake	1
him,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
carest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
perish?	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
Peace,	1
be	1
still.	1
And	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
calm.	1
	1
4:40	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
so	1
fearful?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
faith?	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
they	1
feared	1
exceedingly,	1
and	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
obey	1
him?	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
immediately	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tombs	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
5:3	1
Who	1
had	1
his	1
dwelling	1
among	1
the	1
tombs;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
bind	1
him,	1
no,	1
not	1
with	1
chains:	1
5:4	1
Because	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
often	1
bound	1
with	1
fetters	1
and	1
chains,	1
and	1
the	1
chains	1
had	1
been	1
plucked	1
asunder	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
fetters	1
broken	1
in	1
pieces:	1
neither	1
could	1
any	1
man	1
tame	1
him.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
always,	1
night	1
and	1
day,	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
tombs,	1
crying,	1
and	1
cutting	1
himself	1
with	1
stones.	1
	1
5:6	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
afar	1
off,	1
he	1
ran	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
5:7	1
And	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God?	1
I	1
adjure	1
thee	1
by	1
God,	1
that	1
thou	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
5:8	1
For	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
thou	1
unclean	1
spirit.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
My	1
name	1
is	1
Legion:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
many.	1
	1
5:10	1
And	1
he	1
besought	1
him	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
5:11	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
mountains	1
a	1
great	1
herd	1
of	1
swine	1
feeding.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Send	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
swine,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
forthwith	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
them	1
leave.	1
And	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
(they	1
were	1
about	1
two	1
thousand;)	1
and	1
were	1
choked	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
the	1
swine	1
fled,	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
5:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
see	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
legion,	1
sitting,	1
and	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
befell	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
also	1
concerning	1
the	1
swine.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
pray	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
5:18	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
he	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
possessed	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
suffered	1
him	1
not,	1
but	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
home	1
to	1
thy	1
friends,	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
done	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
hath	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
thee.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
publish	1
in	1
Decapolis	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him:	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
did	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
again	1
by	1
ship	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
much	1
people	1
gathered	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
5:22	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Jairus	1
by	1
name;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
5:23	1
And	1
besought	1
him	1
greatly,	1
saying,	1
My	1
little	1
daughter	1
lieth	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
come	1
and	1
lay	1
thy	1
hands	1
on	1
her,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
healed;	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
5:26	1
And	1
had	1
suffered	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
many	1
physicians,	1
and	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
and	1
was	1
nothing	1
bettered,	1
but	1
rather	1
grew	1
worse,	1
5:27	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
press	1
behind,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
5:28	1
For	1
she	1
said,	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
touch	1
but	1
his	1
clothes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
whole.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
her	1
blood	1
was	1
dried	1
up;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
in	1
her	1
body	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
of	1
that	1
plague.	1
	1
5:30	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
immediately	1
knowing	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
virtue	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
turned	1
him	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
press,	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
my	1
clothes?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest	1
the	1
multitude	1
thronging	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
5:33	1
But	1
the	1
woman	1
fearing	1
and	1
trembling,	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done	1
in	1
her,	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
be	1
whole	1
of	1
thy	1
plague.	1
	1
5:35	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead:	1
why	1
troublest	1
thou	1
the	1
Master	1
any	1
further?	1
	1
5:36	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
spoken,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
only	1
believe.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
tumult,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
wept	1
and	1
wailed	1
greatly.	1
	1
5:39	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
make	1
ye	1
this	1
ado,	1
and	1
weep?	1
the	1
damsel	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
he	1
taketh	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
damsel,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
entereth	1
in	1
where	1
the	1
damsel	1
was	1
lying.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
damsel	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Talitha	1
cumi;	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Damsel,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
arise.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
damsel	1
arose,	1
and	1
walked;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twelve	1
years.	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
astonishment.	1
	1
5:43	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
straitly	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
country;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
many	1
hearing	1
him	1
were	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
From	1
whence	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
what	1
wisdom	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
him,	1
that	1
even	1
such	1
mighty	1
works	1
are	1
wrought	1
by	1
his	1
hands?	1
	1
6:3	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
carpenter,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Joses,	1
and	1
of	1
Juda,	1
and	1
Simon?	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
his	1
sisters	1
here	1
with	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
offended	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
Jesus,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
A	1
prophet	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
honour,	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
kin,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
could	1
there	1
do	1
no	1
mighty	1
work,	1
save	1
that	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
a	1
few	1
sick	1
folk,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
he	1
marvelled	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
unbelief.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
round	1
about	1
the	1
villages,	1
teaching.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
send	1
them	1
forth	1
by	1
two	1
and	1
two;	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
over	1
unclean	1
spirits;	1
6:8	1
And	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
their	1
journey,	1
save	1
a	1
staff	1
only;	1
no	1
scrip,	1
no	1
bread,	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
their	1
purse:	1
6:9	1
But	1
be	1
shod	1
with	1
sandals;	1
and	1
not	1
put	1
on	1
two	1
coats.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
In	1
what	1
place	1
soever	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
there	1
abide	1
till	1
ye	1
depart	1
from	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
nor	1
hear	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
depart	1
thence,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Sodom	1
and	1
Gomorrha	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
preached	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
repent.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
many	1
devils,	1
and	1
anointed	1
with	1
oil	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
king	1
Herod	1
heard	1
of	1
him;	1
(for	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
spread	1
abroad:)	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
therefore	1
mighty	1
works	1
do	1
shew	1
forth	1
themselves	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:15	1
Others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
Elias.	1
And	1
others	1
said,	1
That	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:16	1
But	1
when	1
Herod	1
heard	1
thereof,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
John,	1
whom	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
he	1
is	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
6:17	1
For	1
Herod	1
himself	1
had	1
sent	1
forth	1
and	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
John,	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
in	1
prison	1
for	1
Herodias'	1
sake,	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
married	1
her.	1
	1
6:18	1
For	1
John	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
Herod,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
have	1
thy	1
brother's	1
wife.	1
	1
6:19	1
Therefore	1
Herodias	1
had	1
a	1
quarrel	1
against	1
him,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
him;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not:	1
6:20	1
For	1
Herod	1
feared	1
John,	1
knowing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
just	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
holy,	1
and	1
observed	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
6:21	1
And	1
when	1
a	1
convenient	1
day	1
was	1
come,	1
that	1
Herod	1
on	1
his	1
birthday	1
made	1
a	1
supper	1
to	1
his	1
lords,	1
high	1
captains,	1
and	1
chief	1
estates	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
6:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
Herodias	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
danced,	1
and	1
pleased	1
Herod	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
king	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
damsel,	1
Ask	1
of	1
me	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
6:23	1
And	1
he	1
sware	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whatsoever	1
thou	1
shalt	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee,	1
unto	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom.	1
	1
6:24	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her	1
mother,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
ask?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
The	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
she	1
came	1
in	1
straightway	1
with	1
haste	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
and	1
asked,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
thou	1
give	1
me	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
in	1
a	1
charger	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist.	1
	1
6:26	1
And	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
exceeding	1
sorry;	1
yet	1
for	1
his	1
oath's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
which	1
sat	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
reject	1
her.	1
	1
6:27	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
king	1
sent	1
an	1
executioner,	1
and	1
commanded	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
brought:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
beheaded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
6:28	1
And	1
brought	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
a	1
charger,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
and	1
the	1
damsel	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
mother.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
corpse,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
tomb.	1
	1
6:30	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
gathered	1
themselves	1
together	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
things,	1
both	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
taught.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
apart	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
rest	1
a	1
while:	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
coming	1
and	1
going,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
leisure	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
by	1
ship	1
privately.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
them	1
departing,	1
and	1
many	1
knew	1
him,	1
and	1
ran	1
afoot	1
thither	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
cities,	1
and	1
outwent	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
saw	1
much	1
people,	1
and	1
was	1
moved	1
with	1
compassion	1
toward	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
sheep	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
shepherd:	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them	1
many	1
things.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
now	1
far	1
spent,	1
his	1
disciples	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
desert	1
place,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
far	1
passed:	1
6:36	1
Send	1
them	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
villages,	1
and	1
buy	1
themselves	1
bread:	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:37	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Shall	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:38	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
go	1
and	1
see.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
knew,	1
they	1
say,	1
Five,	1
and	1
two	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
companies	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
grass.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
ranks,	1
by	1
hundreds,	1
and	1
by	1
fifties.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes	1
divided	1
he	1
among	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:43	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
fragments,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
fishes.	1
	1
6:44	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
	1
6:45	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
constrained	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
before	1
unto	1
Bethsaida,	1
while	1
he	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
them	1
away,	1
he	1
departed	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
6:47	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
on	1
the	1
land.	1
	1
6:48	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
toiling	1
in	1
rowing;	1
for	1
the	1
wind	1
was	1
contrary	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
fourth	1
watch	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
cometh	1
unto	1
them,	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
upon	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
supposed	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
spirit,	1
and	1
cried	1
out:	1
6:50	1
For	1
they	1
all	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
troubled.	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
it	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
ship;	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
ceased:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
amazed	1
in	1
themselves	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
and	1
wondered.	1
	1
6:52	1
For	1
they	1
considered	1
not	1
the	1
miracle	1
of	1
the	1
loaves:	1
for	1
their	1
heart	1
was	1
hardened.	1
	1
6:53	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
over,	1
they	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
and	1
drew	1
to	1
the	1
shore.	1
	1
6:54	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
straightway	1
they	1
knew	1
him,	1
6:55	1
And	1
ran	1
through	1
that	1
whole	1
region	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
carry	1
about	1
in	1
beds	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
sick,	1
where	1
they	1
heard	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
6:56	1
And	1
whithersoever	1
he	1
entered,	1
into	1
villages,	1
or	1
cities,	1
or	1
country,	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
sick	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
touch	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
but	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
touched	1
him	1
were	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
came	1
together	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
came	1
from	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
defiled,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
with	1
unwashen,	1
hands,	1
they	1
found	1
fault.	1
	1
7:3	1
For	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Jews,	1
except	1
they	1
wash	1
their	1
hands	1
oft,	1
eat	1
not,	1
holding	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
market,	1
except	1
they	1
wash,	1
they	1
eat	1
not.	1
	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
there	1
be,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
to	1
hold,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
cups,	1
and	1
pots,	1
brasen	1
vessels,	1
and	1
of	1
tables.	1
	1
7:5	1
Then	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
asked	1
him,	1
Why	1
walk	1
not	1
thy	1
disciples	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
but	1
eat	1
bread	1
with	1
unwashen	1
hands?	1
	1
7:6	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Well	1
hath	1
Esaias	1
prophesied	1
of	1
you	1
hypocrites,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
This	1
people	1
honoureth	1
me	1
with	1
their	1
lips,	1
but	1
their	1
heart	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
me.	1
	1
7:7	1
Howbeit	1
in	1
vain	1
do	1
they	1
worship	1
me,	1
teaching	1
for	1
doctrines	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
laying	1
aside	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
hold	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
the	1
washing	1
of	1
pots	1
and	1
cups:	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
ye	1
do.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Full	1
well	1
ye	1
reject	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
keep	1
your	1
own	1
tradition.	1
	1
7:10	1
For	1
Moses	1
said,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother;	1
and,	1
Whoso	1
curseth	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
let	1
him	1
die	1
the	1
death:	1
7:11	1
But	1
ye	1
say,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
mother,	1
It	1
is	1
Corban,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
a	1
gift,	1
by	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
profited	1
by	1
me;	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
free.	1
	1
7:12	1
And	1
ye	1
suffer	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
ought	1
for	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
his	1
mother;	1
7:13	1
Making	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
of	1
none	1
effect	1
through	1
your	1
tradition,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
delivered:	1
and	1
many	1
such	1
like	1
things	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Hearken	1
unto	1
me	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
understand:	1
7:15	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
from	1
without	1
a	1
man,	1
that	1
entering	1
into	1
him	1
can	1
defile	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
those	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
parable.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
so	1
without	1
understanding	1
also?	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
perceive,	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
thing	1
from	1
without	1
entereth	1
into	1
the	1
man,	1
it	1
cannot	1
defile	1
him;	1
7:19	1
Because	1
it	1
entereth	1
not	1
into	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
into	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
goeth	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
draught,	1
purging	1
all	1
meats?	1
	1
7:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
That	1
which	1
cometh	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
defileth	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:21	1
For	1
from	1
within,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
men,	1
proceed	1
evil	1
thoughts,	1
adulteries,	1
fornications,	1
murders,	1
7:22	1
Thefts,	1
covetousness,	1
wickedness,	1
deceit,	1
lasciviousness,	1
an	1
evil	1
eye,	1
blasphemy,	1
pride,	1
foolishness:	1
7:23	1
All	1
these	1
evil	1
things	1
come	1
from	1
within,	1
and	1
defile	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
man	1
know	1
it:	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
hid.	1
	1
7:25	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
whose	1
young	1
daughter	1
had	1
an	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
heard	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
and	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet:	1
7:26	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
a	1
Greek,	1
a	1
Syrophenician	1
by	1
nation;	1
and	1
she	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
cast	1
forth	1
the	1
devil	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Let	1
the	1
children	1
first	1
be	1
filled:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
children's	1
bread,	1
and	1
to	1
cast	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
dogs.	1
	1
7:28	1
And	1
she	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yes,	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
the	1
dogs	1
under	1
the	1
table	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
children's	1
crumbs.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
For	1
this	1
saying	1
go	1
thy	1
way;	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
daughter.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
house,	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
devil	1
gone	1
out,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
bed.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
again,	1
departing	1
from	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
he	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Decapolis.	1
	1
7:32	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
deaf,	1
and	1
had	1
an	1
impediment	1
in	1
his	1
speech;	1
and	1
they	1
beseech	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
aside	1
from	1
the	1
multitude,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
fingers	1
into	1
his	1
ears,	1
and	1
he	1
spit,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
tongue;	1
7:34	1
And	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
sighed,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Ephphatha,	1
that	1
is,	1
Be	1
opened.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
straightway	1
his	1
ears	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
his	1
tongue	1
was	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake	1
plain.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
they	1
published	1
it;	1
7:37	1
And	1
were	1
beyond	1
measure	1
astonished,	1
saying,	1
He	1
hath	1
done	1
all	1
things	1
well:	1
he	1
maketh	1
both	1
the	1
deaf	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
the	1
dumb	1
to	1
speak.	1
	1
8:1	1
In	1
those	1
days	1
the	1
multitude	1
being	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
called	1
his	1
disciples	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
8:2	1
I	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
the	1
multitude,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
three	1
days,	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat:	1
8:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
send	1
them	1
away	1
fasting	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
houses,	1
they	1
will	1
faint	1
by	1
the	1
way:	1
for	1
divers	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
from	1
far.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
answered	1
him,	1
From	1
whence	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
satisfy	1
these	1
men	1
with	1
bread	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
8:5	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
How	1
many	1
loaves	1
have	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground:	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
seven	1
loaves,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
small	1
fishes:	1
and	1
he	1
blessed,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
also	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
filled:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
broken	1
meat	1
that	1
was	1
left	1
seven	1
baskets.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
eaten	1
were	1
about	1
four	1
thousand:	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Dalmanutha.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
forth,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
question	1
with	1
him,	1
seeking	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven,	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
8:12	1
And	1
he	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
in	1
his	1
spirit,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Why	1
doth	1
this	1
generation	1
seek	1
after	1
a	1
sign?	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
8:13	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
them,	1
and	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
ship	1
again	1
departed	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
forgotten	1
to	1
take	1
bread,	1
neither	1
had	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
with	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
loaf.	1
	1
8:15	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
beware	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
Herod.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
bread.	1
	1
8:17	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
it,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
reason	1
ye,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
bread?	1
perceive	1
ye	1
not	1
yet,	1
neither	1
understand?	1
have	1
ye	1
your	1
heart	1
yet	1
hardened?	1
	1
8:18	1
Having	1
eyes,	1
see	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
having	1
ears,	1
hear	1
ye	1
not?	1
and	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
remember?	1
	1
8:19	1
When	1
I	1
brake	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
among	1
five	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Twelve.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
among	1
four	1
thousand,	1
how	1
many	1
baskets	1
full	1
of	1
fragments	1
took	1
ye	1
up?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Seven.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
understand?	1
	1
8:22	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
to	1
Bethsaida;	1
and	1
they	1
bring	1
a	1
blind	1
man	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
touch	1
him.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spit	1
on	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
ought.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
see	1
men	1
as	1
trees,	1
walking.	1
	1
8:25	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
again	1
upon	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
look	1
up:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
restored,	1
and	1
saw	1
every	1
man	1
clearly.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
saying,	1
Neither	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
nor	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
of	1
Caesarea	1
Philippi:	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
do	1
men	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others,	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
And	1
Peter	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
teach	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
that	1
saying	1
openly.	1
And	1
Peter	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
rebuke	1
him.	1
	1
8:33	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
Peter,	1
saying,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
thou	1
savourest	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
be	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
people	1
unto	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
also,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
8:35	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
but	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
8:36	1
For	1
what	1
shall	1
it	1
profit	1
a	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
his	1
own	1
soul?	1
	1
8:37	1
Or	1
what	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
give	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
his	1
soul?	1
	1
8:38	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words	1
in	1
this	1
adulterous	1
and	1
sinful	1
generation;	1
of	1
him	1
also	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
Father	1
with	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stand	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
come	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
after	1
six	1
days	1
Jesus	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain	1
apart	1
by	1
themselves:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
transfigured	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
his	1
raiment	1
became	1
shining,	1
exceeding	1
white	1
as	1
snow;	1
so	1
as	1
no	1
fuller	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
white	1
them.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
Elias	1
with	1
Moses:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias.	1
	1
9:6	1
For	1
he	1
wist	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
cloud	1
that	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
suddenly,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
they	1
saw	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
more,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
only	1
with	1
themselves.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
mountain,	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
had	1
seen,	1
till	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
were	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
that	1
saying	1
with	1
themselves,	1
questioning	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
the	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
should	1
mean.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Elias	1
must	1
first	1
come?	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
Elias	1
verily	1
cometh	1
first,	1
and	1
restoreth	1
all	1
things;	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
Elias	1
is	1
indeed	1
come,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
unto	1
him	1
whatsoever	1
they	1
listed,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
questioning	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
straightway	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
beheld	1
him,	1
were	1
greatly	1
amazed,	1
and	1
running	1
to	1
him	1
saluted	1
him.	1
	1
9:16	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
scribes,	1
What	1
question	1
ye	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
unto	1
thee	1
my	1
son,	1
which	1
hath	1
a	1
dumb	1
spirit;	1
9:18	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
taketh	1
him,	1
he	1
teareth	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
foameth,	1
and	1
gnasheth	1
with	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
pineth	1
away:	1
and	1
I	1
spake	1
to	1
thy	1
disciples	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:19	1
He	1
answereth	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
O	1
faithless	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you?	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
suffer	1
you?	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
straightway	1
the	1
spirit	1
tare	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
wallowed	1
foaming.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
father,	1
How	1
long	1
is	1
it	1
ago	1
since	1
this	1
came	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
child.	1
	1
9:22	1
And	1
ofttimes	1
it	1
hath	1
cast	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
waters,	1
to	1
destroy	1
him:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
do	1
any	1
thing,	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
9:23	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
canst	1
believe,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
9:24	1
And	1
straightway	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
child	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
tears,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe;	1
help	1
thou	1
mine	1
unbelief.	1
	1
9:25	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
running	1
together,	1
he	1
rebuked	1
the	1
foul	1
spirit,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
dumb	1
and	1
deaf	1
spirit,	1
I	1
charge	1
thee,	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
enter	1
no	1
more	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
the	1
spirit	1
cried,	1
and	1
rent	1
him	1
sore,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
one	1
dead;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
many	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Jesus	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
arose.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
we	1
cast	1
him	1
out?	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
kind	1
can	1
come	1
forth	1
by	1
nothing,	1
but	1
by	1
prayer	1
and	1
fasting.	1
	1
9:30	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
know	1
it.	1
	1
9:31	1
For	1
he	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
kill	1
him;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
killed,	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid	1
to	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum:	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
disputed	1
among	1
yourselves	1
by	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
9:34	1
But	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
had	1
disputed	1
among	1
themselves,	1
who	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
first,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
last	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
9:37	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
one	1
of	1
such	1
children	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me,	1
receiveth	1
not	1
me,	1
but	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us:	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
us.	1
	1
9:39	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
which	1
shall	1
do	1
a	1
miracle	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
can	1
lightly	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
9:40	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
on	1
our	1
part.	1
	1
9:41	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
water	1
to	1
drink	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
because	1
ye	1
belong	1
to	1
Christ,	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
lose	1
his	1
reward.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
were	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
hand	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
life	1
maimed,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
hands	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:44	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:45	1
And	1
if	1
thy	1
foot	1
offend	1
thee,	1
cut	1
it	1
off:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
halt	1
into	1
life,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell,	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
never	1
shall	1
be	1
quenched:	1
9:46	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
if	1
thine	1
eye	1
offend	1
thee,	1
pluck	1
it	1
out:	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
eye,	1
than	1
having	1
two	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
into	1
hell	1
fire:	1
9:48	1
Where	1
their	1
worm	1
dieth	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
is	1
not	1
quenched.	1
	1
9:49	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
fire,	1
and	1
every	1
sacrifice	1
shall	1
be	1
salted	1
with	1
salt.	1
	1
9:50	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
saltness,	1
wherewith	1
will	1
ye	1
season	1
it?	1
Have	1
salt	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
have	1
peace	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
	1
10:1	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
from	1
thence,	1
and	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea	1
by	1
the	1
farther	1
side	1
of	1
Jordan:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
resort	1
unto	1
him	1
again;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
he	1
taught	1
them	1
again.	1
	1
10:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife?	1
tempting	1
him.	1
	1
10:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
did	1
Moses	1
command	1
you?	1
10:4	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Moses	1
suffered	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
divorcement,	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
For	1
the	1
hardness	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
he	1
wrote	1
you	1
this	1
precept.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
God	1
made	1
them	1
male	1
and	1
female.	1
	1
10:7	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
cleave	1
to	1
his	1
wife;	1
10:8	1
And	1
they	1
twain	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh:	1
so	1
then	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
twain,	1
but	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
10:9	1
What	1
therefore	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
together,	1
let	1
not	1
man	1
put	1
asunder.	1
	1
10:10	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
matter.	1
	1
10:11	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marry	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
10:12	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
shall	1
put	1
away	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
she	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
young	1
children	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
touch	1
them:	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
rebuked	1
those	1
that	1
brought	1
them.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
displeased,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suffer	1
the	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:15	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
put	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
way,	1
there	1
came	1
one	1
running,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
good	1
but	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
10:19	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Defraud	1
not,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
observed	1
from	1
my	1
youth.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
beholding	1
him	1
loved	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
One	1
thing	1
thou	1
lackest:	1
go	1
thy	1
way,	1
sell	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
cross,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
sad	1
at	1
that	1
saying,	1
and	1
went	1
away	1
grieved:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
possessions.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looked	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
words.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answereth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
how	1
hard	1
is	1
it	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
trust	1
in	1
riches	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
10:25	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
saying	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
looking	1
upon	1
them	1
saith,	1
With	1
men	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
God:	1
for	1
with	1
God	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible.	1
	1
10:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
have	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
10:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
sisters,	1
or	1
father,	1
or	1
mother,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
or	1
lands,	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
and	1
the	1
gospel's,	1
10:30	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
an	1
hundredfold	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
time,	1
houses,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
and	1
mothers,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
lands,	1
with	1
persecutions;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
10:31	1
But	1
many	1
that	1
are	1
first	1
shall	1
be	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
first.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
before	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
amazed;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
followed,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
again	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
should	1
happen	1
unto	1
him,	1
10:33	1
Saying,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
scribes;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
condemn	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
10:34	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
mock	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
shall	1
kill	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
would	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
shall	1
desire.	1
	1
10:36	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
would	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
for	1
you?	1
10:37	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Grant	1
unto	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
sit,	1
one	1
on	1
thy	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
thy	1
left	1
hand,	1
in	1
thy	1
glory.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
ye	1
ask:	1
can	1
ye	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of?	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
with?	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
can.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
indeed	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
of;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
baptized	1
withal	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
baptized:	1
10:40	1
But	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
left	1
hand	1
is	1
not	1
mine	1
to	1
give;	1
but	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prepared.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ten	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
displeased	1
with	1
James	1
and	1
John.	1
	1
10:42	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
accounted	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
ones	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them.	1
	1
10:43	1
But	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
among	1
you:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
among	1
you,	1
shall	1
be	1
your	1
minister:	1
10:44	1
And	1
whosoever	1
of	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
chiefest,	1
shall	1
be	1
servant	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
10:45	1
For	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ministered	1
unto,	1
but	1
to	1
minister,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
life	1
a	1
ransom	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
10:46	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jericho:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Jericho	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people,	1
blind	1
Bartimaeus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Timaeus,	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
highway	1
side	1
begging.	1
	1
10:47	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cry	1
out,	1
and	1
say,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
many	1
charged	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
the	1
more	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
10:49	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
called.	1
And	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
blind	1
man,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort,	1
rise;	1
he	1
calleth	1
thee.	1
	1
10:50	1
And	1
he,	1
casting	1
away	1
his	1
garment,	1
rose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
10:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
The	1
blind	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
10:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
unto	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
11:2	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you:	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ye	1
be	1
entered	1
into	1
it,	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
never	1
man	1
sat;	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him.	1
	1
11:3	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
this?	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
straightway	1
he	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
colt	1
tied	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
without	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
ways	1
met;	1
and	1
they	1
loose	1
him.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
there	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
do	1
ye,	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
even	1
as	1
Jesus	1
had	1
commanded:	1
and	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
colt	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
11:8	1
And	1
many	1
spread	1
their	1
garments	1
in	1
the	1
way:	1
and	1
others	1
cut	1
down	1
branches	1
off	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
strawed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
went	1
before,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
followed,	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Hosanna;	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
11:10	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
David,	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Hosanna	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
11:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
into	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
now	1
the	1
eventide	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
Bethany	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Bethany,	1
he	1
was	1
hungry:	1
11:13	1
And	1
seeing	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
afar	1
off	1
having	1
leaves,	1
he	1
came,	1
if	1
haply	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
any	1
thing	1
thereon:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
it,	1
he	1
found	1
nothing	1
but	1
leaves;	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
figs	1
was	1
not	1
yet.	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
it,	1
No	1
man	1
eat	1
fruit	1
of	1
thee	1
hereafter	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
heard	1
it.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
and	1
bought	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
the	1
moneychangers,	1
and	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves;	1
11:16	1
And	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
carry	1
any	1
vessel	1
through	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer?	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
11:18	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
destroy	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
him,	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
by,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
dried	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
roots.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
Peter	1
calling	1
to	1
remembrance	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
behold,	1
the	1
fig	1
tree	1
which	1
thou	1
cursedst	1
is	1
withered	1
away.	1
	1
11:22	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
faith	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
mountain,	1
Be	1
thou	1
removed,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
doubt	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
but	1
shall	1
believe	1
that	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
saith	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
11:24	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
What	1
things	1
soever	1
ye	1
desire,	1
when	1
ye	1
pray,	1
believe	1
that	1
ye	1
receive	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
them.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
stand	1
praying,	1
forgive,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
ought	1
against	1
any:	1
that	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
may	1
forgive	1
you	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:26	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
forgive,	1
neither	1
will	1
your	1
Father	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven	1
forgive	1
your	1
trespasses.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
they	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
there	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
11:28	1
And	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
By	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
and	1
who	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
one	1
question,	1
and	1
answer	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
11:30	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
answer	1
me.	1
	1
11:31	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
did	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
him?	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
counted	1
John,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
indeed.	1
	1
11:33	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
We	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:1	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
them	1
by	1
parables.	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
set	1
an	1
hedge	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
digged	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
winefat,	1
and	1
built	1
a	1
tower,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
a	1
servant,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
they	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
another	1
servant;	1
and	1
at	1
him	1
they	1
cast	1
stones,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
shamefully	1
handled.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another;	1
and	1
him	1
they	1
killed,	1
and	1
many	1
others;	1
beating	1
some,	1
and	1
killing	1
some.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
yet	1
therefore	1
one	1
son,	1
his	1
wellbeloved,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
also	1
last	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
They	1
will	1
reverence	1
my	1
son.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
those	1
husbandmen	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir;	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
inheritance	1
shall	1
be	1
our's.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
killed	1
him,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard.	1
	1
12:9	1
What	1
shall	1
therefore	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do?	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
unto	1
others.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
this	1
scripture;	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner:	1
12:11	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
Lord's	1
doing,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
marvellous	1
in	1
our	1
eyes?	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
the	1
parable	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
way.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
they	1
send	1
unto	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Herodians,	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
words.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
true,	1
and	1
carest	1
for	1
no	1
man:	1
for	1
thou	1
regardest	1
not	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
truth:	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
not?	1
	1
12:15	1
Shall	1
we	1
give,	1
or	1
shall	1
we	1
not	1
give?	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
hypocrisy,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
penny,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whose	1
is	1
this	1
image	1
and	1
superscription?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
12:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
to	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
God's.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him.	1
	1
12:18	1
Then	1
come	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
say	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
12:19	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
a	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
and	1
leave	1
his	1
wife	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
leave	1
no	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
12:20	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
dying	1
left	1
no	1
seed.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her,	1
and	1
died,	1
neither	1
left	1
he	1
any	1
seed:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
likewise.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her,	1
and	1
left	1
no	1
seed:	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
12:23	1
In	1
the	1
resurrection	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise,	1
whose	1
wife	1
shall	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
them?	1
for	1
the	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
12:24	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
err,	1
because	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
neither	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
12:25	1
For	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage;	1
but	1
are	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
they	1
rise:	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Moses,	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
bush	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob?	1
	1
12:27	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
do	1
greatly	1
err.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
came,	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
them	1
reasoning	1
together,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
answered	1
them	1
well,	1
asked	1
him,	1
Which	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment	1
of	1
all?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
is,	1
Hear,	1
O	1
Israel;	1
The	1
Lord	1
our	1
God	1
is	1
one	1
Lord:	1
12:30	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
commandment.	1
	1
12:31	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
is	1
like,	1
namely	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
commandment	1
greater	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
the	1
scribe	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
the	1
truth:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
God;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
but	1
he:	1
12:33	1
And	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
understanding,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength,	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
his	1
neighbour	1
as	1
himself,	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
whole	1
burnt	1
offerings	1
and	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
12:34	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
answered	1
discreetly,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
after	1
that	1
durst	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question.	1
	1
12:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
while	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
How	1
say	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
David?	1
	1
12:36	1
For	1
David	1
himself	1
said	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
to	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
12:37	1
David	1
therefore	1
himself	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whence	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
And	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
heard	1
him	1
gladly.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
his	1
doctrine,	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
love	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
long	1
clothing,	1
and	1
love	1
salutations	1
in	1
the	1
marketplaces,	1
12:39	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
uppermost	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts:	1
12:40	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
pretence	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
these	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
12:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
treasury,	1
and	1
beheld	1
how	1
the	1
people	1
cast	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
and	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
rich	1
cast	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow,	1
and	1
she	1
threw	1
in	1
two	1
mites,	1
which	1
make	1
a	1
farthing.	1
	1
12:43	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
more	1
in,	1
than	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
treasury:	1
12:44	1
For	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
of	1
their	1
abundance;	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
want	1
did	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
even	1
all	1
her	1
living.	1
	1
13:1	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
see	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
stones	1
and	1
what	1
buildings	1
are	1
here!	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
these	1
great	1
buildings?	1
	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
upon	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives	1
over	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
Andrew	1
asked	1
him	1
privately,	1
13:4	1
Tell	1
us,	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
when	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled?	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
Take	1
heed	1
lest	1
any	1
man	1
deceive	1
you:	1
13:6	1
For	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
shall	1
deceive	1
many.	1
	1
13:7	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
rumours	1
of	1
wars,	1
be	1
ye	1
not	1
troubled:	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
needs	1
be;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
yet.	1
	1
13:8	1
For	1
nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
earthquakes	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
famines	1
and	1
troubles:	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
sorrows.	1
	1
13:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
for	1
they	1
shall	1
deliver	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
councils;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
rulers	1
and	1
kings	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
the	1
gospel	1
must	1
first	1
be	1
published	1
among	1
all	1
nations.	1
	1
13:11	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
lead	1
you,	1
and	1
deliver	1
you	1
up,	1
take	1
no	1
thought	1
beforehand	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak,	1
neither	1
do	1
ye	1
premeditate:	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
hour,	1
that	1
speak	1
ye:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
ye	1
that	1
speak,	1
but	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
13:12	1
Now	1
the	1
brother	1
shall	1
betray	1
the	1
brother	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
the	1
son;	1
and	1
children	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
against	1
their	1
parents,	1
and	1
shall	1
cause	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
endure	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
abomination	1
of	1
desolation,	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
Daniel	1
the	1
prophet,	1
standing	1
where	1
it	1
ought	1
not,	1
(let	1
him	1
that	1
readeth	1
understand,)	1
then	1
let	1
them	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains:	1
13:15	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
housetop	1
not	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
neither	1
enter	1
therein,	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
thing	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
house:	1
13:16	1
And	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
not	1
turn	1
back	1
again	1
for	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
garment.	1
	1
13:17	1
But	1
woe	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
pray	1
ye	1
that	1
your	1
flight	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
winter.	1
	1
13:19	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
shall	1
be	1
affliction,	1
such	1
as	1
was	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
creation	1
which	1
God	1
created	1
unto	1
this	1
time,	1
neither	1
shall	1
be.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shortened	1
those	1
days,	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
be	1
saved:	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
elect's	1
sake,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
chosen,	1
he	1
hath	1
shortened	1
the	1
days.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
then	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
Lo,	1
here	1
is	1
Christ;	1
or,	1
lo,	1
he	1
is	1
there;	1
believe	1
him	1
not:	1
13:22	1
For	1
false	1
Christs	1
and	1
false	1
prophets	1
shall	1
rise,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
to	1
seduce,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
even	1
the	1
elect.	1
	1
13:23	1
But	1
take	1
ye	1
heed:	1
behold,	1
I	1
have	1
foretold	1
you	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:24	1
But	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
after	1
that	1
tribulation,	1
the	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
light,	1
13:25	1
And	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
fall,	1
and	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
13:26	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
and	1
glory.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
he	1
send	1
his	1
angels,	1
and	1
shall	1
gather	1
together	1
his	1
elect	1
from	1
the	1
four	1
winds,	1
from	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
learn	1
a	1
parable	1
of	1
the	1
fig	1
tree;	1
When	1
her	1
branch	1
is	1
yet	1
tender,	1
and	1
putteth	1
forth	1
leaves,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
near:	1
13:29	1
So	1
ye	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nigh,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
doors.	1
	1
13:30	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass,	1
till	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
13:31	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
13:32	1
But	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
and	1
that	1
hour	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
no,	1
not	1
the	1
angels	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
heaven,	1
neither	1
the	1
Son,	1
but	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
13:33	1
Take	1
ye	1
heed,	1
watch	1
and	1
pray:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
is.	1
	1
13:34	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
Man	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
taking	1
a	1
far	1
journey,	1
who	1
left	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
gave	1
authority	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
porter	1
to	1
watch.	1
	1
13:35	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore:	1
for	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
when	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
cometh,	1
at	1
even,	1
or	1
at	1
midnight,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
cockcrowing,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
morning:	1
13:36	1
Lest	1
coming	1
suddenly	1
he	1
find	1
you	1
sleeping.	1
	1
13:37	1
And	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
all,	1
Watch.	1
	1
14:1	1
After	1
two	1
days	1
was	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
craft,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
they	1
said,	1
Not	1
on	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
lest	1
there	1
be	1
an	1
uproar	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
Bethany	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Simon	1
the	1
leper,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard	1
very	1
precious;	1
and	1
she	1
brake	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
poured	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
that	1
had	1
indignation	1
within	1
themselves,	1
and	1
said,	1
Why	1
was	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
the	1
ointment	1
made?	1
	1
14:5	1
For	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
sold	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
And	1
they	1
murmured	1
against	1
her.	1
	1
14:6	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone;	1
why	1
trouble	1
ye	1
her?	1
she	1
hath	1
wrought	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
poor	1
with	1
you	1
always,	1
and	1
whensoever	1
ye	1
will	1
ye	1
may	1
do	1
them	1
good:	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
14:8	1
She	1
hath	1
done	1
what	1
she	1
could:	1
she	1
is	1
come	1
aforehand	1
to	1
anoint	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
burying.	1
	1
14:9	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Wheresoever	1
this	1
gospel	1
shall	1
be	1
preached	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
this	1
also	1
that	1
she	1
hath	1
done	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
14:10	1
And	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
conveniently	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
they	1
killed	1
the	1
passover,	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
eat	1
the	1
passover?	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
he	1
sendeth	1
forth	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
meet	1
you	1
a	1
man	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water:	1
follow	1
him.	1
	1
14:14	1
And	1
wheresoever	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
in,	1
say	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished	1
and	1
prepared:	1
there	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
14:17	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
he	1
cometh	1
with	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
One	1
of	1
you	1
which	1
eateth	1
with	1
me	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
and	1
another	1
said,	1
Is	1
it	1
I?	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
that	1
dippeth	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
dish.	1
	1
14:21	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
indeed	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
of	1
him:	1
but	1
woe	1
to	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
good	1
were	1
it	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
born.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
Jesus	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
drank	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
testament,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
many.	1
	1
14:25	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
drink	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
that	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
new	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:26	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
sung	1
an	1
hymn,	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
All	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
offended	1
because	1
of	1
me	1
this	1
night:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
smite	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
after	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
risen,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
14:29	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Although	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
offended,	1
yet	1
will	1
not	1
I.	1
	1
14:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
That	1
this	1
day,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
night,	1
before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
the	1
more	1
vehemently,	1
If	1
I	1
should	1
die	1
with	1
thee,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
deny	1
thee	1
in	1
any	1
wise.	1
Likewise	1
also	1
said	1
they	1
all.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
was	1
named	1
Gethsemane:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Sit	1
ye	1
here,	1
while	1
I	1
shall	1
pray.	1
	1
14:33	1
And	1
he	1
taketh	1
with	1
him	1
Peter	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
sore	1
amazed,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
heavy;	1
14:34	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
soul	1
is	1
exceeding	1
sorrowful	1
unto	1
death:	1
tarry	1
ye	1
here,	1
and	1
watch.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
forward	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
prayed	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
the	1
hour	1
might	1
pass	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
14:36	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Abba,	1
Father,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
possible	1
unto	1
thee;	1
take	1
away	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
will,	1
but	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt.	1
	1
14:37	1
And	1
he	1
cometh,	1
and	1
findeth	1
them	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
sleepest	1
thou?	1
couldest	1
not	1
thou	1
watch	1
one	1
hour?	1
	1
14:38	1
Watch	1
ye	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
The	1
spirit	1
truly	1
is	1
ready,	1
but	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
weak.	1
	1
14:39	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
spake	1
the	1
same	1
words.	1
	1
14:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
returned,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
asleep	1
again,	1
(for	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
heavy,)	1
neither	1
wist	1
they	1
what	1
to	1
answer	1
him.	1
	1
14:41	1
And	1
he	1
cometh	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sleep	1
on	1
now,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
rest:	1
it	1
is	1
enough,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
behold,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
betrayed	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinners.	1
	1
14:42	1
Rise	1
up,	1
let	1
us	1
go;	1
lo,	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
14:43	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
cometh	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves,	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
elders.	1
	1
14:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
token,	1
saying,	1
Whomsoever	1
I	1
shall	1
kiss,	1
that	1
same	1
is	1
he;	1
take	1
him,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
safely.	1
	1
14:45	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
goeth	1
straightway	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
master;	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
14:46	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him.	1
	1
14:47	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
drew	1
a	1
sword,	1
and	1
smote	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
ear.	1
	1
14:48	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Are	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
with	1
staves	1
to	1
take	1
me?	1
	1
14:49	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
teaching,	1
and	1
ye	1
took	1
me	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
scriptures	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:50	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
forsook	1
him,	1
and	1
fled.	1
	1
14:51	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man,	1
having	1
a	1
linen	1
cloth	1
cast	1
about	1
his	1
naked	1
body;	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
laid	1
hold	1
on	1
him:	1
14:52	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
linen	1
cloth,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
them	1
naked.	1
	1
14:53	1
And	1
they	1
led	1
Jesus	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
assembled	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
the	1
scribes.	1
	1
14:54	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
him	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
14:55	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
council	1
sought	1
for	1
witness	1
against	1
Jesus	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
14:56	1
For	1
many	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
but	1
their	1
witness	1
agreed	1
not	1
together.	1
	1
14:57	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
certain,	1
and	1
bare	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
him,	1
saying,	1
14:58	1
We	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
this	1
temple	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
with	1
hands,	1
and	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
another	1
made	1
without	1
hands.	1
	1
14:59	1
But	1
neither	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
witness	1
agree	1
together.	1
	1
14:60	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
asked	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
which	1
these	1
witness	1
against	1
thee?	1
	1
14:61	1
But	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
Again	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Blessed?	1
	1
14:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
heaven.	1
	1
14:63	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rent	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
saith,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witnesses?	1
	1
14:64	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
blasphemy:	1
what	1
think	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
condemned	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
14:65	1
And	1
some	1
began	1
to	1
spit	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
to	1
buffet	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Prophesy:	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
did	1
strike	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:66	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
beneath	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
maids	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
14:67	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter	1
warming	1
himself,	1
she	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
And	1
thou	1
also	1
wast	1
with	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
14:68	1
But	1
he	1
denied,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
neither	1
understand	1
I	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
porch;	1
and	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
14:69	1
And	1
a	1
maid	1
saw	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
14:70	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
it	1
again.	1
And	1
a	1
little	1
after,	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said	1
again	1
to	1
Peter,	1
Surely	1
thou	1
art	1
one	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Galilaean,	1
and	1
thy	1
speech	1
agreeth	1
thereto.	1
	1
14:71	1
But	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
curse	1
and	1
to	1
swear,	1
saying,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
this	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
speak.	1
	1
14:72	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
And	1
Peter	1
called	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow	1
twice,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
thereon,	1
he	1
wept.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
straightway	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
held	1
a	1
consultation	1
with	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
council,	1
and	1
bound	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
accused	1
him	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
nothing?	1
behold	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
they	1
witness	1
against	1
thee.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
Jesus	1
yet	1
answered	1
nothing;	1
so	1
that	1
Pilate	1
marvelled.	1
	1
15:6	1
Now	1
at	1
that	1
feast	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
one	1
prisoner,	1
whomsoever	1
they	1
desired.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
named	1
Barabbas,	1
which	1
lay	1
bound	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
him,	1
who	1
had	1
committed	1
murder	1
in	1
the	1
insurrection.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
crying	1
aloud	1
began	1
to	1
desire	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:9	1
But	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Will	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:10	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
had	1
delivered	1
him	1
for	1
envy.	1
	1
15:11	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
moved	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
rather	1
release	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
Pilate	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
will	1
ye	1
then	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
him	1
whom	1
ye	1
call	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
again,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:14	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
the	1
more	1
exceedingly,	1
Crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
so	1
Pilate,	1
willing	1
to	1
content	1
the	1
people,	1
released	1
Barabbas	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
delivered	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
scourged	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
called	1
Praetorium;	1
and	1
they	1
call	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
band.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
they	1
clothed	1
him	1
with	1
purple,	1
and	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
15:18	1
And	1
began	1
to	1
salute	1
him,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
	1
15:19	1
And	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
did	1
spit	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
bowing	1
their	1
knees	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
mocked	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
purple	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
own	1
clothes	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
they	1
compel	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
who	1
passed	1
by,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Alexander	1
and	1
Rufus,	1
to	1
bear	1
his	1
cross.	1
	1
15:22	1
And	1
they	1
bring	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
Golgotha,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull.	1
	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink	1
wine	1
mingled	1
with	1
myrrh:	1
but	1
he	1
received	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
15:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
him,	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
garments,	1
casting	1
lots	1
upon	1
them,	1
what	1
every	1
man	1
should	1
take.	1
	1
15:25	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
third	1
hour,	1
and	1
they	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
the	1
superscription	1
of	1
his	1
accusation	1
was	1
written	1
over,	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
with	1
him	1
they	1
crucify	1
two	1
thieves;	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
his	1
left.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
the	1
scripture	1
was	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
transgressors.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
passed	1
by	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Ah,	1
thou	1
that	1
destroyest	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
buildest	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
days,	1
15:30	1
Save	1
thyself,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cross.	1
	1
15:31	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
mocking	1
said	1
among	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
scribes,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
himself	1
he	1
cannot	1
save.	1
	1
15:32	1
Let	1
Christ	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
descend	1
now	1
from	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
and	1
believe.	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
crucified	1
with	1
him	1
reviled	1
him.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
there	1
was	1
darkness	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
land	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
15:34	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Eloi,	1
Eloi,	1
lama	1
sabachthani?	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
My	1
God,	1
my	1
God,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
forsaken	1
me?	1
	1
15:35	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
he	1
calleth	1
Elias.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
one	1
ran	1
and	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
drink,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
alone;	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
Elias	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
down.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
15:38	1
And	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
twain	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
centurion,	1
which	1
stood	1
over	1
against	1
him,	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost,	1
he	1
said,	1
Truly	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
women	1
looking	1
on	1
afar	1
off:	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James	1
the	1
less	1
and	1
of	1
Joses,	1
and	1
Salome;	1
15:41	1
(Who	1
also,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him;)	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
women	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:42	1
And	1
now	1
when	1
the	1
even	1
was	1
come,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
15:43	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
an	1
honourable	1
counsellor,	1
which	1
also	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
came,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
boldly	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
craved	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
15:44	1
And	1
Pilate	1
marvelled	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
dead:	1
and	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
any	1
while	1
dead.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
centurion,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
Joseph.	1
	1
15:46	1
And	1
he	1
bought	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
which	1
was	1
hewn	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
rolled	1
a	1
stone	1
unto	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
15:47	1
And	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Joses	1
beheld	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sabbath	1
was	1
past,	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Salome,	1
had	1
bought	1
sweet	1
spices,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
come	1
and	1
anoint	1
him.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
at	1
the	1
rising	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
shall	1
roll	1
us	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre?	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
looked,	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
stone	1
was	1
rolled	1
away:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
great.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side,	1
clothed	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
white	1
garment;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
affrighted.	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Be	1
not	1
affrighted:	1
Ye	1
seek	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
crucified:	1
he	1
is	1
risen;	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
here:	1
behold	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
16:7	1
But	1
go	1
your	1
way,	1
tell	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
Peter	1
that	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
you	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
there	1
shall	1
ye	1
see	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
quickly,	1
and	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
for	1
they	1
trembled	1
and	1
were	1
amazed:	1
neither	1
said	1
they	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
any	1
man;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
16:9	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
risen	1
early	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
he	1
appeared	1
first	1
to	1
Mary	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
cast	1
seven	1
devils.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
she	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
they	1
mourned	1
and	1
wept.	1
	1
16:11	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
her,	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
16:12	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
appeared	1
in	1
another	1
form	1
unto	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
walked,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
residue:	1
neither	1
believed	1
they	1
them.	1
	1
16:14	1
Afterward	1
he	1
appeared	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
at	1
meat,	1
and	1
upbraided	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
unbelief	1
and	1
hardness	1
of	1
heart,	1
because	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
risen.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
every	1
creature.	1
	1
16:16	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
and	1
is	1
baptized	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
shall	1
be	1
damned.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
these	1
signs	1
shall	1
follow	1
them	1
that	1
believe;	1
In	1
my	1
name	1
shall	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
devils;	1
they	1
shall	1
speak	1
with	1
new	1
tongues;	1
16:18	1
They	1
shall	1
take	1
up	1
serpents;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
drink	1
any	1
deadly	1
thing,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
hurt	1
them;	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
recover.	1
	1
16:19	1
So	1
then	1
after	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
preached	1
every	1
where,	1
the	1
Lord	1
working	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
confirming	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
signs	1
following.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
Luke	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
many	1
have	1
taken	1
in	1
hand	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
in	1
order	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
most	1
surely	1
believed	1
among	1
us,	1
1:2	1
Even	1
as	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
unto	1
us,	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
were	1
eyewitnesses,	1
and	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
word;	1
1:3	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
me	1
also,	1
having	1
had	1
perfect	1
understanding	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first,	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
order,	1
most	1
excellent	1
Theophilus,	1
1:4	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
those	1
things,	1
wherein	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
instructed.	1
	1
1:5	1
THERE	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Herod,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
named	1
Zacharias,	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Abia:	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
daughters	1
of	1
Aaron,	1
and	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:6	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
righteous	1
before	1
God,	1
walking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
commandments	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
blameless.	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
child,	1
because	1
that	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
barren,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
were	1
now	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
while	1
he	1
executed	1
the	1
priest's	1
office	1
before	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
course,	1
1:9	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
priest's	1
office,	1
his	1
lot	1
was	1
to	1
burn	1
incense	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
praying	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:11	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
him	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
incense.	1
	1
1:12	1
And	1
when	1
Zacharias	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled,	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:13	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Zacharias:	1
for	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard;	1
and	1
thy	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
John.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness;	1
and	1
many	1
shall	1
rejoice	1
at	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
1:15	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
shall	1
drink	1
neither	1
wine	1
nor	1
strong	1
drink;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
shall	1
he	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
their	1
God.	1
	1
1:17	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
go	1
before	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
Elias,	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
disobedient	1
to	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
just;	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
a	1
people	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:18	1
And	1
Zacharias	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
Whereby	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
this?	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
man,	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
well	1
stricken	1
in	1
years.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
Gabriel,	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
am	1
sent	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee,	1
and	1
to	1
shew	1
thee	1
these	1
glad	1
tidings.	1
	1
1:20	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
dumb,	1
and	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
speak,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
performed,	1
because	1
thou	1
believest	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
their	1
season.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
waited	1
for	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
	1
1:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
for	1
he	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
remained	1
speechless.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
ministration	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
he	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
his	1
wife	1
Elisabeth	1
conceived,	1
and	1
hid	1
herself	1
five	1
months,	1
saying,	1
1:25	1
Thus	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
dealt	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
wherein	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
me,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
my	1
reproach	1
among	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
the	1
angel	1
Gabriel	1
was	1
sent	1
from	1
God	1
unto	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
named	1
Nazareth,	1
1:27	1
To	1
a	1
virgin	1
espoused	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Joseph,	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
David;	1
and	1
the	1
virgin's	1
name	1
was	1
Mary.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
highly	1
favoured,	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
with	1
thee:	1
blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women.	1
	1
1:29	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
was	1
troubled	1
at	1
his	1
saying,	1
and	1
cast	1
in	1
her	1
mind	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
salutation	1
this	1
should	1
be.	1
	1
1:30	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Mary:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
found	1
favour	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:31	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
conceive	1
in	1
thy	1
womb,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
a	1
son,	1
and	1
shalt	1
call	1
his	1
name	1
JESUS.	1
	1
1:32	1
He	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
David:	1
1:33	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jacob	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
end.	1
	1
1:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Mary	1
unto	1
the	1
angel,	1
How	1
shall	1
this	1
be,	1
seeing	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
a	1
man?	1
	1
1:35	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Highest	1
shall	1
overshadow	1
thee:	1
therefore	1
also	1
that	1
holy	1
thing	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
thee	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:36	1
And,	1
behold,	1
thy	1
cousin	1
Elisabeth,	1
she	1
hath	1
also	1
conceived	1
a	1
son	1
in	1
her	1
old	1
age:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
with	1
her,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
barren.	1
	1
1:37	1
For	1
with	1
God	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
impossible.	1
	1
1:38	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
Behold	1
the	1
handmaid	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
be	1
it	1
unto	1
me	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word.	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
1:39	1
And	1
Mary	1
arose	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
with	1
haste,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Juda;	1
1:40	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Zacharias,	1
and	1
saluted	1
Elisabeth.	1
	1
1:41	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Elisabeth	1
heard	1
the	1
salutation	1
of	1
Mary,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
her	1
womb;	1
and	1
Elisabeth	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
1:42	1
And	1
she	1
spake	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
art	1
thou	1
among	1
women,	1
and	1
blessed	1
is	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
thy	1
womb.	1
	1
1:43	1
And	1
whence	1
is	1
this	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
my	1
Lord	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
me?	1
	1
1:44	1
For,	1
lo,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
salutation	1
sounded	1
in	1
mine	1
ears,	1
the	1
babe	1
leaped	1
in	1
my	1
womb	1
for	1
joy.	1
	1
1:45	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
she	1
that	1
believed:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
performance	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Mary	1
said,	1
My	1
soul	1
doth	1
magnify	1
the	1
Lord,	1
1:47	1
And	1
my	1
spirit	1
hath	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
God	1
my	1
Saviour.	1
	1
1:48	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
regarded	1
the	1
low	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
handmaiden:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
from	1
henceforth	1
all	1
generations	1
shall	1
call	1
me	1
blessed.	1
	1
1:49	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
mighty	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
me	1
great	1
things;	1
and	1
holy	1
is	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
1:50	1
And	1
his	1
mercy	1
is	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
fear	1
him	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
	1
1:51	1
He	1
hath	1
shewed	1
strength	1
with	1
his	1
arm;	1
he	1
hath	1
scattered	1
the	1
proud	1
in	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
their	1
hearts.	1
	1
1:52	1
He	1
hath	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
mighty	1
from	1
their	1
seats,	1
and	1
exalted	1
them	1
of	1
low	1
degree.	1
	1
1:53	1
He	1
hath	1
filled	1
the	1
hungry	1
with	1
good	1
things;	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
empty	1
away.	1
	1
1:54	1
He	1
hath	1
holpen	1
his	1
servant	1
Israel,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
his	1
mercy;	1
1:55	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
1:56	1
And	1
Mary	1
abode	1
with	1
her	1
about	1
three	1
months,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
1:57	1
Now	1
Elisabeth's	1
full	1
time	1
came	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered;	1
and	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
1:58	1
And	1
her	1
neighbours	1
and	1
her	1
cousins	1
heard	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
shewed	1
great	1
mercy	1
upon	1
her;	1
and	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
1:59	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
eighth	1
day	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
circumcise	1
the	1
child;	1
and	1
they	1
called	1
him	1
Zacharias,	1
after	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
1:60	1
And	1
his	1
mother	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Not	1
so;	1
but	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
John.	1
	1
1:61	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
thy	1
kindred	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
by	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
1:62	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
called.	1
	1
1:63	1
And	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
writing	1
table,	1
and	1
wrote,	1
saying,	1
His	1
name	1
is	1
John.	1
And	1
they	1
marvelled	1
all.	1
	1
1:64	1
And	1
his	1
mouth	1
was	1
opened	1
immediately,	1
and	1
his	1
tongue	1
loosed,	1
and	1
he	1
spake,	1
and	1
praised	1
God.	1
	1
1:65	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
were	1
noised	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
hill	1
country	1
of	1
Judaea.	1
	1
1:66	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
them	1
laid	1
them	1
up	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
saying,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
child	1
shall	1
this	1
be!	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
1:67	1
And	1
his	1
father	1
Zacharias	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
prophesied,	1
saying,	1
1:68	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
Lord	1
God	1
of	1
Israel;	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
visited	1
and	1
redeemed	1
his	1
people,	1
1:69	1
And	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
an	1
horn	1
of	1
salvation	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
servant	1
David;	1
1:70	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began:	1
1:71	1
That	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
our	1
enemies,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
hate	1
us;	1
1:72	1
To	1
perform	1
the	1
mercy	1
promised	1
to	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
his	1
holy	1
covenant;	1
1:73	1
The	1
oath	1
which	1
he	1
sware	1
to	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
1:74	1
That	1
he	1
would	1
grant	1
unto	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
being	1
delivered	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
our	1
enemies	1
might	1
serve	1
him	1
without	1
fear,	1
1:75	1
In	1
holiness	1
and	1
righteousness	1
before	1
him,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
life.	1
	1
1:76	1
And	1
thou,	1
child,	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
prophet	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
go	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
prepare	1
his	1
ways;	1
1:77	1
To	1
give	1
knowledge	1
of	1
salvation	1
unto	1
his	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
their	1
sins,	1
1:78	1
Through	1
the	1
tender	1
mercy	1
of	1
our	1
God;	1
whereby	1
the	1
dayspring	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
hath	1
visited	1
us,	1
1:79	1
To	1
give	1
light	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
in	1
darkness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
death,	1
to	1
guide	1
our	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
1:80	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
deserts	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
shewing	1
unto	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
decree	1
from	1
Caesar	1
Augustus	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
be	1
taxed.	1
	1
2:2	1
(And	1
this	1
taxing	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
when	1
Cyrenius	1
was	1
governor	1
of	1
Syria.)	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
all	1
went	1
to	1
be	1
taxed,	1
every	1
one	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
city.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
Joseph	1
also	1
went	1
up	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Bethlehem;	1
(because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
lineage	1
of	1
David:)	1
2:5	1
To	1
be	1
taxed	1
with	1
Mary	1
his	1
espoused	1
wife,	1
being	1
great	1
with	1
child.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
there,	1
the	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
delivered.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
she	1
brought	1
forth	1
her	1
firstborn	1
son,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
him	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
manger;	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
inn.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
shepherds	1
abiding	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
keeping	1
watch	1
over	1
their	1
flock	1
by	1
night.	1
	1
2:9	1
And,	1
lo,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shone	1
round	1
about	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
sore	1
afraid.	1
	1
2:10	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
you	1
good	1
tidings	1
of	1
great	1
joy,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
to	1
all	1
people.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
unto	1
you	1
is	1
born	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
David	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
which	1
is	1
Christ	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
this	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
you;	1
Ye	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
babe	1
wrapped	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes,	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly	1
host	1
praising	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
2:14	1
Glory	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
highest,	1
and	1
on	1
earth	1
peace,	1
good	1
will	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
2:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
the	1
angels	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
from	1
them	1
into	1
heaven,	1
the	1
shepherds	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
go	1
even	1
unto	1
Bethlehem,	1
and	1
see	1
this	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
which	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
2:16	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
haste,	1
and	1
found	1
Mary,	1
and	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
the	1
babe	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
manger.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
it,	1
they	1
made	1
known	1
abroad	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
them	1
concerning	1
this	1
child.	1
	1
2:18	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
wondered	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
shepherds.	1
	1
2:19	1
But	1
Mary	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
pondered	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:20	1
And	1
the	1
shepherds	1
returned,	1
glorifying	1
and	1
praising	1
God	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
seen,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:21	1
And	1
when	1
eight	1
days	1
were	1
accomplished	1
for	1
the	1
circumcising	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
called	1
JESUS,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
named	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
conceived	1
in	1
the	1
womb.	1
	1
2:22	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
her	1
purification	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
were	1
accomplished,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;	1
2:23	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
Every	1
male	1
that	1
openeth	1
the	1
womb	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
holy	1
to	1
the	1
Lord;)	1
2:24	1
And	1
to	1
offer	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
A	1
pair	1
of	1
turtledoves,	1
or	1
two	1
young	1
pigeons.	1
	1
2:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Simeon;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
devout,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
Israel:	1
and	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:26	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
revealed	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
death,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord's	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
parents	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
2:28	1
Then	1
took	1
he	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
blessed	1
God,	1
and	1
said,	1
2:29	1
Lord,	1
now	1
lettest	1
thou	1
thy	1
servant	1
depart	1
in	1
peace,	1
according	1
to	1
thy	1
word:	1
2:30	1
For	1
mine	1
eyes	1
have	1
seen	1
thy	1
salvation,	1
2:31	1
Which	1
thou	1
hast	1
prepared	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
all	1
people;	1
2:32	1
A	1
light	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
thy	1
people	1
Israel.	1
	1
2:33	1
And	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
marvelled	1
at	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
2:34	1
And	1
Simeon	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Mary	1
his	1
mother,	1
Behold,	1
this	1
child	1
is	1
set	1
for	1
the	1
fall	1
and	1
rising	1
again	1
of	1
many	1
in	1
Israel;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
sign	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
spoken	1
against;	1
2:35	1
(Yea,	1
a	1
sword	1
shall	1
pierce	1
through	1
thy	1
own	1
soul	1
also,)	1
that	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
many	1
hearts	1
may	1
be	1
revealed.	1
	1
2:36	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
Anna,	1
a	1
prophetess,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Phanuel,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Aser:	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
age,	1
and	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
an	1
husband	1
seven	1
years	1
from	1
her	1
virginity;	1
2:37	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
of	1
about	1
fourscore	1
and	1
four	1
years,	1
which	1
departed	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
temple,	1
but	1
served	1
God	1
with	1
fastings	1
and	1
prayers	1
night	1
and	1
day.	1
	1
2:38	1
And	1
she	1
coming	1
in	1
that	1
instant	1
gave	1
thanks	1
likewise	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
looked	1
for	1
redemption	1
in	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
performed	1
all	1
things	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
they	1
returned	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
city	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
the	1
child	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
strong	1
in	1
spirit,	1
filled	1
with	1
wisdom:	1
and	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
2:41	1
Now	1
his	1
parents	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
every	1
year	1
at	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
twelve	1
years	1
old,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
days,	1
as	1
they	1
returned,	1
the	1
child	1
Jesus	1
tarried	1
behind	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
Joseph	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
knew	1
not	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:44	1
But	1
they,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
company,	1
went	1
a	1
day's	1
journey;	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
him	1
among	1
their	1
kinsfolk	1
and	1
acquaintance.	1
	1
2:45	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
they	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
seeking	1
him.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
doctors,	1
both	1
hearing	1
them,	1
and	1
asking	1
them	1
questions.	1
	1
2:47	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
understanding	1
and	1
answers.	1
	1
2:48	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
amazed:	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
thus	1
dealt	1
with	1
us?	1
behold,	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
thee	1
sorrowing.	1
	1
2:49	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
sought	1
me?	1
wist	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
about	1
my	1
Father's	1
business?	1
	1
2:50	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
the	1
saying	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
2:51	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
and	1
was	1
subject	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
his	1
mother	1
kept	1
all	1
these	1
sayings	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
	1
2:52	1
And	1
Jesus	1
increased	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
stature,	1
and	1
in	1
favour	1
with	1
God	1
and	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Tiberius	1
Caesar,	1
Pontius	1
Pilate	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Herod	1
being	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Ituraea	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Trachonitis,	1
and	1
Lysanias	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
of	1
Abilene,	1
3:2	1
Annas	1
and	1
Caiaphas	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priests,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came	1
unto	1
John	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
3:3	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
about	1
Jordan,	1
preaching	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins;	1
3:4	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet,	1
saying,	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Prepare	1
ye	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
make	1
his	1
paths	1
straight.	1
	1
3:5	1
Every	1
valley	1
shall	1
be	1
filled,	1
and	1
every	1
mountain	1
and	1
hill	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
low;	1
and	1
the	1
crooked	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
the	1
rough	1
ways	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
smooth;	1
3:6	1
And	1
all	1
flesh	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
multitude	1
that	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
of	1
him,	1
O	1
generation	1
of	1
vipers,	1
who	1
hath	1
warned	1
you	1
to	1
flee	1
from	1
the	1
wrath	1
to	1
come?	1
	1
3:8	1
Bring	1
forth	1
therefore	1
fruits	1
worthy	1
of	1
repentance,	1
and	1
begin	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
yourselves,	1
We	1
have	1
Abraham	1
to	1
our	1
father:	1
for	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
of	1
these	1
stones	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
children	1
unto	1
Abraham.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
now	1
also	1
the	1
axe	1
is	1
laid	1
unto	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
the	1
trees:	1
every	1
tree	1
therefore	1
which	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit	1
is	1
hewn	1
down,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
fire.	1
	1
3:10	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
then?	1
	1
3:11	1
He	1
answereth	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
two	1
coats,	1
let	1
him	1
impart	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
none;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
meat,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
likewise.	1
	1
3:12	1
Then	1
came	1
also	1
publicans	1
to	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Exact	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
appointed	1
you.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
likewise	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
And	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
violence	1
to	1
no	1
man,	1
neither	1
accuse	1
any	1
falsely;	1
and	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
your	1
wages.	1
	1
3:15	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
expectation,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
mused	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
of	1
John,	1
whether	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
Christ,	1
or	1
not;	1
3:16	1
John	1
answered,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them	1
all,	1
I	1
indeed	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
one	1
mightier	1
than	1
I	1
cometh,	1
the	1
latchet	1
of	1
whose	1
shoes	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose:	1
he	1
shall	1
baptize	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
fire:	1
3:17	1
Whose	1
fan	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
throughly	1
purge	1
his	1
floor,	1
and	1
will	1
gather	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
his	1
garner;	1
but	1
the	1
chaff	1
he	1
will	1
burn	1
with	1
fire	1
unquenchable.	1
	1
3:18	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
in	1
his	1
exhortation	1
preached	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:19	1
But	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
being	1
reproved	1
by	1
him	1
for	1
Herodias	1
his	1
brother	1
Philip's	1
wife,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
Herod	1
had	1
done,	1
3:20	1
Added	1
yet	1
this	1
above	1
all,	1
that	1
he	1
shut	1
up	1
John	1
in	1
prison.	1
	1
3:21	1
Now	1
when	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
baptized,	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
also	1
being	1
baptized,	1
and	1
praying,	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
opened,	1
3:22	1
And	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
descended	1
in	1
a	1
bodily	1
shape	1

4:2	1
Being	1
forty	1
days	1
tempted	1
of	1
the	1
devil.	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
he	1
did	1
eat	1
nothing:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
ended,	1
he	1
afterward	1
hungered.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
command	1
this	1
stone	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
bread.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
man	1
shall	1
not	1
live	1
by	1
bread	1
alone,	1
but	1
by	1
every	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
the	1
devil,	1
taking	1
him	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
high	1
mountain,	1
shewed	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
time.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
the	1
devil	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
All	1
this	1
power	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
them:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
delivered	1
unto	1
me;	1
and	1
to	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
it.	1
	1
4:7	1
If	1
thou	1
therefore	1
wilt	1
worship	1
me,	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
thine.	1
	1
4:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
behind	1
me,	1
Satan:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
worship	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God,	1
and	1
him	1
only	1
shalt	1
thou	1
serve.	1
	1
4:9	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
pinnacle	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
cast	1
thyself	1
down	1
from	1
hence:	1
4:10	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
shall	1
give	1
his	1
angels	1
charge	1
over	1
thee,	1
to	1
keep	1
thee:	1
4:11	1
And	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
shall	1
bear	1
thee	1
up,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thou	1
dash	1
thy	1
foot	1
against	1
a	1
stone.	1
	1
4:12	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
tempt	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God.	1
	1
4:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
the	1
temptation,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
Jesus	1
returned	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
into	1
Galilee:	1
and	1
there	1
went	1
out	1
a	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:15	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
their	1
synagogues,	1
being	1
glorified	1
of	1
all.	1
	1
4:16	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Nazareth,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up:	1
and,	1
as	1
his	1
custom	1
was,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
to	1
read.	1
	1
4:17	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
delivered	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
book,	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
4:18	1
The	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
me,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
anointed	1
me	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
brokenhearted,	1
to	1
preach	1
deliverance	1
to	1
the	1
captives,	1
and	1
recovering	1
of	1
sight	1
to	1
the	1
blind,	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
liberty	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
bruised,	1
4:19	1
To	1
preach	1
the	1
acceptable	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:20	1
And	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
minister,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
And	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
were	1
fastened	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:21	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
this	1
scripture	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
your	1
ears.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
all	1
bare	1
him	1
witness,	1
and	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
gracious	1
words	1
which	1
proceeded	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Joseph's	1
son?	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
will	1
surely	1
say	1
unto	1
me	1
this	1
proverb,	1
Physician,	1
heal	1
thyself:	1
whatsoever	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
done	1
in	1
Capernaum,	1
do	1
also	1
here	1
in	1
thy	1
country.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
No	1
prophet	1
is	1
accepted	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:25	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
many	1
widows	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Elias,	1
when	1
the	1
heaven	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
three	1
years	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
when	1
great	1
famine	1
was	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
land;	1
4:26	1
But	1
unto	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
Elias	1
sent,	1
save	1
unto	1
Sarepta,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Sidon,	1
unto	1
a	1
woman	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
widow.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
many	1
lepers	1
were	1
in	1
Israel	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Eliseus	1
the	1
prophet;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
cleansed,	1
saving	1
Naaman	1
the	1
Syrian.	1
	1
4:28	1
And	1
all	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wrath,	1
4:29	1
And	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
thrust	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
brow	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
whereon	1
their	1
city	1
was	1
built,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
cast	1
him	1
down	1
headlong.	1
	1
4:30	1
But	1
he	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
4:31	1
And	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
taught	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
doctrine:	1
for	1
his	1
word	1
was	1
with	1
power.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
an	1
unclean	1
devil,	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
4:34	1
Saying,	1
Let	1
us	1
alone;	1
what	1
have	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
thou	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
art	1
thou	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
us?	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
who	1
thou	1
art;	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
thrown	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
hurt	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
What	1
a	1
word	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
power	1
he	1
commandeth	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
out.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
every	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
4:38	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
Simon's	1
house.	1
	1
And	1
Simon's	1
wife's	1
mother	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
fever;	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
for	1
her.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
he	1
stood	1
over	1
her,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
fever;	1
and	1
it	1
left	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
arose	1
and	1
ministered	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:40	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
setting,	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
had	1
any	1
sick	1
with	1
divers	1
diseases	1
brought	1
them	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
healed	1
them.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
devils	1
also	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many,	1
crying	1
out,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Christ	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
And	1
he	1
rebuking	1
them	1
suffered	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:42	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place:	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
him,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
stayed	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
4:43	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
must	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
other	1
cities	1
also:	1
for	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
sent.	1
	1
4:44	1
And	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
pressed	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
lake	1
of	1
Gennesaret,	1
5:2	1
And	1
saw	1
two	1
ships	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
lake:	1
but	1
the	1
fishermen	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
were	1
washing	1
their	1
nets.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ships,	1
which	1
was	1
Simon's,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
thrust	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
land.	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
5:4	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
speaking,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Launch	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
your	1
nets	1
for	1
a	1
draught.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Simon	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
we	1
have	1
toiled	1
all	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing:	1
nevertheless	1
at	1
thy	1
word	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
net.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
this	1
done,	1
they	1
inclosed	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes:	1
and	1
their	1
net	1
brake.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
they	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
their	1
partners,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
ship,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
and	1
help	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
filled	1
both	1
the	1
ships,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
sink.	1
	1
5:8	1
When	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
knees,	1
saying,	1
Depart	1
from	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sinful	1
man,	1
O	1
Lord.	1
	1
5:9	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
astonished,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken:	1
5:10	1
And	1
so	1
was	1
also	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
which	1
were	1
partners	1
with	1
Simon.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Fear	1
not;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
thou	1
shalt	1
catch	1
men.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
their	1
ships	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
forsook	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
city,	1
behold	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
leprosy:	1
who	1
seeing	1
Jesus	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
thou	1
canst	1
make	1
me	1
clean.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
touched	1
him,	1
saying,	1
I	1
will:	1
be	1
thou	1
clean.	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
leprosy	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
he	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
go,	1
and	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
priest,	1
and	1
offer	1
for	1
thy	1
cleansing,	1
according	1
as	1
Moses	1
commanded,	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more	1
went	1
there	1
a	1
fame	1
abroad	1
of	1
him:	1
and	1
great	1
multitudes	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
by	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
he	1
withdrew	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
5:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
teaching,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
doctors	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
sitting	1
by,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
town	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
present	1
to	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
5:18	1
And,	1
behold,	1
men	1
brought	1
in	1
a	1
bed	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
palsy:	1
and	1
they	1
sought	1
means	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
him	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
5:19	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
by	1
what	1
way	1
they	1
might	1
bring	1
him	1
in	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
they	1
went	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
tiling	1
with	1
his	1
couch	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
before	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
their	1
faith,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
reason,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
speaketh	1
blasphemies?	1
Who	1
can	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
but	1
God	1
alone?	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
perceived	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
reason	1
ye	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
5:23	1
Whether	1
is	1
easier,	1
to	1
say,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee;	1
or	1
to	1
say,	1
Rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:24	1
But	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
power	1
upon	1
earth	1
to	1
forgive	1
sins,	1
(he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy,)	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
couch,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
thine	1
house.	1
	1
5:25	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
that	1
whereon	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
departed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
glorifying	1
God.	1
	1
5:26	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
fear,	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
day.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
after	1
these	1
things	1
he	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
publican,	1
named	1
Levi,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
custom:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
5:28	1
And	1
he	1
left	1
all,	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
5:29	1
And	1
Levi	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
feast	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
of	1
others	1
that	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
5:30	1
But	1
their	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
murmured	1
against	1
his	1
disciples,	1
saying,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners?	1
	1
5:31	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
that	1
are	1
whole	1
need	1
not	1
a	1
physician;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
sick.	1
	1
5:32	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
righteous,	1
but	1
sinners	1
to	1
repentance.	1
	1
5:33	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
do	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
fast	1
often,	1
and	1
make	1
prayers,	1
and	1
likewise	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees;	1
but	1
thine	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
5:34	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
ye	1
make	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
bridechamber	1
fast,	1
while	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
with	1
them?	1
5:35	1
But	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
fast	1
in	1
those	1
days.	1
	1
5:36	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
also	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them;	1
No	1
man	1
putteth	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
garment	1
upon	1
an	1
old;	1
if	1
otherwise,	1
then	1
both	1
the	1
new	1
maketh	1
a	1
rent,	1
and	1
the	1
piece	1
that	1
was	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
agreeth	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
old.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
putteth	1
new	1
wine	1
into	1
old	1
bottles;	1
else	1
the	1
new	1
wine	1
will	1
burst	1
the	1
bottles,	1
and	1
be	1
spilled,	1
and	1
the	1
bottles	1
shall	1
perish.	1
	1
5:38	1
But	1
new	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
new	1
bottles;	1
and	1
both	1
are	1
preserved.	1
	1
5:39	1
No	1
man	1
also	1
having	1
drunk	1
old	1
wine	1
straightway	1
desireth	1
new:	1
for	1
he	1
saith,	1
The	1
old	1
is	1
better.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
second	1
sabbath	1
after	1
the	1
first,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
corn	1
fields;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
plucked	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
corn,	1
and	1
did	1
eat,	1
rubbing	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days?	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
them	1
said,	1
Have	1
ye	1
not	1
read	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this,	1
what	1
David	1
did,	1
when	1
himself	1
was	1
an	1
hungred,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
6:4	1
How	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
did	1
take	1
and	1
eat	1
the	1
shewbread,	1
and	1
gave	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him;	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
to	1
eat	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
priests	1
alone?	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
That	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
Lord	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
also	1
on	1
another	1
sabbath,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
and	1
taught:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
right	1
hand	1
was	1
withered.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
watched	1
him,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day;	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
find	1
an	1
accusation	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
6:8	1
But	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
withered	1
hand,	1
Rise	1
up,	1
and	1
stand	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
stood	1
forth.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
days	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
or	1
to	1
do	1
evil?	1
to	1
save	1
life,	1
or	1
to	1
destroy	1
it?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
looking	1
round	1
about	1
upon	1
them	1
all,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
man,	1
Stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hand.	1
And	1
he	1
did	1
so:	1
and	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
restored	1
whole	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
madness;	1
and	1
communed	1
one	1
with	1
another	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
continued	1
all	1
night	1
in	1
prayer	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
6:13	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
chose	1
twelve,	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
named	1
apostles;	1
6:14	1
Simon,	1
(whom	1
he	1
also	1
named	1
Peter,)	1
and	1
Andrew	1
his	1
brother,	1
James	1
and	1
John,	1
Philip	1
and	1
Bartholomew,	1
6:15	1
Matthew	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
called	1
Zelotes,	1
6:16	1
And	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
which	1
also	1
was	1
the	1
traitor.	1
	1
6:17	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
coast	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
their	1
diseases;	1
6:18	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
6:19	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
sought	1
to	1
touch	1
him:	1
for	1
there	1
went	1
virtue	1
out	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
6:20	1
And	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
ye	1
poor:	1
for	1
yours	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:21	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
hunger	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
filled.	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye	1
that	1
weep	1
now:	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
laugh.	1
	1
6:22	1
Blessed	1
are	1
ye,	1
when	1
men	1
shall	1
hate	1
you,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
shall	1
separate	1
you	1
from	1
their	1
company,	1
and	1
shall	1
reproach	1
you,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
your	1
name	1
as	1
evil,	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man's	1
sake.	1
	1
6:23	1
Rejoice	1
ye	1
in	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
leap	1
for	1
joy:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
your	1
reward	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
heaven:	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
like	1
manner	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
unto	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:24	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
rich!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
your	1
consolation.	1
	1
6:25	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
full!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
hunger.	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
laugh	1
now!	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
mourn	1
and	1
weep.	1
	1
6:26	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
when	1
all	1
men	1
shall	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
you!	1
for	1
so	1
did	1
their	1
fathers	1
to	1
the	1
false	1
prophets.	1
	1
6:27	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
which	1
hear,	1
Love	1
your	1
enemies,	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
hate	1
you,	1
6:28	1
Bless	1
them	1
that	1
curse	1
you,	1
and	1
pray	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
despitefully	1
use	1
you.	1
	1
6:29	1
And	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
smiteth	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
cheek	1
offer	1
also	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
cloak	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
thy	1
coat	1
also.	1
	1
6:30	1
Give	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
asketh	1
of	1
thee;	1
and	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
taketh	1
away	1
thy	1
goods	1
ask	1
them	1
not	1
again.	1
	1
6:31	1
And	1
as	1
ye	1
would	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
you,	1
do	1
ye	1
also	1
to	1
them	1
likewise.	1
	1
6:32	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
love	1
them	1
which	1
love	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
love	1
those	1
that	1
love	1
them.	1
	1
6:33	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
do	1
even	1
the	1
same.	1
	1
6:34	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
lend	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
hope	1
to	1
receive,	1
what	1
thank	1
have	1
ye?	1
for	1
sinners	1
also	1
lend	1
to	1
sinners,	1
to	1
receive	1
as	1
much	1
again.	1
	1
6:35	1
But	1
love	1
ye	1
your	1
enemies,	1
and	1
do	1
good,	1
and	1
lend,	1
hoping	1
for	1
nothing	1
again;	1
and	1
your	1
reward	1
shall	1
be	1
great,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
Highest:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
kind	1
unto	1
the	1
unthankful	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
6:36	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
merciful,	1
as	1
your	1
Father	1
also	1
is	1
merciful.	1
	1
6:37	1
Judge	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
judged:	1
condemn	1
not,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
condemned:	1
forgive,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven:	1
6:38	1
Give,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
unto	1
you;	1
good	1
measure,	1
pressed	1
down,	1
and	1
shaken	1
together,	1
and	1
running	1
over,	1
shall	1
men	1
give	1
into	1
your	1
bosom.	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
measure	1
that	1
ye	1
mete	1
withal	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
measured	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
Can	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind?	1
shall	1
they	1
not	1
both	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ditch?	1
	1
6:40	1
The	1
disciple	1
is	1
not	1
above	1
his	1
master:	1
but	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
perfect	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
his	1
master.	1
	1
6:41	1
And	1
why	1
beholdest	1
thou	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye,	1
but	1
perceivest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
	1
6:42	1
Either	1
how	1
canst	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
thy	1
brother,	1
Brother,	1
let	1
me	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
eye,	1
when	1
thou	1
thyself	1
beholdest	1
not	1
the	1
beam	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
eye?	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
cast	1
out	1
first	1
the	1
beam	1
out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
eye,	1
and	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
clearly	1
to	1
pull	1
out	1
the	1
mote	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thy	1
brother's	1
eye.	1
	1
6:43	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
tree	1
bringeth	1
not	1
forth	1
corrupt	1
fruit;	1
neither	1
doth	1
a	1
corrupt	1
tree	1
bring	1
forth	1
good	1
fruit.	1
	1
6:44	1
For	1
every	1
tree	1
is	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
fruit.	1
For	1
of	1
thorns	1
men	1
do	1
not	1
gather	1
figs,	1
nor	1
of	1
a	1
bramble	1
bush	1
gather	1
they	1
grapes.	1
	1
6:45	1
A	1
good	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
and	1
an	1
evil	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil:	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
his	1
mouth	1
speaketh.	1
	1
6:46	1
And	1
why	1
call	1
ye	1
me,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
say?	1
	1
6:47	1
Whosoever	1
cometh	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
heareth	1
my	1
sayings,	1
and	1
doeth	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
like:	1
6:48	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
built	1
an	1
house,	1
and	1
digged	1
deep,	1
and	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
a	1
rock:	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
flood	1
arose,	1
the	1
stream	1
beat	1
vehemently	1
upon	1
that	1
house,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
it:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
rock.	1
	1
6:49	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
heareth,	1
and	1
doeth	1
not,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
without	1
a	1
foundation	1
built	1
an	1
house	1
upon	1
the	1
earth;	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
stream	1
did	1
beat	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
immediately	1
it	1
fell;	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
was	1
great.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
ended	1
all	1
his	1
sayings	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
centurion's	1
servant,	1
who	1
was	1
dear	1
unto	1
him,	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
7:3	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
beseeching	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
servant.	1
	1
7:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
instantly,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
worthy	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
this:	1
7:5	1
For	1
he	1
loveth	1
our	1
nation,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
us	1
a	1
synagogue.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
the	1
centurion	1
sent	1
friends	1
to	1
him,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
trouble	1
not	1
thyself:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
enter	1
under	1
my	1
roof:	1
7:7	1
Wherefore	1
neither	1
thought	1
I	1
myself	1
worthy	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
but	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
my	1
servant	1
shall	1
be	1
healed.	1
	1
7:8	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
set	1
under	1
authority,	1
having	1
under	1
me	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
one,	1
Go,	1
and	1
he	1
goeth;	1
and	1
to	1
another,	1
Come,	1
and	1
he	1
cometh;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
servant,	1
Do	1
this,	1
and	1
he	1
doeth	1
it.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
about,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
followed	1
him,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
so	1
great	1
faith,	1
no,	1
not	1
in	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent,	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
found	1
the	1
servant	1
whole	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sick.	1
	1
7:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Nain;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
much	1
people.	1
	1
7:12	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
carried	1
out,	1
the	1
only	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
with	1
her.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Lord	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Weep	1
not.	1
	1
7:14	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
bier:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
bare	1
him	1
stood	1
still.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Young	1
man,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Arise.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
sat	1
up,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak.	1
And	1
he	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
mother.	1
	1
7:16	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
fear	1
on	1
all:	1
and	1
they	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
That	1
a	1
great	1
prophet	1
is	1
risen	1
up	1
among	1
us;	1
and,	1
That	1
God	1
hath	1
visited	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
7:17	1
And	1
this	1
rumour	1
of	1
him	1
went	1
forth	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region	1
round	1
about.	1
	1
7:18	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
John	1
shewed	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
7:19	1
And	1
John	1
calling	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
7:20	1
When	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
said,	1
John	1
Baptist	1
hath	1
sent	1
us	1
unto	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
he	1
that	1
should	1
come?	1
or	1
look	1
we	1
for	1
another?	1
	1
7:21	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
hour	1
he	1
cured	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
infirmities	1
and	1
plagues,	1
and	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits;	1
and	1
unto	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
blind	1
he	1
gave	1
sight.	1
	1
7:22	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
your	1
way,	1
and	1
tell	1
John	1
what	1
things	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard;	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
blind	1
see,	1
the	1
lame	1
walk,	1
the	1
lepers	1
are	1
cleansed,	1
the	1
deaf	1
hear,	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
to	1
the	1
poor	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
preached.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
blessed	1
is	1
he,	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
offended	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
messengers	1
of	1
John	1
were	1
departed,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
John,	1
What	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
	1
A	1
reed	1
shaken	1
with	1
the	1
wind?	1
	1
7:25	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
man	1
clothed	1
in	1
soft	1
raiment?	1
	1
Behold,	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
gorgeously	1
apparelled,	1
and	1
live	1
delicately,	1
are	1
in	1
kings'	1
courts.	1
	1
7:26	1
But	1
what	1
went	1
ye	1
out	1
for	1
to	1
see?	1
A	1
prophet?	1
Yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:27	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
send	1
my	1
messenger	1
before	1
thy	1
face,	1
which	1
shall	1
prepare	1
thy	1
way	1
before	1
thee.	1
	1
7:28	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Among	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
of	1
women	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
greater	1
prophet	1
than	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
he.	1
	1
7:29	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
publicans,	1
justified	1
God,	1
being	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
7:30	1
But	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
lawyers	1
rejected	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God	1
against	1
themselves,	1
being	1
not	1
baptized	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation?	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
like?	1
	1
7:32	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
unto	1
children	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
marketplace,	1
and	1
calling	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
saying,	1
We	1
have	1
piped	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
danced;	1
we	1
have	1
mourned	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
wept.	1
	1
7:33	1
For	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist	1
came	1
neither	1
eating	1
bread	1
nor	1
drinking	1
wine;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
7:34	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
Behold	1
a	1
gluttonous	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
winebibber,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners!	1
7:35	1
But	1
wisdom	1
is	1
justified	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children.	1
	1
7:36	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
desired	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
eat	1
with	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
7:37	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
sinner,	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Jesus	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
Pharisee's	1
house,	1
brought	1
an	1
alabaster	1
box	1
of	1
ointment,	1
7:38	1
And	1
stood	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
behind	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
did	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
anointed	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:39	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
which	1
had	1
bidden	1
him	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
spake	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
prophet,	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
woman	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
toucheth	1
him:	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
7:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Simon,	1
I	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
Master,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
7:41	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
creditor	1
which	1
had	1
two	1
debtors:	1
the	1
one	1
owed	1
five	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
fifty.	1
	1
7:42	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
pay,	1
he	1
frankly	1
forgave	1
them	1
both.	1
Tell	1
me	1
therefore,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
love	1
him	1
most?	1
	1
7:43	1
Simon	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
he,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
forgave	1
most.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
rightly	1
judged.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Simon,	1
Seest	1
thou	1
this	1
woman?	1
I	1
entered	1
into	1
thine	1
house,	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
water	1
for	1
my	1
feet:	1
but	1
she	1
hath	1
washed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
wiped	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
head.	1
	1
7:45	1
Thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
no	1
kiss:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
since	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
hath	1
not	1
ceased	1
to	1
kiss	1
my	1
feet.	1
	1
7:46	1
My	1
head	1
with	1
oil	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
anoint:	1
but	1
this	1
woman	1
hath	1
anointed	1
my	1
feet	1
with	1
ointment.	1
	1
7:47	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Her	1
sins,	1
which	1
are	1
many,	1
are	1
forgiven;	1
for	1
she	1
loved	1
much:	1
but	1
to	1
whom	1
little	1
is	1
forgiven,	1
the	1
same	1
loveth	1
little.	1
	1
7:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
sins	1
are	1
forgiven.	1
	1
7:49	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
within	1
themselves,	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
forgiveth	1
sins	1
also?	1
	1
7:50	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
Thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
afterward,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
throughout	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
village,	1
preaching	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
8:2	1
And	1
certain	1
women,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
healed	1
of	1
evil	1
spirits	1
and	1
infirmities,	1
Mary	1
called	1
Magdalene,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
went	1
seven	1
devils,	1
8:3	1
And	1
Joanna	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Chuza	1
Herod's	1
steward,	1
and	1
Susanna,	1
and	1
many	1
others,	1
which	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
substance.	1
	1
8:4	1
And	1
when	1
much	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
city,	1
he	1
spake	1
by	1
a	1
parable:	1
8:5	1
A	1
sower	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
sow	1
his	1
seed:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
sowed,	1
some	1
fell	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
trodden	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
devoured	1
it.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
upon	1
a	1
rock;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
sprung	1
up,	1
it	1
withered	1
away,	1
because	1
it	1
lacked	1
moisture.	1
	1
8:7	1
And	1
some	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns;	1
and	1
the	1
thorns	1
sprang	1
up	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
choked	1
it.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
other	1
fell	1
on	1
good	1
ground,	1
and	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
bare	1
fruit	1
an	1
hundredfold.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
cried,	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
might	1
this	1
parable	1
be?	1
8:10	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Unto	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
to	1
others	1
in	1
parables;	1
that	1
seeing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
hearing	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
understand.	1
	1
8:11	1
Now	1
the	1
parable	1
is	1
this:	1
The	1
seed	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:12	1
Those	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear;	1
then	1
cometh	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
word	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
and	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
8:13	1
They	1
on	1
the	1
rock	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
hear,	1
receive	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
joy;	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
no	1
root,	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
believe,	1
and	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
temptation	1
fall	1
away.	1
	1
8:14	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
fell	1
among	1
thorns	1
are	1
they,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
heard,	1
go	1
forth,	1
and	1
are	1
choked	1
with	1
cares	1
and	1
riches	1
and	1
pleasures	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
bring	1
no	1
fruit	1
to	1
perfection.	1
	1
8:15	1
But	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
ground	1
are	1
they,	1
which	1
in	1
an	1
honest	1
and	1
good	1
heart,	1
having	1
heard	1
the	1
word,	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
with	1
patience.	1
	1
8:16	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
covereth	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
vessel,	1
or	1
putteth	1
it	1
under	1
a	1
bed;	1
but	1
setteth	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
enter	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
8:17	1
For	1
nothing	1
is	1
secret,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
manifest;	1
neither	1
any	1
thing	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
come	1
abroad.	1
	1
8:18	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
how	1
ye	1
hear:	1
for	1
whosoever	1
hath,	1
to	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
hath	1
not,	1
from	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
even	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seemeth	1
to	1
have.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
press.	1
	1
8:20	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
him	1
by	1
certain	1
which	1
said,	1
Thy	1
mother	1
and	1
thy	1
brethren	1
stand	1
without,	1
desiring	1
to	1
see	1
thee.	1
	1
8:21	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
mother	1
and	1
my	1
brethren	1
are	1
these	1
which	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
8:22	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
day,	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
over	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
lake.	1
And	1
they	1
launched	1
forth.	1
	1
8:23	1
But	1
as	1
they	1
sailed	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep:	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
storm	1
of	1
wind	1
on	1
the	1
lake;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
water,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
jeopardy.	1
	1
8:24	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
awoke	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
master,	1
we	1
perish.	1
Then	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
the	1
raging	1
of	1
the	1
water:	1
and	1
they	1
ceased,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
calm.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
faith?	1
And	1
they	1
being	1
afraid	1
wondered,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
this!	1
for	1
he	1
commandeth	1
even	1
the	1
winds	1
and	1
water,	1
and	1
they	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes,	1
which	1
is	1
over	1
against	1
Galilee.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
land,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
devils	1
long	1
time,	1
and	1
ware	1
no	1
clothes,	1
neither	1
abode	1
in	1
any	1
house,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
tombs.	1
	1
8:28	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
said,	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
most	1
high?	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
torment	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:29	1
(For	1
he	1
had	1
commanded	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
For	1
oftentimes	1
it	1
had	1
caught	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
kept	1
bound	1
with	1
chains	1
and	1
in	1
fetters;	1
and	1
he	1
brake	1
the	1
bands,	1
and	1
was	1
driven	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness.)	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
name?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Legion:	1
because	1
many	1
devils	1
were	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
deep.	1
	1
8:32	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
there	1
an	1
herd	1
of	1
many	1
swine	1
feeding	1
on	1
the	1
mountain:	1
and	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
them.	1
And	1
he	1
suffered	1
them.	1
	1
8:33	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
devils	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
swine:	1
and	1
the	1
herd	1
ran	1
violently	1
down	1
a	1
steep	1
place	1
into	1
the	1
lake,	1
and	1
were	1
choked.	1
	1
8:34	1
When	1
they	1
that	1
fed	1
them	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
they	1
fled,	1
and	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
done;	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
man,	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed,	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
clothed,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
8:36	1
They	1
also	1
which	1
saw	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
devils	1
was	1
healed.	1
	1
8:37	1
Then	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Gadarenes	1
round	1
about	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
with	1
great	1
fear:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
returned	1
back	1
again.	1
	1
8:38	1
Now	1
the	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
departed	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
with	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
sent	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
8:39	1
Return	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
shew	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
God	1
hath	1
done	1
unto	1
thee.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
published	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
8:40	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
returned,	1
the	1
people	1
gladly	1
received	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
8:41	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Jairus,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
house:	1
8:42	1
For	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
only	1
daughter,	1
about	1
twelve	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
a	1
dying.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
the	1
people	1
thronged	1
him.	1
	1
8:43	1
And	1
a	1
woman	1
having	1
an	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
twelve	1
years,	1
which	1
had	1
spent	1
all	1
her	1
living	1
upon	1
physicians,	1
neither	1
could	1
be	1
healed	1
of	1
any,	1
8:44	1
Came	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
touched	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
his	1
garment:	1
and	1
immediately	1
her	1
issue	1
of	1
blood	1
stanched.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
When	1
all	1
denied,	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
said,	1
Master,	1
the	1
multitude	1
throng	1
thee	1
and	1
press	1
thee,	1
and	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Who	1
touched	1
me?	1
	1
8:46	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Somebody	1
hath	1
touched	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
virtue	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:47	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
woman	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
hid,	1
she	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
falling	1
down	1
before	1
him,	1
she	1
declared	1
unto	1
him	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
what	1
cause	1
she	1
had	1
touched	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
healed	1
immediately.	1
	1
8:48	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Daughter,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
comfort:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole;	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
8:49	1
While	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue's	1
house,	1
saying	1
to	1
him,	1
Thy	1
daughter	1
is	1
dead;	1
trouble	1
not	1
the	1
Master.	1
	1
8:50	1
But	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Fear	1
not:	1
believe	1
only,	1
and	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
whole.	1
	1
8:51	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
suffered	1
no	1
man	1
to	1
go	1
in,	1
save	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
maiden.	1
	1
8:52	1
And	1
all	1
wept,	1
and	1
bewailed	1
her:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
Weep	1
not;	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
dead,	1
but	1
sleepeth.	1
	1
8:53	1
And	1
they	1
laughed	1
him	1
to	1
scorn,	1
knowing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
8:54	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
called,	1
saying,	1
Maid,	1
arise.	1
	1
8:55	1
And	1
her	1
spirit	1
came	1
again,	1
and	1
she	1
arose	1
straightway:	1
and	1
he	1
commanded	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
meat.	1
	1
8:56	1
And	1
her	1
parents	1
were	1
astonished:	1
but	1
he	1
charged	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
what	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
9:1	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
twelve	1
disciples	1
together,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
over	1
all	1
devils,	1
and	1
to	1
cure	1
diseases.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
sick.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
nothing	1
for	1
your	1
journey,	1
neither	1
staves,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
neither	1
bread,	1
neither	1
money;	1
neither	1
have	1
two	1
coats	1
apiece.	1
	1
9:4	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter	1
into,	1
there	1
abide,	1
and	1
thence	1
depart.	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
whosoever	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
you,	1
when	1
ye	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
city,	1
shake	1
off	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
from	1
your	1
feet	1
for	1
a	1
testimony	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
they	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
towns,	1
preaching	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
healing	1
every	1
where.	1
	1
9:7	1
Now	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch	1
heard	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
perplexed,	1
because	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
9:8	1
And	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
Elias	1
had	1
appeared;	1
and	1
of	1
others,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
was	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
Herod	1
said,	1
John	1
have	1
I	1
beheaded:	1
but	1
who	1
is	1
this,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
hear	1
such	1
things?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
the	1
apostles,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
returned,	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
went	1
aside	1
privately	1
into	1
a	1
desert	1
place	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
called	1
Bethsaida.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
it,	1
followed	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
healed	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
need	1
of	1
healing.	1
	1
9:12	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
began	1
to	1
wear	1
away,	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
the	1
multitude	1
away,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
country	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
lodge,	1
and	1
get	1
victuals:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
desert	1
place.	1
	1
9:13	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Give	1
ye	1
them	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
but	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
two	1
fishes;	1
except	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
buy	1
meat	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
9:14	1
For	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
thousand	1
men.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Make	1
them	1
sit	1
down	1
by	1
fifties	1
in	1
a	1
company.	1
	1
9:15	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
all	1
sit	1
down.	1
	1
9:16	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
five	1
loaves	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fishes,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
filled:	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
of	1
fragments	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
them	1
twelve	1
baskets.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
alone	1
praying,	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Whom	1
say	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
9:19	1
They	1
answering	1
said,	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist;	1
but	1
some	1
say,	1
Elias;	1
and	1
others	1
say,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
prophets	1
is	1
risen	1
again.	1
	1
9:20	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
whom	1
say	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
Peter	1
answering	1
said,	1
The	1
Christ	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
And	1
he	1
straitly	1
charged	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thing;	1
9:22	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
the	1
elders	1
and	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes,	1
and	1
be	1
slain,	1
and	1
be	1
raised	1
the	1
third	1
day.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
deny	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
cross	1
daily,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
9:24	1
For	1
whosoever	1
will	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it:	1
but	1
whosoever	1
will	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
save	1
it.	1
	1
9:25	1
For	1
what	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
advantaged,	1
if	1
he	1
gain	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
and	1
lose	1
himself,	1
or	1
be	1
cast	1
away?	1
	1
9:26	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
words,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
glory,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
Father's,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
angels.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
there	1
be	1
some	1
standing	1
here,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
taste	1
of	1
death,	1
till	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
about	1
an	1
eight	1
days	1
after	1
these	1
sayings,	1
he	1
took	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
to	1
pray.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
prayed,	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
his	1
countenance	1
was	1
altered,	1
and	1
his	1
raiment	1
was	1
white	1
and	1
glistering.	1
	1
9:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
talked	1
with	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
which	1
were	1
Moses	1
and	1
Elias:	1
9:31	1
Who	1
appeared	1
in	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
decease	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
accomplish	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:32	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
were	1
heavy	1
with	1
sleep:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
awake,	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
that	1
stood	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him,	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
here:	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
three	1
tabernacles;	1
one	1
for	1
thee,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Moses,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
Elias:	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
	1
9:34	1
While	1
he	1
thus	1
spake,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
cloud,	1
and	1
overshadowed	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
cloud.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cloud,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
Son:	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
9:36	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
past,	1
Jesus	1
was	1
found	1
alone.	1
And	1
they	1
kept	1
it	1
close,	1
and	1
told	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hill,	1
much	1
people	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
9:38	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
look	1
upon	1
my	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
mine	1
only	1
child.	1
	1
9:39	1
And,	1
lo,	1
a	1
spirit	1
taketh	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
suddenly	1
crieth	1
out;	1
and	1
it	1
teareth	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
foameth	1
again,	1
and	1
bruising	1
him	1
hardly	1
departeth	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
I	1
besought	1
thy	1
disciples	1
to	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
O	1
faithless	1
and	1
perverse	1
generation,	1
how	1
long	1
shall	1
I	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
suffer	1
you?	1
Bring	1
thy	1
son	1
hither.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
coming,	1
the	1
devil	1
threw	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
tare	1
him.	1
	1
And	1
Jesus	1
rebuked	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit,	1
and	1
healed	1
the	1
child,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
mighty	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
But	1
while	1
they	1
wondered	1
every	1
one	1
at	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
9:44	1
Let	1
these	1
sayings	1
sink	1
down	1
into	1
your	1
ears:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
9:45	1
But	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
perceived	1
it	1
not:	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
saying.	1
	1
9:46	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
reasoning	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
greatest.	1
	1
9:47	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
perceiving	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
their	1
heart,	1
took	1
a	1
child,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
by	1
him,	1
9:48	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
this	1
child	1
in	1
my	1
name	1
receiveth	1
me:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
receive	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
least	1
among	1
you	1
all,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
be	1
great.	1
	1
9:49	1
And	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Master,	1
we	1
saw	1
one	1
casting	1
out	1
devils	1
in	1
thy	1
name;	1
and	1
we	1
forbad	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
followeth	1
not	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
9:50	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Forbid	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
against	1
us	1
is	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
9:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
received	1
up,	1
he	1
stedfastly	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
9:52	1
And	1
sent	1
messengers	1
before	1
his	1
face:	1
and	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans,	1
to	1
make	1
ready	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
9:53	1
And	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
receive	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:54	1
And	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
James	1
and	1
John	1
saw	1
this,	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
command	1
fire	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
consume	1
them,	1
even	1
as	1
Elias	1
did?	1
	1
9:55	1
But	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
rebuked	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
spirit	1
ye	1
are	1
of.	1
	1
9:56	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
destroy	1
men's	1
lives,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
them.	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
another	1
village.	1
	1
9:57	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
whithersoever	1
thou	1
goest.	1
	1
9:58	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Foxes	1
have	1
holes,	1
and	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
have	1
nests;	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
hath	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
9:59	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
another,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
suffer	1
me	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
bury	1
my	1
father.	1
	1
9:60	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Let	1
the	1
dead	1
bury	1
their	1
dead:	1
but	1
go	1
thou	1
and	1
preach	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:61	1
And	1
another	1
also	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee;	1
but	1
let	1
me	1
first	1
go	1
bid	1
them	1
farewell,	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
home	1
at	1
my	1
house.	1
	1
9:62	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
No	1
man,	1
having	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
plough,	1
and	1
looking	1
back,	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
LORD	1
appointed	1
other	1
seventy	1
also,	1
and	1
sent	1
them	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
before	1
his	1
face	1
into	1
every	1
city	1
and	1
place,	1
whither	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
come.	1
	1
10:2	1
Therefore	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
harvest	1
truly	1
is	1
great,	1
but	1
the	1
labourers	1
are	1
few:	1
pray	1
ye	1
therefore	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
the	1
harvest,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
forth	1
labourers	1
into	1
his	1
harvest.	1
	1
10:3	1
Go	1
your	1
ways:	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
you	1
forth	1
as	1
lambs	1
among	1
wolves.	1
	1
10:4	1
Carry	1
neither	1
purse,	1
nor	1
scrip,	1
nor	1
shoes:	1
and	1
salute	1
no	1
man	1
by	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
house	1
ye	1
enter,	1
first	1
say,	1
Peace	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
house.	1
	1
10:6	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
there,	1
your	1
peace	1
shall	1
rest	1
upon	1
it:	1
if	1
not,	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
again.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
remain,	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
give:	1
for	1
the	1
labourer	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
hire.	1
Go	1
not	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house.	1
	1
10:8	1
And	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you,	1
eat	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
are	1
set	1
before	1
you:	1
10:9	1
And	1
heal	1
the	1
sick	1
that	1
are	1
therein,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:10	1
But	1
into	1
whatsoever	1
city	1
ye	1
enter,	1
and	1
they	1
receive	1
you	1
not,	1
go	1
your	1
ways	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
say,	1
10:11	1
Even	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
of	1
your	1
city,	1
which	1
cleaveth	1
on	1
us,	1
we	1
do	1
wipe	1
off	1
against	1
you:	1
notwithstanding	1
be	1
ye	1
sure	1
of	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
for	1
Sodom,	1
than	1
for	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
10:13	1
Woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Chorazin!	1
woe	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Bethsaida!	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
ago	1
repented,	1
sitting	1
in	1
sackcloth	1
and	1
ashes.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
tolerable	1
for	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon	1
at	1
the	1
judgment,	1
than	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
thou,	1
Capernaum,	1
which	1
art	1
exalted	1
to	1
heaven,	1
shalt	1
be	1
thrust	1
down	1
to	1
hell.	1
	1
10:16	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
you	1
heareth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
you	1
despiseth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
despiseth	1
me	1
despiseth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
10:17	1
And	1
the	1
seventy	1
returned	1
again	1
with	1
joy,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
even	1
the	1
devils	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
us	1
through	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
10:18	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
beheld	1
Satan	1
as	1
lightning	1
fall	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:19	1
Behold,	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you	1
power	1
to	1
tread	1
on	1
serpents	1
and	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
enemy:	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
hurt	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
Notwithstanding	1
in	1
this	1
rejoice	1
not,	1
that	1
the	1
spirits	1
are	1
subject	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
rather	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
your	1
names	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:21	1
In	1
that	1
hour	1
Jesus	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
O	1
Father,	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
hid	1
these	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent,	1
and	1
hast	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
babes:	1
even	1
so,	1
Father;	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
in	1
thy	1
sight.	1
	1
10:22	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
delivered	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
who	1
the	1
Son	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
who	1
the	1
Father	1
is,	1
but	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Son	1
will	1
reveal	1
him.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
he	1
turned	1
him	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said	1
privately,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
eyes	1
which	1
see	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
ye	1
see:	1
10:24	1
For	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
many	1
prophets	1
and	1
kings	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
see	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
see,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
hear,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
10:25	1
And,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
lawyer	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
tempted	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
10:26	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law?	1
how	1
readest	1
thou?	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
the	1
Lord	1
thy	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
strength,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
mind;	1
and	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
answered	1
right:	1
this	1
do,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
live.	1
	1
10:29	1
But	1
he,	1
willing	1
to	1
justify	1
himself,	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
neighbour?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
Jericho,	1
and	1
fell	1
among	1
thieves,	1
which	1
stripped	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
wounded	1
him,	1
and	1
departed,	1
leaving	1
him	1
half	1
dead.	1
	1
10:31	1
And	1
by	1
chance	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
a	1
certain	1
priest	1
that	1
way:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:32	1
And	1
likewise	1
a	1
Levite,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
came	1
and	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
	1
10:33	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
Samaritan,	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
came	1
where	1
he	1
was:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
compassion	1
on	1
him,	1
10:34	1
And	1
went	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
bound	1
up	1
his	1
wounds,	1
pouring	1
in	1
oil	1
and	1
wine,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
beast,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
an	1
inn,	1
and	1
took	1
care	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
10:35	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
when	1
he	1
departed,	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
two	1
pence,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
care	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
spendest	1
more,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
again,	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
thee.	1
	1
10:36	1
Which	1
now	1
of	1
these	1
three,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
was	1
neighbour	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
fell	1
among	1
the	1
thieves?	1
	1
10:37	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
shewed	1
mercy	1
on	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
likewise.	1
	1
10:38	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
that	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village:	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Martha	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
her	1
house.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
sister	1
called	1
Mary,	1
which	1
also	1
sat	1
at	1
Jesus'	1
feet,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
word.	1
	1
10:40	1
But	1
Martha	1
was	1
cumbered	1
about	1
much	1
serving,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
not	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
hath	1
left	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
alone?	1
	1
bid	1
her	1
therefore	1
that	1
she	1
help	1
me.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Martha,	1
Martha,	1
thou	1
art	1
careful	1
and	1
troubled	1
about	1
many	1
things:	1
10:42	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
needful:	1
and	1
Mary	1
hath	1
chosen	1
that	1
good	1
part,	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
her.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
praying	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
place,	1
when	1
he	1
ceased,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
pray,	1
as	1
John	1
also	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
pray,	1
say,	1
Our	1
Father	1
which	1
art	1
in	1
heaven,	1
Hallowed	1
be	1
thy	1
name.	1
Thy	1
kingdom	1
come.	1
Thy	1
will	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
in	1
heaven,	1
so	1
in	1
earth.	1
	1
11:3	1
Give	1
us	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
our	1
daily	1
bread.	1
	1
11:4	1
And	1
forgive	1
us	1
our	1
sins;	1
for	1
we	1
also	1
forgive	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
indebted	1
to	1
us.	1
And	1
lead	1
us	1
not	1
into	1
temptation;	1
but	1
deliver	1
us	1
from	1
evil.	1
	1
11:5	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
friend,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
at	1
midnight,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Friend,	1
lend	1
me	1
three	1
loaves;	1
11:6	1
For	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine	1
in	1
his	1
journey	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
him?	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
he	1
from	1
within	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say,	1
Trouble	1
me	1
not:	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
now	1
shut,	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
bed;	1
I	1
cannot	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
thee.	1
	1
11:8	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Though	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
his	1
friend,	1
yet	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
importunity	1
he	1
will	1
rise	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
needeth.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ask,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
you;	1
seek,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find;	1
knock,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
asketh	1
receiveth;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
findeth;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
knocketh	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
opened.	1
	1
11:11	1
If	1
a	1
son	1
shall	1
ask	1
bread	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
father,	1
will	1
he	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
stone?	1
or	1
if	1
he	1
ask	1
a	1
fish,	1
will	1
he	1
for	1
a	1
fish	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
serpent?	1
	1
11:12	1
Or	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
ask	1
an	1
egg,	1
will	1
he	1
offer	1
him	1
a	1
scorpion?	1
	1
11:13	1
If	1
ye	1
then,	1
being	1
evil,	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
good	1
gifts	1
unto	1
your	1
children:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
your	1
heavenly	1
Father	1
give	1
the	1
Holy	1
Spirit	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
ask	1
him?	1
	1
11:14	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
casting	1
out	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
dumb.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
the	1
dumb	1
spake;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
wondered.	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
casteth	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
devils.	1
	1
11:16	1
And	1
others,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
sought	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
sign	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:17	1
But	1
he,	1
knowing	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Every	1
kingdom	1
divided	1
against	1
itself	1
is	1
brought	1
to	1
desolation;	1
and	1
a	1
house	1
divided	1
against	1
a	1
house	1
falleth.	1
	1
11:18	1
If	1
Satan	1
also	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
himself,	1
how	1
shall	1
his	1
kingdom	1
stand?	1
because	1
ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils	1
through	1
Beelzebub.	1
	1
11:19	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
Beelzebub	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
by	1
whom	1
do	1
your	1
sons	1
cast	1
them	1
out?	1
therefore	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
your	1
judges.	1
	1
11:20	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
with	1
the	1
finger	1
of	1
God	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you.	1
	1
11:21	1
When	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
armed	1
keepeth	1
his	1
palace,	1
his	1
goods	1
are	1
in	1
peace:	1
11:22	1
But	1
when	1
a	1
stronger	1
than	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
overcome	1
him,	1
he	1
taketh	1
from	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
armour	1
wherein	1
he	1
trusted,	1
and	1
divideth	1
his	1
spoils.	1
	1
11:23	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
is	1
against	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
gathereth	1
not	1
with	1
me	1
scattereth.	1
	1
11:24	1
When	1
the	1
unclean	1
spirit	1
is	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
walketh	1
through	1
dry	1
places,	1
seeking	1
rest;	1
and	1
finding	1
none,	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
unto	1
my	1
house	1
whence	1
I	1
came	1
out.	1
	1
11:25	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
he	1
findeth	1
it	1
swept	1
and	1
garnished.	1
	1
11:26	1
Then	1
goeth	1
he,	1
and	1
taketh	1
to	1
him	1
seven	1
other	1
spirits	1
more	1
wicked	1
than	1
himself;	1
and	1
they	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
dwell	1
there:	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
state	1
of	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
first.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
things,	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
womb	1
that	1
bare	1
thee,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
sucked.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
Yea	1
rather,	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
keep	1
it.	1
	1
11:29	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
gathered	1
thick	1
together,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
generation:	1
they	1
seek	1
a	1
sign;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
sign	1
be	1
given	1
it,	1
but	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
Jonas	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
Jonas	1
was	1
a	1
sign	1
unto	1
the	1
Ninevites,	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
south	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
condemn	1
them:	1
for	1
she	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
utmost	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
Solomon;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Solomon	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:32	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
Nineve	1
shall	1
rise	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
with	1
this	1
generation,	1
and	1
shall	1
condemn	1
it:	1
for	1
they	1
repented	1
at	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jonas;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
greater	1
than	1
Jonas	1
is	1
here.	1
	1
11:33	1
No	1
man,	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
lighted	1
a	1
candle,	1
putteth	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
place,	1
neither	1
under	1
a	1
bushel,	1
but	1
on	1
a	1
candlestick,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
come	1
in	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
light.	1
	1
11:34	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
eye:	1
therefore	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
single,	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
light;	1
but	1
when	1
thine	1
eye	1
is	1
evil,	1
thy	1
body	1
also	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:35	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
be	1
not	1
darkness.	1
	1
11:36	1
If	1
thy	1
whole	1
body	1
therefore	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
having	1
no	1
part	1
dark,	1
the	1
whole	1
shall	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
light,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
bright	1
shining	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
doth	1
give	1
thee	1
light.	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
spake,	1
a	1
certain	1
Pharisee	1
besought	1
him	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
meat.	1
	1
11:38	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Pharisee	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
first	1
washed	1
before	1
dinner.	1
	1
11:39	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
do	1
ye	1
Pharisees	1
make	1
clean	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
the	1
cup	1
and	1
the	1
platter;	1
but	1
your	1
inward	1
part	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
ravening	1
and	1
wickedness.	1
	1
11:40	1
Ye	1
fools,	1
did	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
made	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
without	1
make	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
also?	1
	1
11:41	1
But	1
rather	1
give	1
alms	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
ye	1
have;	1
and,	1
behold,	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
clean	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
11:42	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
tithe	1
mint	1
and	1
rue	1
and	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
herbs,	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
judgment	1
and	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God:	1
these	1
ought	1
ye	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
other	1
undone.	1
	1
11:43	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
Pharisees!	1
for	1
ye	1
love	1
the	1
uppermost	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets.	1
	1
11:44	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
hypocrites!	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
as	1
graves	1
which	1
appear	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
walk	1
over	1
them	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lawyers,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
thus	1
saying	1
thou	1
reproachest	1
us	1
also.	1
	1
11:46	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you	1
also,	1
ye	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
lade	1
men	1
with	1
burdens	1
grievous	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
and	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
touch	1
not	1
the	1
burdens	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
fingers.	1
	1
11:47	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you!	1
for	1
ye	1
build	1
the	1
sepulchres	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
your	1
fathers	1
killed	1
them.	1
	1
11:48	1
Truly	1
ye	1
bear	1
witness	1
that	1
ye	1
allow	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
fathers:	1
for	1
they	1
indeed	1
killed	1
them,	1
and	1
ye	1
build	1
their	1
sepulchres.	1
	1
11:49	1
Therefore	1
also	1
said	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
them	1
prophets	1
and	1
apostles,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
shall	1
slay	1
and	1
persecute:	1
11:50	1
That	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
which	1
was	1
shed	1
from	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
may	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation;	1
11:51	1
From	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Abel	1
unto	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Zacharias	1
which	1
perished	1
between	1
the	1
altar	1
and	1
the	1
temple:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
It	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
11:52	1
Woe	1
unto	1
you,	1
lawyers!	1
for	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
knowledge:	1
ye	1
entered	1
not	1
in	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
entering	1
in	1
ye	1
hindered.	1
	1
11:53	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
began	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
vehemently,	1
and	1
to	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
many	1
things:	1
11:54	1
Laying	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
seeking	1
to	1
catch	1
something	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
an	1
innumerable	1
multitude	1
of	1
people,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
trode	1
one	1
upon	1
another,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
Beware	1
ye	1
of	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
which	1
is	1
hypocrisy.	1
	1
12:2	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
covered,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
revealed;	1
neither	1
hid,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
known.	1
	1
12:3	1
Therefore	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
darkness	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
light;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
in	1
the	1
ear	1
in	1
closets	1
shall	1
be	1
proclaimed	1
upon	1
the	1
housetops.	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you	1
my	1
friends,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
kill	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
do.	1
	1
12:5	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
forewarn	1
you	1
whom	1
ye	1
shall	1
fear:	1
Fear	1
him,	1
which	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
killed	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
cast	1
into	1
hell;	1
yea,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Fear	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
Are	1
not	1
five	1
sparrows	1
sold	1
for	1
two	1
farthings,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
forgotten	1
before	1
God?	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
hairs	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
are	1
all	1
numbered.	1
Fear	1
not	1
therefore:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
than	1
many	1
sparrows.	1
	1
12:8	1
Also	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
confess	1
me	1
before	1
men,	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
also	1
confess	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God:	1
12:9	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
denieth	1
me	1
before	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
denied	1
before	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:10	1
And	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
against	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
forgiven	1
him:	1
but	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
blasphemeth	1
against	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
forgiven.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
bring	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
unto	1
magistrates,	1
and	1
powers,	1
take	1
ye	1
no	1
thought	1
how	1
or	1
what	1
thing	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
say:	1
12:12	1
For	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
what	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
say.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
speak	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
that	1
he	1
divide	1
the	1
inheritance	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Man,	1
who	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
judge	1
or	1
a	1
divider	1
over	1
you?	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
heed,	1
and	1
beware	1
of	1
covetousness:	1
for	1
a	1
man's	1
life	1
consisteth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possesseth.	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
ground	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man	1
brought	1
forth	1
plentifully:	1
12:17	1
And	1
he	1
thought	1
within	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
room	1
where	1
to	1
bestow	1
my	1
fruits?	1
	1
12:18	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
will	1
I	1
do:	1
I	1
will	1
pull	1
down	1
my	1
barns,	1
and	1
build	1
greater;	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
fruits	1
and	1
my	1
goods.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
soul,	1
Soul,	1
thou	1
hast	1
much	1
goods	1
laid	1
up	1
for	1
many	1
years;	1
take	1
thine	1
ease,	1
eat,	1
drink,	1
and	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
God	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
this	1
night	1
thy	1
soul	1
shall	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
thee:	1
then	1
whose	1
shall	1
those	1
things	1
be,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
provided?	1
	1
12:21	1
So	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
layeth	1
up	1
treasure	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
rich	1
toward	1
God.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Therefore	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Take	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
your	1
life,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat;	1
neither	1
for	1
the	1
body,	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
put	1
on.	1
	1
12:23	1
The	1
life	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
meat,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
raiment.	1
	1
12:24	1
Consider	1
the	1
ravens:	1
for	1
they	1
neither	1
sow	1
nor	1
reap;	1
which	1
neither	1
have	1
storehouse	1
nor	1
barn;	1
and	1
God	1
feedeth	1
them:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
are	1
ye	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
fowls?	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
which	1
of	1
you	1
with	1
taking	1
thought	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
stature	1
one	1
cubit?	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
ye	1
then	1
be	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
least,	1
why	1
take	1
ye	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
rest?	1
	1
12:27	1
Consider	1
the	1
lilies	1
how	1
they	1
grow:	1
they	1
toil	1
not,	1
they	1
spin	1
not;	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
Solomon	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
glory	1
was	1
not	1
arrayed	1
like	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
	1
12:28	1
If	1
then	1
God	1
so	1
clothe	1
the	1
grass,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow	1
is	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
oven;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
will	1
he	1
clothe	1
you,	1
O	1
ye	1
of	1
little	1
faith?	1
	1
12:29	1
And	1
seek	1
not	1
ye	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
eat,	1
or	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
drink,	1
neither	1
be	1
ye	1
of	1
doubtful	1
mind.	1
	1
12:30	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
do	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seek	1
after:	1
and	1
your	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
rather	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
added	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
12:32	1
Fear	1
not,	1
little	1
flock;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
Father's	1
good	1
pleasure	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
	1
12:33	1
Sell	1
that	1
ye	1
have,	1
and	1
give	1
alms;	1
provide	1
yourselves	1
bags	1
which	1
wax	1
not	1
old,	1
a	1
treasure	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
that	1
faileth	1
not,	1
where	1
no	1
thief	1
approacheth,	1
neither	1
moth	1
corrupteth.	1
	1
12:34	1
For	1
where	1
your	1
treasure	1
is,	1
there	1
will	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
12:35	1
Let	1
your	1
loins	1
be	1
girded	1
about,	1
and	1
your	1
lights	1
burning;	1
12:36	1
And	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
like	1
unto	1
men	1
that	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
lord,	1
when	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
wedding;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
and	1
knocketh,	1
they	1
may	1
open	1
unto	1
him	1
immediately.	1
	1
12:37	1
Blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants,	1
whom	1
the	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
watching:	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
gird	1
himself,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
forth	1
and	1
serve	1
them.	1
	1
12:38	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
watch,	1
or	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
watch,	1
and	1
find	1
them	1
so,	1
blessed	1
are	1
those	1
servants.	1
	1
12:39	1
And	1
this	1
know,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
known	1
what	1
hour	1
the	1
thief	1
would	1
come,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
suffered	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
through.	1
	1
12:40	1
Be	1
ye	1
therefore	1
ready	1
also:	1
for	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
ye	1
think	1
not.	1
	1
12:41	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
speakest	1
thou	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
us,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
all?	1
	1
12:42	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
that	1
faithful	1
and	1
wise	1
steward,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
shall	1
make	1
ruler	1
over	1
his	1
household,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
their	1
portion	1
of	1
meat	1
in	1
due	1
season?	1
	1
12:43	1
Blessed	1
is	1
that	1
servant,	1
whom	1
his	1
lord	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
shall	1
find	1
so	1
doing.	1
	1
12:44	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
ruler	1
over	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath.	1
	1
12:45	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
servant	1
say	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
My	1
lord	1
delayeth	1
his	1
coming;	1
and	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
beat	1
the	1
menservants	1
and	1
maidens,	1
and	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
drunken;	1
12:46	1
The	1
lord	1
of	1
that	1
servant	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
looketh	1
not	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
at	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
aware,	1
and	1
will	1
cut	1
him	1
in	1
sunder,	1
and	1
will	1
appoint	1
him	1
his	1
portion	1
with	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
that	1
servant,	1
which	1
knew	1
his	1
lord's	1
will,	1
and	1
prepared	1
not	1
himself,	1
neither	1
did	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
many	1
stripes.	1
	1
12:48	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
knew	1
not,	1
and	1
did	1
commit	1
things	1
worthy	1
of	1
stripes,	1
shall	1
be	1
beaten	1
with	1
few	1
stripes.	1
For	1
unto	1
whomsoever	1
much	1
is	1
given,	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
much	1
required:	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
men	1
have	1
committed	1
much,	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
will	1
ask	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
12:49	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
send	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
what	1
will	1
I,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
already	1
kindled?	1
	1
12:50	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
baptism	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
with;	1
and	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
straitened	1
till	1
it	1
be	1
accomplished!	1
	1
12:51	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
to	1
give	1
peace	1
on	1
earth?	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
rather	1
division:	1
12:52	1
For	1
from	1
henceforth	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
five	1
in	1
one	1
house	1
divided,	1
three	1
against	1
two,	1
and	1
two	1
against	1
three.	1
	1
12:53	1
The	1
father	1
shall	1
be	1
divided	1
against	1
the	1
son,	1
and	1
the	1
son	1
against	1
the	1
father;	1
the	1
mother	1
against	1
the	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
against	1
the	1
mother;	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
daughter	1
in	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
daughter	1
in	1
law	1
against	1
her	1
mother	1
in	1
law.	1
	1
12:54	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
When	1
ye	1
see	1
a	1
cloud	1
rise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
west,	1
straightway	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
shower;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
12:55	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blow,	1
ye	1
say,	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
heat;	1
and	1
it	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
12:56	1
Ye	1
hypocrites,	1
ye	1
can	1
discern	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
but	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
do	1
not	1
discern	1
this	1
time?	1
	1
12:57	1
Yea,	1
and	1
why	1
even	1
of	1
yourselves	1
judge	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
right?	1
	1
12:58	1
When	1
thou	1
goest	1
with	1
thine	1
adversary	1
to	1
the	1
magistrate,	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
give	1
diligence	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
him;	1
lest	1
he	1
hale	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
judge,	1
and	1
the	1
judge	1
deliver	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
officer,	1
and	1
the	1
officer	1
cast	1
thee	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
12:59	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
depart	1
thence,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
paid	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
mite.	1
	1
13:1	1
There	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
some	1
that	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
whose	1
blood	1
Pilate	1
had	1
mingled	1
with	1
their	1
sacrifices.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Suppose	1
ye	1
that	1
these	1
Galilaeans	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
Galilaeans,	1
because	1
they	1
suffered	1
such	1
things?	1
	1
13:3	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:4	1
Or	1
those	1
eighteen,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
tower	1
in	1
Siloam	1
fell,	1
and	1
slew	1
them,	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sinners	1
above	1
all	1
men	1
that	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Jerusalem?	1
	1
13:5	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Nay:	1
but,	1
except	1
ye	1
repent,	1
ye	1
shall	1
all	1
likewise	1
perish.	1
	1
13:6	1
He	1
spake	1
also	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
fig	1
tree	1
planted	1
in	1
his	1
vineyard;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
sought	1
fruit	1
thereon,	1
and	1
found	1
none.	1
	1
13:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
dresser	1
of	1
his	1
vineyard,	1
Behold,	1
these	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
come	1
seeking	1
fruit	1
on	1
this	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
find	1
none:	1
cut	1
it	1
down;	1
why	1
cumbereth	1
it	1
the	1
ground?	1
	1
13:8	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
let	1
it	1
alone	1
this	1
year	1
also,	1
till	1
I	1
shall	1
dig	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
dung	1
it:	1
13:9	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
bear	1
fruit,	1
well:	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
after	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cut	1
it	1
down.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
infirmity	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
bowed	1
together,	1
and	1
could	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
lift	1
up	1
herself.	1
	1
13:12	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
her,	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
thou	1
art	1
loosed	1
from	1
thine	1
infirmity.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
her:	1
and	1
immediately	1
she	1
was	1
made	1
straight,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God.	1
	1
13:14	1
And	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
answered	1
with	1
indignation,	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
healed	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
There	1
are	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
which	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
work:	1
in	1
them	1
therefore	1
come	1
and	1
be	1
healed,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
13:15	1
The	1
Lord	1
then	1
answered	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hypocrite,	1
doth	1
not	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
loose	1
his	1
ox	1
or	1
his	1
ass	1
from	1
the	1
stall,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
watering?	1
	1
13:16	1
And	1
ought	1
not	1
this	1
woman,	1
being	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
whom	1
Satan	1
hath	1
bound,	1
lo,	1
these	1
eighteen	1
years,	1
be	1
loosed	1
from	1
this	1
bond	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
13:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
things,	1
all	1
his	1
adversaries	1
were	1
ashamed:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
glorious	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
13:18	1
Then	1
said	1
he,	1
Unto	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
like?	1
and	1
whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
resemble	1
it?	1
	1
13:19	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
took,	1
and	1
cast	1
into	1
his	1
garden;	1
and	1
it	1
grew,	1
and	1
waxed	1
a	1
great	1
tree;	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
said,	1
Whereunto	1
shall	1
I	1
liken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
13:21	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
leaven,	1
which	1
a	1
woman	1
took	1
and	1
hid	1
in	1
three	1
measures	1
of	1
meal,	1
till	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
leavened.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
villages,	1
teaching,	1
and	1
journeying	1
toward	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:23	1
Then	1
said	1
one	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
are	1
there	1
few	1
that	1
be	1
saved?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
13:24	1
Strive	1
to	1
enter	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
strait	1
gate:	1
for	1
many,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
will	1
seek	1
to	1
enter	1
in,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able.	1
	1
13:25	1
When	1
once	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
risen	1
up,	1
and	1
hath	1
shut	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
stand	1
without,	1
and	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
Lord,	1
open	1
unto	1
us;	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
answer	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are:	1
13:26	1
Then	1
shall	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
say,	1
We	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk	1
in	1
thy	1
presence,	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
taught	1
in	1
our	1
streets.	1
	1
13:27	1
But	1
he	1
shall	1
say,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not	1
whence	1
ye	1
are;	1
depart	1
from	1
me,	1
all	1
ye	1
workers	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
13:28	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
weeping	1
and	1
gnashing	1
of	1
teeth,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
Jacob,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
you	1
yourselves	1
thrust	1
out.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
east,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
west,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
north,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
shall	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:30	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
are	1
last	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
first,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
first	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
last.	1
	1
13:31	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
came	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out,	1
and	1
depart	1
hence:	1
for	1
Herod	1
will	1
kill	1
thee.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
ye,	1
and	1
tell	1
that	1
fox,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
cast	1
out	1
devils,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
cures	1
to	1
day	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
perfected.	1
	1
13:33	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
must	1
walk	1
to	1
day,	1
and	1
to	1
morrow,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following:	1
for	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
perish	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:34	1
O	1
Jerusalem,	1
Jerusalem,	1
which	1
killest	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
stonest	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sent	1
unto	1
thee;	1
how	1
often	1
would	1
I	1
have	1
gathered	1
thy	1
children	1
together,	1
as	1
a	1
hen	1
doth	1
gather	1
her	1
brood	1
under	1
her	1
wings,	1
and	1
ye	1
would	1
not!	1
	1
13:35	1
Behold,	1
your	1
house	1
is	1
left	1
unto	1
you	1
desolate:	1
and	1
verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me,	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
Pharisees	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
watched	1
him.	1
	1
14:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
before	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
dropsy.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
lawyers	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
to	1
heal	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go;	1
14:5	1
And	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
an	1
ass	1
or	1
an	1
ox	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
pit,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
straightway	1
pull	1
him	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
14:6	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
he	1
put	1
forth	1
a	1
parable	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
bidden,	1
when	1
he	1
marked	1
how	1
they	1
chose	1
out	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms;	1
saying	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:8	1
When	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
a	1
wedding,	1
sit	1
not	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
room;	1
lest	1
a	1
more	1
honourable	1
man	1
than	1
thou	1
be	1
bidden	1
of	1
him;	1
14:9	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
and	1
him	1
come	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
this	1
man	1
place;	1
and	1
thou	1
begin	1
with	1
shame	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
lowest	1
room.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
bidden,	1
go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
lowest	1
room;	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
that	1
bade	1
thee	1
cometh,	1
he	1
may	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Friend,	1
go	1
up	1
higher:	1
then	1
shalt	1
thou	1
have	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
whosoever	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
14:12	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
also	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
bade	1
him,	1
When	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
dinner	1
or	1
a	1
supper,	1
call	1
not	1
thy	1
friends,	1
nor	1
thy	1
brethren,	1
neither	1
thy	1
kinsmen,	1
nor	1
thy	1
rich	1
neighbours;	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
bid	1
thee	1
again,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
be	1
made	1
thee.	1
	1
14:13	1
But	1
when	1
thou	1
makest	1
a	1
feast,	1
call	1
the	1
poor,	1
the	1
maimed,	1
the	1
lame,	1
the	1
blind:	1
14:14	1
And	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blessed;	1
for	1
they	1
cannot	1
recompense	1
thee:	1
for	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
recompensed	1
at	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
just.	1
	1
14:15	1
And	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Blessed	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
eat	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:16	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
him,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
supper,	1
and	1
bade	1
many:	1
14:17	1
And	1
sent	1
his	1
servant	1
at	1
supper	1
time	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
bidden,	1
Come;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
now	1
ready.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
consent	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
excuse.	1
The	1
first	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ground,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
it:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
five	1
yoke	1
of	1
oxen,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prove	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
have	1
me	1
excused.	1
	1
14:20	1
And	1
another	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
married	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
14:21	1
So	1
that	1
servant	1
came,	1
and	1
shewed	1
his	1
lord	1
these	1
things.	1
Then	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
being	1
angry	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
quickly	1
into	1
the	1
streets	1
and	1
lanes	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
bring	1
in	1
hither	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
the	1
maimed,	1
and	1
the	1
halt,	1
and	1
the	1
blind.	1
	1
14:22	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
commanded,	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
room.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
servant,	1
Go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
highways	1
and	1
hedges,	1
and	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
in,	1
that	1
my	1
house	1
may	1
be	1
filled.	1
	1
14:24	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
bidden	1
shall	1
taste	1
of	1
my	1
supper.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
there	1
went	1
great	1
multitudes	1
with	1
him:	1
and	1
he	1
turned,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
14:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
hate	1
not	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
wife,	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sisters,	1
yea,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
also,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
whosoever	1
doth	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
cross,	1
and	1
come	1
after	1
me,	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:28	1
For	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
intending	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
tower,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
counteth	1
the	1
cost,	1
whether	1
he	1
have	1
sufficient	1
to	1
finish	1
it?	1
14:29	1
Lest	1
haply,	1
after	1
he	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish	1
it,	1
all	1
that	1
behold	1
it	1
begin	1
to	1
mock	1
him,	1
14:30	1
Saying,	1
This	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
build,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
finish.	1
	1
14:31	1
Or	1
what	1
king,	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
against	1
another	1
king,	1
sitteth	1
not	1
down	1
first,	1
and	1
consulteth	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
able	1
with	1
ten	1
thousand	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
against	1
him	1
with	1
twenty	1
thousand?	1
	1
14:32	1
Or	1
else,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
he	1
sendeth	1
an	1
ambassage,	1
and	1
desireth	1
conditions	1
of	1
peace.	1
	1
14:33	1
So	1
likewise,	1
whosoever	1
he	1
be	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
forsaketh	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
hath,	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
my	1
disciple.	1
	1
14:34	1
Salt	1
is	1
good:	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
salt	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
savour,	1
wherewith	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
seasoned?	1
	1
14:35	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
nor	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
dunghill;	1
but	1
men	1
cast	1
it	1
out.	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
let	1
him	1
hear.	1
	1
15:1	1
Then	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
publicans	1
and	1
sinners	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
15:2	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
scribes	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
receiveth	1
sinners,	1
and	1
eateth	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
15:4	1
What	1
man	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
an	1
hundred	1
sheep,	1
if	1
he	1
lose	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
doth	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
go	1
after	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
lost,	1
until	1
he	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:5	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
he	1
layeth	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
cometh	1
home,	1
he	1
calleth	1
together	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
neighbours,	1
saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
my	1
sheep	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
15:7	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
likewise	1
joy	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
heaven	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth,	1
more	1
than	1
over	1
ninety	1
and	1
nine	1
just	1
persons,	1
which	1
need	1
no	1
repentance.	1
	1
15:8	1
Either	1
what	1
woman	1
having	1
ten	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver,	1
if	1
she	1
lose	1
one	1
piece,	1
doth	1
not	1
light	1
a	1
candle,	1
and	1
sweep	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
seek	1
diligently	1
till	1
she	1
find	1
it?	1
	1
15:9	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
hath	1
found	1
it,	1
she	1
calleth	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
her	1
neighbours	1
together,	1
saying,	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
piece	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
lost.	1
	1
15:10	1
Likewise,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
there	1
is	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
over	1
one	1
sinner	1
that	1
repenteth.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
had	1
two	1
sons:	1
15:12	1
And	1
the	1
younger	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Father,	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
goods	1
that	1
falleth	1
to	1
me.	1
And	1
he	1
divided	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
living.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
gathered	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
journey	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country,	1
and	1
there	1
wasted	1
his	1
substance	1
with	1
riotous	1
living.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
all,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
mighty	1
famine	1
in	1
that	1
land;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
want.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
joined	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
that	1
country;	1
and	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
fields	1
to	1
feed	1
swine.	1
	1
15:16	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
fain	1
have	1
filled	1
his	1
belly	1
with	1
the	1
husks	1
that	1
the	1
swine	1
did	1
eat:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
gave	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
15:17	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
many	1
hired	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
have	1
bread	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare,	1
and	1
I	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger!	1
15:18	1
I	1
will	1
arise	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
before	1
thee,	1
15:19	1
And	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son:	1
make	1
me	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
thy	1
hired	1
servants.	1
	1
15:20	1
And	1
he	1
arose,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
father.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
off,	1
his	1
father	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
compassion,	1
and	1
ran,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him.	1
	1
15:21	1
And	1
the	1
son	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Father,	1
I	1
have	1
sinned	1
against	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
thy	1
son.	1
	1
15:22	1
But	1
the	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
servants,	1
Bring	1
forth	1
the	1
best	1
robe,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
ring	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
shoes	1
on	1
his	1
feet:	1
15:23	1
And	1
bring	1
hither	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
and	1
kill	1
it;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
eat,	1
and	1
be	1
merry:	1
15:24	1
For	1
this	1
my	1
son	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
he	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
merry.	1
	1
15:25	1
Now	1
his	1
elder	1
son	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
heard	1
musick	1
and	1
dancing.	1
	1
15:26	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
meant.	1
	1
15:27	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
is	1
come;	1
and	1
thy	1
father	1
hath	1
killed	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
received	1
him	1
safe	1
and	1
sound.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
in:	1
therefore	1
came	1
his	1
father	1
out,	1
and	1
intreated	1
him.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
he	1
answering	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
Lo,	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
do	1
I	1
serve	1
thee,	1
neither	1
transgressed	1
I	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
thy	1
commandment:	1
and	1
yet	1
thou	1
never	1
gavest	1
me	1
a	1
kid,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
merry	1
with	1
my	1
friends:	1
15:30	1
But	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
thy	1
son	1
was	1
come,	1
which	1
hath	1
devoured	1
thy	1
living	1
with	1
harlots,	1
thou	1
hast	1
killed	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
fatted	1
calf.	1
	1
15:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Son,	1
thou	1
art	1
ever	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
thine.	1
	1
15:32	1
It	1
was	1
meet	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
make	1
merry,	1
and	1
be	1
glad:	1
for	1
this	1
thy	1
brother	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
is	1
alive	1
again;	1
and	1
was	1
lost,	1
and	1
is	1
found.	1
	1
16:1	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
also	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
steward;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
was	1
accused	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
wasted	1
his	1
goods.	1
	1
16:2	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
hear	1
this	1
of	1
thee?	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
thy	1
stewardship;	1
for	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
steward.	1
	1
16:3	1
Then	1
the	1
steward	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
for	1
my	1
lord	1
taketh	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
stewardship:	1
I	1
cannot	1
dig;	1
to	1
beg	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed.	1
	1
16:4	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stewardship,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
their	1
houses.	1
	1
16:5	1
So	1
he	1
called	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
lord's	1
debtors	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
first,	1
How	1
much	1
owest	1
thou	1
unto	1
my	1
lord?	1
	1
16:6	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
oil.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
quickly,	1
and	1
write	1
fifty.	1
	1
16:7	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
another,	1
And	1
how	1
much	1
owest	1
thou?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
An	1
hundred	1
measures	1
of	1
wheat.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Take	1
thy	1
bill,	1
and	1
write	1
fourscore.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
the	1
lord	1
commended	1
the	1
unjust	1
steward,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
wisely:	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
generation	1
wiser	1
than	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Make	1
to	1
yourselves	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
mammon	1
of	1
unrighteousness;	1
that,	1
when	1
ye	1
fail,	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
you	1
into	1
everlasting	1
habitations.	1
	1
16:10	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
least	1
is	1
faithful	1
also	1
in	1
much:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
unjust	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
is	1
unjust	1
also	1
in	1
much.	1
	1
16:11	1
If	1
therefore	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
mammon,	1
who	1
will	1
commit	1
to	1
your	1
trust	1
the	1
true	1
riches?	1
	1
16:12	1
And	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
another	1
man's,	1
who	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
16:13	1
No	1
servant	1
can	1
serve	1
two	1
masters:	1
for	1
either	1
he	1
will	1
hate	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
other;	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
will	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
despise	1
the	1
other.	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
mammon.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also,	1
who	1
were	1
covetous,	1
heard	1
all	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
they	1
derided	1
him.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
justify	1
yourselves	1
before	1
men;	1
but	1
God	1
knoweth	1
your	1
hearts:	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
among	1
men	1
is	1
abomination	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
16:16	1
The	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
were	1
until	1
John:	1
since	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
preached,	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
presseth	1
into	1
it.	1
	1
16:17	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
to	1
pass,	1
than	1
one	1
tittle	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
fail.	1
	1
16:18	1
Whosoever	1
putteth	1
away	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
marrieth	1
another,	1
committeth	1
adultery:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
marrieth	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
committeth	1
adultery.	1
	1
16:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
rich	1
man,	1
which	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
purple	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
and	1
fared	1
sumptuously	1
every	1
day:	1
16:20	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
beggar	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
which	1
was	1
laid	1
at	1
his	1
gate,	1
full	1
of	1
sores,	1
16:21	1
And	1
desiring	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
with	1
the	1
crumbs	1
which	1
fell	1
from	1
the	1
rich	1
man's	1
table:	1
moreover	1
the	1
dogs	1
came	1
and	1
licked	1
his	1
sores.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
beggar	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
angels	1
into	1
Abraham's	1
bosom:	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
also	1
died,	1
and	1
was	1
buried;	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
hell	1
he	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
being	1
in	1
torments,	1
and	1
seeth	1
Abraham	1
afar	1
off,	1
and	1
Lazarus	1
in	1
his	1
bosom.	1
	1
16:24	1
And	1
he	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
Father	1
Abraham,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
send	1
Lazarus,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
dip	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
finger	1
in	1
water,	1
and	1
cool	1
my	1
tongue;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
tormented	1
in	1
this	1
flame.	1
	1
16:25	1
But	1
Abraham	1
said,	1
Son,	1
remember	1
that	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
lifetime	1
receivedst	1
thy	1
good	1
things,	1
and	1
likewise	1
Lazarus	1
evil	1
things:	1
but	1
now	1
he	1
is	1
comforted,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
tormented.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
gulf	1
fixed:	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
would	1
pass	1
from	1
hence	1
to	1
you	1
cannot;	1
neither	1
can	1
they	1
pass	1
to	1
us,	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
from	1
thence.	1
	1
16:27	1
Then	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
therefore,	1
father,	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
house:	1
16:28	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
five	1
brethren;	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
testify	1
unto	1
them,	1
lest	1
they	1
also	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
place	1
of	1
torment.	1
	1
16:29	1
Abraham	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
let	1
them	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
16:30	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Nay,	1
father	1
Abraham:	1
but	1
if	1
one	1
went	1
unto	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
they	1
will	1
repent.	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
they	1
hear	1
not	1
Moses	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
neither	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
though	1
one	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:1	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
but	1
that	1
offences	1
will	1
come:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
him,	1
through	1
whom	1
they	1
come!	1
	1
17:2	1
It	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
a	1
millstone	1
were	1
hanged	1
about	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
cast	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
offend	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
ones.	1
	1
17:3	1
Take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves:	1
If	1
thy	1
brother	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee,	1
rebuke	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
repent,	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
trespass	1
against	1
thee	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
seven	1
times	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
turn	1
again	1
to	1
thee,	1
saying,	1
I	1
repent;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
forgive	1
him.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Increase	1
our	1
faith.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
faith	1
as	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
ye	1
might	1
say	1
unto	1
this	1
sycamine	1
tree,	1
Be	1
thou	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
root,	1
and	1
be	1
thou	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
obey	1
you.	1
	1
17:7	1
But	1
which	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
servant	1
plowing	1
or	1
feeding	1
cattle,	1
will	1
say	1
unto	1
him	1
by	1
and	1
by,	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
field,	1
Go	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
meat?	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
rather	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Make	1
ready	1
wherewith	1
I	1
may	1
sup,	1
and	1
gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
serve	1
me,	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunken;	1
and	1
afterward	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
and	1
drink?	1
	1
17:9	1
Doth	1
he	1
thank	1
that	1
servant	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
commanded	1
him?	1
I	1
trow	1
not.	1
	1
17:10	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
commanded	1
you,	1
say,	1
We	1
are	1
unprofitable	1
servants:	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
that	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Samaria	1
and	1
Galilee.	1
	1
17:12	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
village,	1
there	1
met	1
him	1
ten	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
lepers,	1
which	1
stood	1
afar	1
off:	1
17:13	1
And	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus,	1
Master,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Go	1
shew	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
the	1
priests.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
they	1
were	1
cleansed.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
healed,	1
turned	1
back,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
glorified	1
God,	1
17:16	1
And	1
fell	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
giving	1
him	1
thanks:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Samaritan.	1
	1
17:17	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said,	1
Were	1
there	1
not	1
ten	1
cleansed?	1
but	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
nine?	1
	1
17:18	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
found	1
that	1
returned	1
to	1
give	1
glory	1
to	1
God,	1
save	1
this	1
stranger.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
go	1
thy	1
way:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
made	1
thee	1
whole.	1
	1
17:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
when	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
come,	1
he	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
cometh	1
not	1
with	1
observation:	1
17:21	1
Neither	1
shall	1
they	1
say,	1
Lo	1
here!	1
or,	1
lo	1
there!	1
for,	1
behold,	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
within	1
you.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
disciples,	1
The	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
it.	1
	1
17:23	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
See	1
here;	1
or,	1
see	1
there:	1
go	1
not	1
after	1
them,	1
nor	1
follow	1
them.	1
	1
17:24	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
lightning,	1
that	1
lighteneth	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
under	1
heaven,	1
shineth	1
unto	1
the	1
other	1
part	1
under	1
heaven;	1
so	1
shall	1
also	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
day.	1
	1
17:25	1
But	1
first	1
must	1
he	1
suffer	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
be	1
rejected	1
of	1
this	1
generation.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Noe,	1
so	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
17:27	1
They	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
married	1
wives,	1
they	1
were	1
given	1
in	1
marriage,	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
Noe	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
ark,	1
and	1
the	1
flood	1
came,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:28	1
Likewise	1
also	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Lot;	1
they	1
did	1
eat,	1
they	1
drank,	1
they	1
bought,	1
they	1
sold,	1
they	1
planted,	1
they	1
builded;	1
17:29	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Lot	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
Sodom	1
it	1
rained	1
fire	1
and	1
brimstone	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
17:30	1
Even	1
thus	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
revealed.	1
	1
17:31	1
In	1
that	1
day,	1
he	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop,	1
and	1
his	1
stuff	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
let	1
him	1
likewise	1
not	1
return	1
back.	1
	1
17:32	1
Remember	1
Lot's	1
wife.	1
	1
17:33	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
seek	1
to	1
save	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
preserve	1
it.	1
	1
17:34	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
in	1
that	1
night	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
men	1
in	1
one	1
bed;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
shall	1
be	1
left.	1
	1
17:35	1
Two	1
women	1
shall	1
be	1
grinding	1
together;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:36	1
Two	1
men	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
the	1
one	1
shall	1
be	1
taken,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
left.	1
	1
17:37	1
And	1
they	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Wheresoever	1
the	1
body	1
is,	1
thither	1
will	1
the	1
eagles	1
be	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
18:1	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
a	1
parable	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
end,	1
that	1
men	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
pray,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
faint;	1
18:2	1
Saying,	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
city	1
a	1
judge,	1
which	1
feared	1
not	1
God,	1
neither	1
regarded	1
man:	1
18:3	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
widow	1
in	1
that	1
city;	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Avenge	1
me	1
of	1
mine	1
adversary.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
while:	1
but	1
afterward	1
he	1
said	1
within	1
himself,	1
Though	1
I	1
fear	1
not	1
God,	1
nor	1
regard	1
man;	1
18:5	1
Yet	1
because	1
this	1
widow	1
troubleth	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
avenge	1
her,	1
lest	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
coming	1
she	1
weary	1
me.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Hear	1
what	1
the	1
unjust	1
judge	1
saith.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
God	1
avenge	1
his	1
own	1
elect,	1
which	1
cry	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
unto	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
bear	1
long	1
with	1
them?	1
	1
18:8	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
avenge	1
them	1
speedily.	1
Nevertheless	1
when	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
he	1
find	1
faith	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
	1
18:9	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
parable	1
unto	1
certain	1
which	1
trusted	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
righteous,	1
and	1
despised	1
others:	1
18:10	1
Two	1
men	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
pray;	1
the	1
one	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
publican.	1
	1
18:11	1
The	1
Pharisee	1
stood	1
and	1
prayed	1
thus	1
with	1
himself,	1
God,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
as	1
other	1
men	1
are,	1
extortioners,	1
unjust,	1
adulterers,	1
or	1
even	1
as	1
this	1
publican.	1
	1
18:12	1
I	1
fast	1
twice	1
in	1
the	1
week,	1
I	1
give	1
tithes	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
possess.	1
	1
18:13	1
And	1
the	1
publican,	1
standing	1
afar	1
off,	1
would	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
unto	1
heaven,	1
but	1
smote	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
saying,	1
God	1
be	1
merciful	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
18:14	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
this	1
man	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
justified	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
exalteth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
abased;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
exalted.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
also	1
infants,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
touch	1
them:	1
but	1
when	1
his	1
disciples	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
rebuked	1
them.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Jesus	1
called	1
them	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
little	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
forbid	1
them	1
not:	1
for	1
of	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:17	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
enter	1
therein.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
ruler	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Good	1
Master,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
inherit	1
eternal	1
life?	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
callest	1
thou	1
me	1
good?	1
none	1
is	1
good,	1
save	1
one,	1
that	1
is,	1
God.	1
	1
18:20	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
commandments,	1
Do	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Do	1
not	1
kill,	1
Do	1
not	1
steal,	1
Do	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Honour	1
thy	1
father	1
and	1
thy	1
mother.	1
	1
18:21	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
All	1
these	1
have	1
I	1
kept	1
from	1
my	1
youth	1
up.	1
	1
18:22	1
Now	1
when	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yet	1
lackest	1
thou	1
one	1
thing:	1
sell	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
distribute	1
unto	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
treasure	1
in	1
heaven:	1
and	1
come,	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
this,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
rich.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
sorrowful,	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
hardly	1
shall	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
riches	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God!	1
18:25	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
camel	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
needle's	1
eye,	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
Who	1
then	1
can	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
impossible	1
with	1
men	1
are	1
possible	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Lo,	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
all,	1
and	1
followed	1
thee.	1
	1
18:29	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
left	1
house,	1
or	1
parents,	1
or	1
brethren,	1
or	1
wife,	1
or	1
children,	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God's	1
sake,	1
18:30	1
Who	1
shall	1
not	1
receive	1
manifold	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
time,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
come	1
life	1
everlasting.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
twelve,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
we	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
by	1
the	1
prophets	1
concerning	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished.	1
	1
18:32	1
For	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
mocked,	1
and	1
spitefully	1
entreated,	1
and	1
spitted	1
on:	1
18:33	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
scourge	1
him,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death:	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
18:34	1
And	1
they	1
understood	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
this	1
saying	1
was	1
hid	1
from	1
them,	1
neither	1
knew	1
they	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken.	1
	1
18:35	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jericho,	1
a	1
certain	1
blind	1
man	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
side	1
begging:	1
18:36	1
And	1
hearing	1
the	1
multitude	1
pass	1
by,	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
	1
18:37	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
him,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
passeth	1
by.	1
	1
18:38	1
And	1
he	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Jesus,	1
thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:39	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
went	1
before	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
hold	1
his	1
peace:	1
but	1
he	1
cried	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
more,	1
Thou	1
son	1
of	1
David,	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
18:40	1
And	1
Jesus	1
stood,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
unto	1
him:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
18:41	1
Saying,	1
What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
unto	1
thee?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
receive	1
my	1
sight.	1
	1
18:42	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Receive	1
thy	1
sight:	1
thy	1
faith	1
hath	1
saved	1
thee.	1
	1
18:43	1
And	1
immediately	1
he	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
glorifying	1
God:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
gave	1
praise	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
Jesus	1
entered	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
Jericho.	1
	1
19:2	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Zacchaeus,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
among	1
the	1
publicans,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
rich.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
see	1
Jesus	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
little	1
of	1
stature.	1
	1
19:4	1
And	1
he	1
ran	1
before,	1
and	1
climbed	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sycomore	1
tree	1
to	1
see	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:5	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Zacchaeus,	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
come	1
down;	1
for	1
to	1
day	1
I	1
must	1
abide	1
at	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
he	1
made	1
haste,	1
and	1
came	1
down,	1
and	1
received	1
him	1
joyfully.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
it,	1
they	1
all	1
murmured,	1
saying,	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
be	1
guest	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
Zacchaeus	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
Behold,	1
Lord,	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
my	1
goods	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
poor;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
any	1
thing	1
from	1
any	1
man	1
by	1
false	1
accusation,	1
I	1
restore	1
him	1
fourfold.	1
	1
19:9	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
salvation	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
house,	1
forsomuch	1
as	1
he	1
also	1
is	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
19:10	1
For	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
lost.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
he	1
added	1
and	1
spake	1
a	1
parable,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
because	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
immediately	1
appear.	1
	1
19:12	1
He	1
said	1
therefore,	1
A	1
certain	1
nobleman	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
to	1
receive	1
for	1
himself	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
to	1
return.	1
	1
19:13	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
his	1
ten	1
servants,	1
and	1
delivered	1
them	1
ten	1
pounds,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Occupy	1
till	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
19:14	1
But	1
his	1
citizens	1
hated	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
a	1
message	1
after	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
us.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
returned,	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
then	1
he	1
commanded	1
these	1
servants	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
unto	1
him,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
money,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
gained	1
by	1
trading.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
first,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Well,	1
thou	1
good	1
servant:	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
faithful	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
little,	1
have	1
thou	1
authority	1
over	1
ten	1
cities.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
thy	1
pound	1
hath	1
gained	1
five	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
likewise	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
thou	1
also	1
over	1
five	1
cities.	1
	1
19:20	1
And	1
another	1
came,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
is	1
thy	1
pound,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
laid	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
napkin:	1
19:21	1
For	1
I	1
feared	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
austere	1
man:	1
thou	1
takest	1
up	1
that	1
thou	1
layedst	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reapest	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
sow.	1
	1
19:22	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Out	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
mouth	1
will	1
I	1
judge	1
thee,	1
thou	1
wicked	1
servant.	1
Thou	1
knewest	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
an	1
austere	1
man,	1
taking	1
up	1
that	1
I	1
laid	1
not	1
down,	1
and	1
reaping	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
sow:	1
19:23	1
Wherefore	1
then	1
gavest	1
not	1
thou	1
my	1
money	1
into	1
the	1
bank,	1
that	1
at	1
my	1
coming	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
required	1
mine	1
own	1
with	1
usury?	1
	1
19:24	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Take	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
pound,	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.	1
	1
19:25	1
(And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
he	1
hath	1
ten	1
pounds.)	1
	1
19:26	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
unto	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
given;	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
not,	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
shall	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
19:27	1
But	1
those	1
mine	1
enemies,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
reign	1
over	1
them,	1
bring	1
hither,	1
and	1
slay	1
them	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
went	1
before,	1
ascending	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
to	1
Bethphage	1
and	1
Bethany,	1
at	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
he	1
sent	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
19:30	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
ye	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
over	1
against	1
you;	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
at	1
your	1
entering	1
ye	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
colt	1
tied,	1
whereon	1
yet	1
never	1
man	1
sat:	1
loose	1
him,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
hither.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
ask	1
you,	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
loose	1
him?	1
thus	1
shall	1
ye	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:32	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
sent	1
went	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
found	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
loosing	1
the	1
colt,	1
the	1
owners	1
thereof	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
loose	1
ye	1
the	1
colt?	1
	1
19:34	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
The	1
Lord	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
they	1
cast	1
their	1
garments	1
upon	1
the	1
colt,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
Jesus	1
thereon.	1
	1
19:36	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
they	1
spread	1
their	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
way.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
nigh,	1
even	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives,	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
began	1
to	1
rejoice	1
and	1
praise	1
God	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mighty	1
works	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen;	1
19:38	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
be	1
the	1
King	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
peace	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
highest.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
multitude	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
rebuke	1
thy	1
disciples.	1
	1
19:40	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
if	1
these	1
should	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
the	1
stones	1
would	1
immediately	1
cry	1
out.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
near,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
wept	1
over	1
it,	1
19:42	1
Saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
hadst	1
known,	1
even	1
thou,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
this	1
thy	1
day,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
belong	1
unto	1
thy	1
peace!	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
are	1
hid	1
from	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
	1
19:43	1
For	1
the	1
days	1
shall	1
come	1
upon	1
thee,	1
that	1
thine	1
enemies	1
shall	1
cast	1
a	1
trench	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
compass	1
thee	1
round,	1
and	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
on	1
every	1
side,	1
19:44	1
And	1
shall	1
lay	1
thee	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
thy	1
children	1
within	1
thee;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
leave	1
in	1
thee	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another;	1
because	1
thou	1
knewest	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
thy	1
visitation.	1
	1
19:45	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
out	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
therein,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
bought;	1
19:46	1
Saying	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
written,	1
My	1
house	1
is	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
prayer:	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
den	1
of	1
thieves.	1
	1
19:47	1
And	1
he	1
taught	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple.	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
sought	1
to	1
destroy	1
him,	1
19:48	1
And	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
what	1
they	1
might	1
do:	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
days,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
20:2	1
And	1
spake	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Tell	1
us,	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
doest	1
thou	1
these	1
things?	1
or	1
who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
gave	1
thee	1
this	1
authority?	1
	1
20:3	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
will	1
also	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
and	1
answer	1
me:	1
20:4	1
The	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
heaven,	1
or	1
of	1
men?	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
they	1
reasoned	1
with	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
If	1
we	1
shall	1
say,	1
From	1
heaven;	1
he	1
will	1
say,	1
Why	1
then	1
believed	1
ye	1
him	1
not?	1
	1
20:6	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
say,	1
Of	1
men;	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
stone	1
us:	1
for	1
they	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
John	1
was	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
they	1
answered,	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
was.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Neither	1
tell	1
I	1
you	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
do	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
20:9	1
Then	1
began	1
he	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
this	1
parable;	1
A	1
certain	1
man	1
planted	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
forth	1
to	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
a	1
far	1
country	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
season	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
the	1
husbandmen,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
give	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard:	1
but	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
beat	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:11	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
another	1
servant:	1
and	1
they	1
beat	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
shamefully,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
away	1
empty.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
sent	1
a	1
third:	1
and	1
they	1
wounded	1
him	1
also,	1
and	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
20:13	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do?	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
my	1
beloved	1
son:	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
they	1
will	1
reverence	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
husbandmen	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
reasoned	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
heir:	1
come,	1
let	1
us	1
kill	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
inheritance	1
may	1
be	1
ours.	1
	1
20:15	1
So	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
killed	1
him.	1
What	1
therefore	1
shall	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
vineyard	1
do	1
unto	1
them?	1
	1
20:16	1
He	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
destroy	1
these	1
husbandmen,	1
and	1
shall	1
give	1
the	1
vineyard	1
to	1
others.	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
said,	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
he	1
beheld	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
then	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
stone	1
which	1
the	1
builders	1
rejected,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner?	1
	1
20:18	1
Whosoever	1
shall	1
fall	1
upon	1
that	1
stone	1
shall	1
be	1
broken;	1
but	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
shall	1
fall,	1
it	1
will	1
grind	1
him	1
to	1
powder.	1
	1
20:19	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
sought	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this	1
parable	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
forth	1
spies,	1
which	1
should	1
feign	1
themselves	1
just	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
that	1
so	1
they	1
might	1
deliver	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
20:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
sayest	1
and	1
teachest	1
rightly,	1
neither	1
acceptest	1
thou	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
any,	1
but	1
teachest	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
truly:	1
20:22	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
unto	1
Caesar,	1
or	1
no?	1
	1
20:23	1
But	1
he	1
perceived	1
their	1
craftiness,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
me?	1
	1
20:24	1
Shew	1
me	1
a	1
penny.	1
Whose	1
image	1
and	1
superscription	1
hath	1
it?	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Caesar's.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Render	1
therefore	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
Caesar's,	1
and	1
unto	1
God	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
God's.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
words	1
before	1
the	1
people:	1
and	1
they	1
marvelled	1
at	1
his	1
answer,	1
and	1
held	1
their	1
peace.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
which	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
resurrection;	1
and	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
20:28	1
Saying,	1
Master,	1
Moses	1
wrote	1
unto	1
us,	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
brother	1
die,	1
having	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
die	1
without	1
children,	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
raise	1
up	1
seed	1
unto	1
his	1
brother.	1
	1
20:29	1
There	1
were	1
therefore	1
seven	1
brethren:	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
took	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
died	1
without	1
children.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
the	1
second	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
died	1
childless.	1
	1
20:31	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
took	1
her;	1
and	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
the	1
seven	1
also:	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
no	1
children,	1
and	1
died.	1
	1
20:32	1
Last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
woman	1
died	1
also.	1
	1
20:33	1
Therefore	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
whose	1
wife	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
she?	1
for	1
seven	1
had	1
her	1
to	1
wife.	1
	1
20:34	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
children	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
marry,	1
and	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:35	1
But	1
they	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
neither	1
marry,	1
nor	1
are	1
given	1
in	1
marriage:	1
20:36	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
die	1
any	1
more:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
equal	1
unto	1
the	1
angels;	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God,	1
being	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
20:37	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
are	1
raised,	1
even	1
Moses	1
shewed	1
at	1
the	1
bush,	1
when	1
he	1
calleth	1
the	1
Lord	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
20:38	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
living:	1
for	1
all	1
live	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
20:39	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
scribes	1
answering	1
said,	1
Master,	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said.	1
	1
20:40	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
they	1
durst	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
20:41	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
How	1
say	1
they	1
that	1
Christ	1
is	1
David's	1
son?	1
20:42	1
And	1
David	1
himself	1
saith	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
The	1
LORD	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
20:43	1
Till	1
I	1
make	1
thine	1
enemies	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
20:44	1
David	1
therefore	1
calleth	1
him	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
he	1
then	1
his	1
son?	1
	1
20:45	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
20:46	1
Beware	1
of	1
the	1
scribes,	1
which	1
desire	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
long	1
robes,	1
and	1
love	1
greetings	1
in	1
the	1
markets,	1
and	1
the	1
highest	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
rooms	1
at	1
feasts;	1
20:47	1
Which	1
devour	1
widows'	1
houses,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
shew	1
make	1
long	1
prayers:	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
receive	1
greater	1
damnation.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
he	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
rich	1
men	1
casting	1
their	1
gifts	1
into	1
the	1
treasury.	1
	1
21:2	1
And	1
he	1
saw	1
also	1
a	1
certain	1
poor	1
widow	1
casting	1
in	1
thither	1
two	1
mites.	1
	1
21:3	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
poor	1
widow	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
21:4	1
For	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
of	1
their	1
abundance	1
cast	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
she	1
of	1
her	1
penury	1
hath	1
cast	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
living	1
that	1
she	1
had.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
as	1
some	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
adorned	1
with	1
goodly	1
stones	1
and	1
gifts,	1
he	1
said,	1
21:6	1
As	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
will	1
come,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
one	1
stone	1
upon	1
another,	1
that	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
thrown	1
down.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
but	1
when	1
shall	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
	1
and	1
what	1
sign	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass?	1
21:8	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Take	1
heed	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
for	1
many	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
draweth	1
near:	1
go	1
ye	1
not	1
therefore	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
21:9	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear	1
of	1
wars	1
and	1
commotions,	1
be	1
not	1
terrified:	1
for	1
these	1
things	1
must	1
first	1
come	1
to	1
pass;	1
but	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
not	1
by	1
and	1
by.	1
	1
21:10	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
Nation	1
shall	1
rise	1
against	1
nation,	1
and	1
kingdom	1
against	1
kingdom:	1
21:11	1
And	1
great	1
earthquakes	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
divers	1
places,	1
and	1
famines,	1
and	1
pestilences;	1
and	1
fearful	1
sights	1
and	1
great	1
signs	1
shall	1
there	1
be	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
21:12	1
But	1
before	1
all	1
these,	1
they	1
shall	1
lay	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
persecute	1
you,	1
delivering	1
you	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
and	1
into	1
prisons,	1
being	1
brought	1
before	1
kings	1
and	1
rulers	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:13	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
turn	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
testimony.	1
	1
21:14	1
Settle	1
it	1
therefore	1
in	1
your	1
hearts,	1
not	1
to	1
meditate	1
before	1
what	1
ye	1
shall	1
answer:	1
21:15	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
mouth	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
all	1
your	1
adversaries	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
gainsay	1
nor	1
resist.	1
	1
21:16	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
betrayed	1
both	1
by	1
parents,	1
and	1
brethren,	1
and	1
kinsfolks,	1
and	1
friends;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
they	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
hated	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
21:18	1
But	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
perish.	1
	1
21:19	1
In	1
your	1
patience	1
possess	1
ye	1
your	1
souls.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
Jerusalem	1
compassed	1
with	1
armies,	1
then	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
desolation	1
thereof	1
is	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:21	1
Then	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Judaea	1
flee	1
to	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it	1
depart	1
out;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
countries	1
enter	1
thereinto.	1
	1
21:22	1
For	1
these	1
be	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
vengeance,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:23	1
But	1
woe	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
give	1
suck,	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
great	1
distress	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
wrath	1
upon	1
this	1
people.	1
	1
21:24	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
fall	1
by	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
away	1
captive	1
into	1
all	1
nations:	1
and	1
Jerusalem	1
shall	1
be	1
trodden	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
stars;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
distress	1
of	1
nations,	1
with	1
perplexity;	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
roaring;	1
21:26	1
Men's	1
hearts	1
failing	1
them	1
for	1
fear,	1
and	1
for	1
looking	1
after	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
coming	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
heaven	1
shall	1
be	1
shaken.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
with	1
power	1
and	1
great	1
glory.	1
	1
21:28	1
And	1
when	1
these	1
things	1
begin	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
then	1
look	1
up,	1
and	1
lift	1
up	1
your	1
heads;	1
for	1
your	1
redemption	1
draweth	1
nigh.	1
	1
21:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
parable;	1
Behold	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trees;	1
21:30	1
When	1
they	1
now	1
shoot	1
forth,	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
that	1
summer	1
is	1
now	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:31	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
when	1
ye	1
see	1
these	1
things	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
know	1
ye	1
that	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
21:32	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
generation	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away,	1
till	1
all	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
21:33	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
shall	1
pass	1
away:	1
but	1
my	1
words	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
away.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves,	1
lest	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
your	1
hearts	1
be	1
overcharged	1
with	1
surfeiting,	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
day	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
unawares.	1
	1
21:35	1
For	1
as	1
a	1
snare	1
shall	1
it	1
come	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
	1
21:36	1
Watch	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
pray	1
always,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
accounted	1
worthy	1
to	1
escape	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
to	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
teaching	1
in	1
the	1
temple;	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
21:38	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
22:1	1
Now	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Passover.	1
	1
22:2	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
sought	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
kill	1
him;	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
22:3	1
Then	1
entered	1
Satan	1
into	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Iscariot,	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
captains,	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
22:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
covenanted	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
money.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
he	1
promised,	1
and	1
sought	1
opportunity	1
to	1
betray	1
him	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
multitude.	1
	1
22:7	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
when	1
the	1
passover	1
must	1
be	1
killed.	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
he	1
sent	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
saying,	1
Go	1
and	1
prepare	1
us	1
the	1
passover,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
eat.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
wilt	1
thou	1
that	1
we	1
prepare?	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
there	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
meet	1
you,	1
bearing	1
a	1
pitcher	1
of	1
water;	1
follow	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
he	1
entereth	1
in.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
goodman	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
The	1
Master	1
saith	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
guestchamber,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
eat	1
the	1
passover	1
with	1
my	1
disciples?	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
large	1
upper	1
room	1
furnished:	1
there	1
make	1
ready.	1
	1
22:13	1
And	1
they	1
went,	1
and	1
found	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
ready	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
was	1
come,	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
the	1
twelve	1
apostles	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:15	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
With	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
eat	1
this	1
passover	1
with	1
you	1
before	1
I	1
suffer:	1
22:16	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take	1
this,	1
and	1
divide	1
it	1
among	1
yourselves:	1
22:18	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
the	1
vine,	1
until	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
shall	1
come.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks,	1
and	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
gave	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
22:20	1
Likewise	1
also	1
the	1
cup	1
after	1
supper,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood,	1
which	1
is	1
shed	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
22:21	1
But,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
truly	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
goeth,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
determined:	1
but	1
woe	1
unto	1
that	1
man	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
is	1
betrayed!	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
enquire	1
among	1
themselves,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
do	1
this	1
thing.	1
	1
22:24	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
strife	1
among	1
them,	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
accounted	1
the	1
greatest.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
exercise	1
lordship	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
exercise	1
authority	1
upon	1
them	1
are	1
called	1
benefactors.	1
	1
22:26	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
greatest	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
younger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
chief,	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
doth	1
serve.	1
	1
22:27	1
For	1
whether	1
is	1
greater,	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat,	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
serveth?	1
	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
sitteth	1
at	1
meat?	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
among	1
you	1
as	1
he	1
that	1
serveth.	1
	1
22:28	1
Ye	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
have	1
continued	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
temptations.	1
	1
22:29	1
And	1
I	1
appoint	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
appointed	1
unto	1
me;	1
22:30	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
at	1
my	1
table	1
in	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
sit	1
on	1
thrones	1
judging	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
22:31	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
Simon,	1
Simon,	1
behold,	1
Satan	1
hath	1
desired	1
to	1
have	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
sift	1
you	1
as	1
wheat:	1
22:32	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
prayed	1
for	1
thee,	1
that	1
thy	1
faith	1
fail	1
not:	1
and	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
converted,	1
strengthen	1
thy	1
brethren.	1
	1
22:33	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
thee,	1
both	1
into	1
prison,	1
and	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
22:34	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Peter,	1
the	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow	1
this	1
day,	1
before	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
thrice	1
deny	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
me.	1
	1
22:35	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
without	1
purse,	1
and	1
scrip,	1
and	1
shoes,	1
lacked	1
ye	1
any	1
thing?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Nothing.	1
	1
22:36	1
Then	1
said	1
he	1
unto	1
them,	1
But	1
now,	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
purse,	1
let	1
him	1
take	1
it,	1
and	1
likewise	1
his	1
scrip:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
no	1
sword,	1
let	1
him	1
sell	1
his	1
garment,	1
and	1
buy	1
one.	1
	1
22:37	1
For	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
this	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
must	1
yet	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
me,	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
reckoned	1
among	1
the	1
transgressors:	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
me	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
	1
22:38	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
here	1
are	1
two	1
swords.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
enough.	1
	1
22:39	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
went,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
wont,	1
to	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
also	1
followed	1
him.	1
	1
22:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Pray	1
that	1
ye	1
enter	1
not	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:41	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
them	1
about	1
a	1
stone's	1
cast,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
22:42	1
Saying,	1
Father,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
willing,	1
remove	1
this	1
cup	1
from	1
me:	1
nevertheless	1
not	1
my	1
will,	1
but	1
thine,	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
22:43	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
an	1
angel	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
heaven,	1
strengthening	1
him.	1
	1
22:44	1
And	1
being	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
he	1
prayed	1
more	1
earnestly:	1
and	1
his	1
sweat	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
great	1
drops	1
of	1
blood	1
falling	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
22:45	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
prayer,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
sleeping	1
for	1
sorrow,	1
22:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
sleep	1
ye?	1
rise	1
and	1
pray,	1
lest	1
ye	1
enter	1
into	1
temptation.	1
	1
22:47	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
behold	1
a	1
multitude,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Judas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
went	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
drew	1
near	1
unto	1
Jesus	1
to	1
kiss	1
him.	1
	1
22:48	1
But	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Judas,	1
betrayest	1
thou	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
kiss?	1
	1
22:49	1
When	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
about	1
him	1
saw	1
what	1
would	1
follow,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shall	1
we	1
smite	1
with	1
the	1
sword?	1
22:50	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
smote	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
	1
22:51	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Suffer	1
ye	1
thus	1
far.	1
And	1
he	1
touched	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
22:52	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
and	1
captains	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
which	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
Be	1
ye	1
come	1
out,	1
as	1
against	1
a	1
thief,	1
with	1
swords	1
and	1
staves?	1
	1
22:53	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
daily	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
ye	1
stretched	1
forth	1
no	1
hands	1
against	1
me:	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
hour,	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
darkness.	1
	1
22:54	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
him,	1
and	1
led	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
house.	1
And	1
Peter	1
followed	1
afar	1
off.	1
	1
22:55	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
were	1
set	1
down	1
together,	1
Peter	1
sat	1
down	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
22:56	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
maid	1
beheld	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
earnestly	1
looked	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
also	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
22:57	1
And	1
he	1
denied	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Woman,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
22:58	1
And	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
another	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
also	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
22:59	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
one	1
hour	1
after	1
another	1
confidently	1
affirmed,	1
saying,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
fellow	1
also	1
was	1
with	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
22:60	1
And	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Man,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest.	1
And	1
immediately,	1
while	1
he	1
yet	1
spake,	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
22:61	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
turned,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
Peter.	1
And	1
Peter	1
remembered	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
the	1
cock	1
crow,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
deny	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
22:62	1
And	1
Peter	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
wept	1
bitterly.	1
	1
22:63	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
that	1
held	1
Jesus	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
smote	1
him.	1
	1
22:64	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
blindfolded	1
him,	1
they	1
struck	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Prophesy,	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
smote	1
thee?	1
	1
22:65	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
blasphemously	1
spake	1
they	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:66	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
into	1
their	1
council,	1
saying,	1
22:67	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
Christ?	1
tell	1
us.	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe:	1
22:68	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
also	1
ask	1
you,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
me,	1
nor	1
let	1
me	1
go.	1
	1
22:69	1
Hereafter	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
sit	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
22:70	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
all,	1
Art	1
thou	1
then	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
22:71	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
What	1
need	1
we	1
any	1
further	1
witness?	1
for	1
we	1
ourselves	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
arose,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
unto	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
We	1
found	1
this	1
fellow	1
perverting	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
forbidding	1
to	1
give	1
tribute	1
to	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
Christ	1
a	1
King.	1
	1
23:3	1
And	1
Pilate	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
it.	1
	1
23:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
23:5	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
fierce,	1
saying,	1
He	1
stirreth	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
teaching	1
throughout	1
all	1
Jewry,	1
beginning	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
23:6	1
When	1
Pilate	1
heard	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
asked	1
whether	1
the	1
man	1
were	1
a	1
Galilaean.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
belonged	1
unto	1
Herod's	1
jurisdiction,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
Herod,	1
who	1
himself	1
also	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
	1
23:8	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
saw	1
Jesus,	1
he	1
was	1
exceeding	1
glad:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
desirous	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
season,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
some	1
miracle	1
done	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
23:9	1
Then	1
he	1
questioned	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
many	1
words;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
him	1
nothing.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
scribes	1
stood	1
and	1
vehemently	1
accused	1
him.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
Herod	1
with	1
his	1
men	1
of	1
war	1
set	1
him	1
at	1
nought,	1
and	1
mocked	1
him,	1
and	1
arrayed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
gorgeous	1
robe,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
again	1
to	1
Pilate.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
Pilate	1
and	1
Herod	1
were	1
made	1
friends	1
together:	1
for	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
enmity	1
between	1
themselves.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
23:14	1
Said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
have	1
brought	1
this	1
man	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
perverteth	1
the	1
people:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
I,	1
having	1
examined	1
him	1
before	1
you,	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
this	1
man	1
touching	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
accuse	1
him:	1
23:15	1
No,	1
nor	1
yet	1
Herod:	1
for	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
lo,	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
done	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
release	1
him.	1
	1
23:17	1
(For	1
of	1
necessity	1
he	1
must	1
release	1
one	1
unto	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
feast.)	1
23:18	1
And	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
saying,	1
Away	1
with	1
this	1
man,	1
and	1
release	1
unto	1
us	1
Barabbas:	1
23:19	1
(Who	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
sedition	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
for	1
murder,	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.)	1
	1
23:20	1
Pilate	1
therefore,	1
willing	1
to	1
release	1
Jesus,	1
spake	1
again	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
they	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
23:22	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Why,	1
what	1
evil	1
hath	1
he	1
done?	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him:	1
I	1
will	1
therefore	1
chastise	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
instant	1
with	1
loud	1
voices,	1
requiring	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
prevailed.	1
	1
23:24	1
And	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
sentence	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
they	1
required.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
released	1
unto	1
them	1
him	1
that	1
for	1
sedition	1
and	1
murder	1
was	1
cast	1
into	1
prison,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
desired;	1
but	1
he	1
delivered	1
Jesus	1
to	1
their	1
will.	1
	1
23:26	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
away,	1
they	1
laid	1
hold	1
upon	1
one	1
Simon,	1
a	1
Cyrenian,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
on	1
him	1
they	1
laid	1
the	1
cross,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bear	1
it	1
after	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:27	1
And	1
there	1
followed	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
of	1
women,	1
which	1
also	1
bewailed	1
and	1
lamented	1
him.	1
	1
23:28	1
But	1
Jesus	1
turning	1
unto	1
them	1
said,	1
Daughters	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
weep	1
not	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
weep	1
for	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
children.	1
	1
23:29	1
For,	1
behold,	1
the	1
days	1
are	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
shall	1
say,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
the	1
barren,	1
and	1
the	1
wombs	1
that	1
never	1
bare,	1
and	1
the	1
paps	1
which	1
never	1
gave	1
suck.	1
	1
23:30	1
Then	1
shall	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
mountains,	1
Fall	1
on	1
us;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hills,	1
Cover	1
us.	1
	1
23:31	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
these	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
tree,	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
dry?	1
	1
23:32	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
two	1
other,	1
malefactors,	1
led	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
23:33	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Calvary,	1
there	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
malefactors,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
left.	1
	1
23:34	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Father,	1
forgive	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
do.	1
And	1
they	1
parted	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
cast	1
lots.	1
	1
23:35	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
stood	1
beholding.	1
And	1
the	1
rulers	1
also	1
with	1
them	1
derided	1
him,	1
saying,	1
He	1
saved	1
others;	1
let	1
him	1
save	1
himself,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
Christ,	1
the	1
chosen	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:36	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
also	1
mocked	1
him,	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
offering	1
him	1
vinegar,	1
23:37	1
And	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
save	1
thyself.	1
	1
23:38	1
And	1
a	1
superscription	1
also	1
was	1
written	1
over	1
him	1
in	1
letters	1
of	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin,	1
and	1
Hebrew,	1
THIS	1
IS	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
23:39	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
malefactors	1
which	1
were	1
hanged	1
railed	1
on	1
him,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
Christ,	1
save	1
thyself	1
and	1
us.	1
	1
23:40	1
But	1
the	1
other	1
answering	1
rebuked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Dost	1
not	1
thou	1
fear	1
God,	1
seeing	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
condemnation?	1
	1
23:41	1
And	1
we	1
indeed	1
justly;	1
for	1
we	1
receive	1
the	1
due	1
reward	1
of	1
our	1
deeds:	1
but	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done	1
nothing	1
amiss.	1
	1
23:42	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
remember	1
me	1
when	1
thou	1
comest	1
into	1
thy	1
kingdom.	1
	1
23:43	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
To	1
day	1
shalt	1
thou	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
paradise.	1
	1
23:44	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
darkness	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
until	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
23:45	1
And	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
darkened,	1
and	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
was	1
rent	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
23:46	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
had	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
he	1
said,	1
Father,	1
into	1
thy	1
hands	1
I	1
commend	1
my	1
spirit:	1
and	1
having	1
said	1
thus,	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
23:47	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
centurion	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
he	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Certainly	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
righteous	1
man.	1
	1
23:48	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
that	1
sight,	1
beholding	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
done,	1
smote	1
their	1
breasts,	1
and	1
returned.	1
	1
23:49	1
And	1
all	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
that	1
followed	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
stood	1
afar	1
off,	1
beholding	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
23:50	1
And,	1
behold,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Joseph,	1
a	1
counsellor;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
just:	1
23:51	1
(The	1
same	1
had	1
not	1
consented	1
to	1
the	1
counsel	1
and	1
deed	1
of	1
them;)	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
who	1
also	1
himself	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
23:52	1
This	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
Pilate,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
23:53	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
it	1
in	1
linen,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
was	1
hewn	1
in	1
stone,	1
wherein	1
never	1
man	1
before	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:54	1
And	1
that	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
and	1
the	1
sabbath	1
drew	1
on.	1
	1
23:55	1
And	1
the	1
women	1
also,	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
followed	1
after,	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
how	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
laid.	1
	1
23:56	1
And	1
they	1
returned,	1
and	1
prepared	1
spices	1
and	1
ointments;	1
and	1
rested	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment.	1
	1
24:1	1
Now	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
bringing	1
the	1
spices	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
prepared,	1
and	1
certain	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
stone	1
rolled	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
24:3	1
And	1
they	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
not	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
24:4	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
much	1
perplexed	1
thereabout,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
shining	1
garments:	1
24:5	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
and	1
bowed	1
down	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
seek	1
ye	1
the	1
living	1
among	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
24:6	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
but	1
is	1
risen:	1
remember	1
how	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
you	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
24:7	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
delivered	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
sinful	1
men,	1
and	1
be	1
crucified,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
24:8	1
And	1
they	1
remembered	1
his	1
words,	1
24:9	1
And	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
told	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
eleven,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
	1
24:10	1
It	1
was	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
and	1
Joanna,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
James,	1
and	1
other	1
women	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
which	1
told	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
24:11	1
And	1
their	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
idle	1
tales,	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
24:12	1
Then	1
arose	1
Peter,	1
and	1
ran	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
and	1
stooping	1
down,	1
he	1
beheld	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
laid	1
by	1
themselves,	1
and	1
departed,	1
wondering	1
in	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
	1
24:13	1
And,	1
behold,	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
to	1
a	1
village	1
called	1
Emmaus,	1
which	1
was	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
about	1
threescore	1
furlongs.	1
	1
24:14	1
And	1
they	1
talked	1
together	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
happened.	1
	1
24:15	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
they	1
communed	1
together	1
and	1
reasoned,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
drew	1
near,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:16	1
But	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
holden	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
	1
24:17	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
communications	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
ye	1
walk,	1
and	1
are	1
sad?	1
	1
24:18	1
And	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Cleopas,	1
answering	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
only	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
hast	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
there	1
in	1
these	1
days?	1
	1
24:19	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
things?	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Concerning	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
prophet	1
mighty	1
in	1
deed	1
and	1
word	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people:	1
24:20	1
And	1
how	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
our	1
rulers	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
condemned	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
have	1
crucified	1
him.	1
	1
24:21	1
But	1
we	1
trusted	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
he	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
redeemed	1
Israel:	1
and	1
beside	1
all	1
this,	1
to	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
since	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
24:22	1
Yea,	1
and	1
certain	1
women	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
company	1
made	1
us	1
astonished,	1
which	1
were	1
early	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre;	1
24:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
not	1
his	1
body,	1
they	1
came,	1
saying,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
seen	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
angels,	1
which	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
alive.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
us	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
even	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
women	1
had	1
said:	1
but	1
him	1
they	1
saw	1
not.	1
	1
24:25	1
Then	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
O	1
fools,	1
and	1
slow	1
of	1
heart	1
to	1
believe	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
spoken:	1
24:26	1
Ought	1
not	1
Christ	1
to	1
have	1
suffered	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
his	1
glory?	1
	1
24:27	1
And	1
beginning	1
at	1
Moses	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets,	1
he	1
expounded	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
scriptures	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
himself.	1
	1
24:28	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
village,	1
whither	1
they	1
went:	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
further.	1
	1
24:29	1
But	1
they	1
constrained	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Abide	1
with	1
us:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
toward	1
evening,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
far	1
spent.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
24:30	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
at	1
meat	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
blessed	1
it,	1
and	1
brake,	1
and	1
gave	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
24:31	1
And	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
vanished	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
24:32	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Did	1
not	1
our	1
heart	1
burn	1
within	1
us,	1
while	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
us	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
opened	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
scriptures?	1
	1
24:33	1
And	1
they	1
rose	1
up	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
found	1
the	1
eleven	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
them,	1
24:34	1
Saying,	1
The	1
Lord	1
is	1
risen	1
indeed,	1
and	1
hath	1
appeared	1
to	1
Simon.	1
	1
24:35	1
And	1
they	1
told	1
what	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread.	1
	1
24:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
thus	1
spake,	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
24:37	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
terrified	1
and	1
affrighted,	1
and	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
spirit.	1
	1
24:38	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
are	1
ye	1
troubled?	1
and	1
why	1
do	1
thoughts	1
arise	1
in	1
your	1
hearts?	1
	1
24:39	1
Behold	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
feet,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
myself:	1
handle	1
me,	1
and	1
see;	1
for	1
a	1
spirit	1
hath	1
not	1
flesh	1
and	1
bones,	1
as	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
have.	1
	1
24:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
shewed	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
24:41	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
yet	1
believed	1
not	1
for	1
joy,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
here	1
any	1
meat?	1
	1
24:42	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
broiled	1
fish,	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
honeycomb.	1
	1
24:43	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
eat	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
24:44	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
I	1
spake	1
unto	1
you,	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
yet	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
were	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
psalms,	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
24:45	1
Then	1
opened	1
he	1
their	1
understanding,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
understand	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
24:46	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Thus	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
behoved	1
Christ	1
to	1
suffer,	1
and	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
the	1
third	1
day:	1
24:47	1
And	1
that	1
repentance	1
and	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
should	1
be	1
preached	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
beginning	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
24:48	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
24:49	1
And,	1
behold,	1
I	1
send	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
upon	1
you:	1
but	1
tarry	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
until	1
ye	1
be	1
endued	1
with	1
power	1
from	1
on	1
high.	1
	1
24:50	1
And	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
and	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
blessed	1
them.	1
	1
24:51	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
while	1
he	1
blessed	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
parted	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
carried	1
up	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
24:52	1
And	1
they	1
worshipped	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
great	1
joy:	1
24:53	1
And	1
were	1
continually	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
praising	1
and	1
blessing	1
God.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Gospel	1
According	1
to	1
Saint	1
John	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
the	1
Word,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
with	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
God.	1
	1
1:2	1
The	1
same	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
1:3	1
All	1
things	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
him;	1
and	1
without	1
him	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
thing	1
made	1
that	1
was	1
made.	1
	1
1:4	1
In	1
him	1
was	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
life	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
1:5	1
And	1
the	1
light	1
shineth	1
in	1
darkness;	1
and	1
the	1
darkness	1
comprehended	1
it	1
not.	1
	1
1:6	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
sent	1
from	1
God,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
John.	1
	1
1:7	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
for	1
a	1
witness,	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
Light,	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
1:8	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
Light,	1
but	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
that	1
Light.	1
	1
1:9	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
Light,	1
which	1
lighteth	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
cometh	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:10	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
knew	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:11	1
He	1
came	1
unto	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
received	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
1:12	1
But	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
received	1
him,	1
to	1
them	1
gave	1
he	1
power	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
his	1
name:	1
1:13	1
Which	1
were	1
born,	1
not	1
of	1
blood,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
man,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:14	1
And	1
the	1
Word	1
was	1
made	1
flesh,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
among	1
us,	1
(and	1
we	1
beheld	1
his	1
glory,	1
the	1
glory	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
of	1
the	1
Father,)	1
full	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
1:15	1
John	1
bare	1
witness	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
This	1
was	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
spake,	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
of	1
his	1
fulness	1
have	1
all	1
we	1
received,	1
and	1
grace	1
for	1
grace.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
given	1
by	1
Moses,	1
but	1
grace	1
and	1
truth	1
came	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:18	1
No	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
God	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
hath	1
declared	1
him.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
John,	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
sent	1
priests	1
and	1
Levites	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
	1
1:20	1
And	1
he	1
confessed,	1
and	1
denied	1
not;	1
but	1
confessed,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:21	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
then?	1
Art	1
thou	1
Elias?	1
And	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
Art	1
thou	1
that	1
prophet?	1
And	1
he	1
answered,	1
No.	1
	1
1:22	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
sent	1
us.	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
thyself?	1
	1
1:23	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
one	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
Make	1
straight	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
said	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees.	1
	1
1:25	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Why	1
baptizest	1
thou	1
then,	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
not	1
that	1
Christ,	1
nor	1
Elias,	1
neither	1
that	1
prophet?	1
	1
1:26	1
John	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
baptize	1
with	1
water:	1
but	1
there	1
standeth	1
one	1
among	1
you,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not;	1
1:27	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
who	1
coming	1
after	1
me	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoe's	1
latchet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
unloose.	1
	1
1:28	1
These	1
things	1
were	1
done	1
in	1
Bethabara	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
where	1
John	1
was	1
baptizing.	1
	1
1:29	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
John	1
seeth	1
Jesus	1
coming	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
taketh	1
away	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
1:30	1
This	1
is	1
he	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
said,	1
After	1
me	1
cometh	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
preferred	1
before	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
1:31	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
to	1
Israel,	1
therefore	1
am	1
I	1
come	1
baptizing	1
with	1
water.	1
	1
1:32	1
And	1
John	1
bare	1
record,	1
saying,	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending	1
from	1
heaven	1
like	1
a	1
dove,	1
and	1
it	1
abode	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
1:33	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
not:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
baptize	1
with	1
water,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Upon	1
whom	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
the	1
Spirit	1
descending,	1
and	1
remaining	1
on	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
baptizeth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
1:34	1
And	1
I	1
saw,	1
and	1
bare	1
record	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:35	1
Again	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
after	1
John	1
stood,	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
disciples;	1
1:36	1
And	1
looking	1
upon	1
Jesus	1
as	1
he	1
walked,	1
he	1
saith,	1
Behold	1
the	1
Lamb	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
1:37	1
And	1
the	1
two	1
disciples	1
heard	1
him	1
speak,	1
and	1
they	1
followed	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:38	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
turned,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
following,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
What	1
seek	1
ye?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
(which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
Master,)	1
where	1
dwellest	1
thou?	1
	1
1:39	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
They	1
came	1
and	1
saw	1
where	1
he	1
dwelt,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
tenth	1
hour.	1
	1
1:40	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
which	1
heard	1
John	1
speak,	1
and	1
followed	1
him,	1
was	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother.	1
	1
1:41	1
He	1
first	1
findeth	1
his	1
own	1
brother	1
Simon,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
the	1
Messias,	1
which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
the	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:42	1
And	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
Jesus.	1
And	1
when	1
Jesus	1
beheld	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
Simon	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jona:	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
called	1
Cephas,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
A	1
stone.	1
	1
1:43	1
The	1
day	1
following	1
Jesus	1
would	1
go	1
forth	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
findeth	1
Philip,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
1:44	1
Now	1
Philip	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Peter.	1
	1
1:45	1
Philip	1
findeth	1
Nathanael,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
him,	1
of	1
whom	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets,	1
did	1
write,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph.	1
	1
1:46	1
And	1
Nathanael	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Can	1
there	1
any	1
good	1
thing	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Nazareth?	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
1:47	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
Nathanael	1
coming	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saith	1
of	1
him,	1
Behold	1
an	1
Israelite	1
indeed,	1
in	1
whom	1
is	1
no	1
guile!	1
	1
1:48	1
Nathanael	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Whence	1
knowest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Before	1
that	1
Philip	1
called	1
thee,	1
when	1
thou	1
wast	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee.	1
	1
1:49	1
Nathanael	1
answered	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
1:50	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Because	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
under	1
the	1
fig	1
tree,	1
believest	1
thou?	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
greater	1
things	1
than	1
these.	1
	1
1:51	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Hereafter	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
heaven	1
open,	1
and	1
the	1
angels	1
of	1
God	1
ascending	1
and	1
descending	1
upon	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
marriage	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee;	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
was	1
there:	1
2:2	1
And	1
both	1
Jesus	1
was	1
called,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples,	1
to	1
the	1
marriage.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
wanted	1
wine,	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
wine.	1
	1
2:4	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee?	1
mine	1
hour	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
2:5	1
His	1
mother	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
servants,	1
Whatsoever	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
you,	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
2:6	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
set	1
there	1
six	1
waterpots	1
of	1
stone,	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
purifying	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
containing	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
firkins	1
apiece.	1
	1
2:7	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Fill	1
the	1
waterpots	1
with	1
water.	1
And	1
they	1
filled	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
brim.	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Draw	1
out	1
now,	1
and	1
bear	1
unto	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast.	1
And	1
they	1
bare	1
it.	1
	1
2:9	1
When	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
had	1
tasted	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
wine,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
whence	1
it	1
was:	1
(but	1
the	1
servants	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
water	1
knew;)	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
called	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
2:10	1
And	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Every	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
doth	1
set	1
forth	1
good	1
wine;	1
and	1
when	1
men	1
have	1
well	1
drunk,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
worse:	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
kept	1
the	1
good	1
wine	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
2:11	1
This	1
beginning	1
of	1
miracles	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
manifested	1
forth	1
his	1
glory;	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
2:12	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
he,	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
brethren,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples:	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
there	1
not	1
many	1
days.	1
	1
2:13	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
2:14	1
And	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
those	1
that	1
sold	1
oxen	1
and	1
sheep	1
and	1
doves,	1
and	1
the	1
changers	1
of	1
money	1
sitting:	1
2:15	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
scourge	1
of	1
small	1
cords,	1
he	1
drove	1
them	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
the	1
oxen;	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
changers'	1
money,	1
and	1
overthrew	1
the	1
tables;	1
2:16	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
sold	1
doves,	1
Take	1
these	1
things	1
hence;	1
make	1
not	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
an	1
house	1
of	1
merchandise.	1
	1
2:17	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
written,	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
thine	1
house	1
hath	1
eaten	1
me	1
up.	1
	1
2:18	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
unto	1
us,	1
seeing	1
that	1
thou	1
doest	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
2:19	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Destroy	1
this	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
it	1
up.	1
	1
2:20	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Forty	1
and	1
six	1
years	1
was	1
this	1
temple	1
in	1
building,	1
and	1
wilt	1
thou	1
rear	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
three	1
days?	1
	1
2:21	1
But	1
he	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
his	1
body.	1
	1
2:22	1
When	1
therefore	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
his	1
disciples	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
believed	1
the	1
scripture,	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said.	1
	1
2:23	1
Now	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
passover,	1
in	1
the	1
feast	1
day,	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
his	1
name,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
2:24	1
But	1
Jesus	1
did	1
not	1
commit	1
himself	1
unto	1
them,	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
men,	1
2:25	1
And	1
needed	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
testify	1
of	1
man:	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
man.	1
	1
3:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
named	1
Nicodemus,	1
a	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
3:2	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
teacher	1
come	1
from	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
these	1
miracles	1
that	1
thou	1
doest,	1
except	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
3:3	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
again,	1
he	1
cannot	1
see	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:4	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
old?	1
can	1
he	1
enter	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
into	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
and	1
be	1
born?	1
	1
3:5	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Except	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
born	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
he	1
cannot	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:6	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
is	1
flesh;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
spirit.	1
	1
3:7	1
Marvel	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
born	1
again.	1
	1
3:8	1
The	1
wind	1
bloweth	1
where	1
it	1
listeth,	1
and	1
thou	1
hearest	1
the	1
sound	1
thereof,	1
but	1
canst	1
not	1
tell	1
whence	1
it	1
cometh,	1
and	1
whither	1
it	1
goeth:	1
so	1
is	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
3:9	1
Nicodemus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
can	1
these	1
things	1
be?	1
3:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
master	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
knowest	1
not	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
3:11	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
We	1
speak	1
that	1
we	1
do	1
know,	1
and	1
testify	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen;	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
not	1
our	1
witness.	1
	1
3:12	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
earthly	1
things,	1
and	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe,	1
if	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
heavenly	1
things?	1
	1
3:13	1
And	1
no	1
man	1
hath	1
ascended	1
up	1
to	1
heaven,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
even	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:14	1
And	1
as	1
Moses	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
serpent	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
even	1
so	1
must	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
be	1
lifted	1
up:	1
3:15	1
That	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
3:16	1
For	1
God	1
so	1
loved	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
should	1
not	1
perish,	1
but	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
3:17	1
For	1
God	1
sent	1
not	1
his	1
Son	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
condemn	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
through	1
him	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:18	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
is	1
not	1
condemned:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
is	1
condemned	1
already,	1
because	1
he	1
hath	1
not	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
begotten	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:19	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
condemnation,	1
that	1
light	1
is	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
men	1
loved	1
darkness	1
rather	1
than	1
light,	1
because	1
their	1
deeds	1
were	1
evil.	1
	1
3:20	1
For	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil	1
hateth	1
the	1
light,	1
neither	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
his	1
deeds	1
should	1
be	1
reproved.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
doeth	1
truth	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
his	1
deeds	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
wrought	1
in	1
God.	1
	1
3:22	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
tarried	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
John	1
also	1
was	1
baptizing	1
in	1
Aenon	1
near	1
to	1
Salim,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
water	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
3:24	1
For	1
John	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
cast	1
into	1
prison.	1
	1
3:25	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
question	1
between	1
some	1
of	1
John's	1
disciples	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
about	1
purifying.	1
	1
3:26	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
thee	1
beyond	1
Jordan,	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
barest	1
witness,	1
behold,	1
the	1
same	1
baptizeth,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
3:27	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
can	1
receive	1
nothing,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
3:28	1
Ye	1
yourselves	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Christ,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sent	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
3:29	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
the	1
bride	1
is	1
the	1
bridegroom:	1
but	1
the	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom,	1
which	1
standeth	1
and	1
heareth	1
him,	1
rejoiceth	1
greatly	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
bridegroom's	1
voice:	1
this	1
my	1
joy	1
therefore	1
is	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:30	1
He	1
must	1
increase,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
decrease.	1
	1
3:31	1
He	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
above	1
is	1
above	1
all:	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
earthly,	1
and	1
speaketh	1
of	1
the	1
earth:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
heaven	1
is	1
above	1
all.	1
	1
3:32	1
And	1
what	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
and	1
heard,	1
that	1
he	1
testifieth;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
receiveth	1
his	1
testimony.	1
	1
3:33	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
received	1
his	1
testimony	1
hath	1
set	1
to	1
his	1
seal	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
3:34	1
For	1
he	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
sent	1
speaketh	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
God	1
giveth	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
by	1
measure	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:35	1
The	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
hath	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
3:36	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
life;	1
but	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
abideth	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
4:1	1
When	1
therefore	1
the	1
LORD	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
made	1
and	1
baptized	1
more	1
disciples	1
than	1
John,	1
4:2	1
(Though	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
baptized	1
not,	1
but	1
his	1
disciples,)	1
4:3	1
He	1
left	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:4	1
And	1
he	1
must	1
needs	1
go	1
through	1
Samaria.	1
	1
4:5	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Sychar,	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
parcel	1
of	1
ground	1
that	1
Jacob	1
gave	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Joseph.	1
	1
4:6	1
Now	1
Jacob's	1
well	1
was	1
there.	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
being	1
wearied	1
with	1
his	1
journey,	1
sat	1
thus	1
on	1
the	1
well:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour.	1
	1
4:7	1
There	1
cometh	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
to	1
draw	1
water:	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink.	1
	1
4:8	1
(For	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
unto	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
buy	1
meat.)	1
	1
4:9	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
Jew,	1
askest	1
drink	1
of	1
me,	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
Samaria?	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
no	1
dealings	1
with	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
4:10	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
If	1
thou	1
knewest	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
saith	1
to	1
thee,	1
Give	1
me	1
to	1
drink;	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
have	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
4:11	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
draw	1
with,	1
and	1
the	1
well	1
is	1
deep:	1
from	1
whence	1
then	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
living	1
water?	1
4:12	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Jacob,	1
which	1
gave	1
us	1
the	1
well,	1
and	1
drank	1
thereof	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
his	1
cattle?	1
	1
4:13	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
this	1
water	1
shall	1
thirst	1
again:	1
4:14	1
But	1
whosoever	1
drinketh	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst;	1
but	1
the	1
water	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
well	1
of	1
water	1
springing	1
up	1
into	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
4:15	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
give	1
me	1
this	1
water,	1
that	1
I	1
thirst	1
not,	1
neither	1
come	1
hither	1
to	1
draw.	1
	1
4:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Go,	1
call	1
thy	1
husband,	1
and	1
come	1
hither.	1
	1
4:17	1
The	1
woman	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband.	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
well	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
husband:	1
4:18	1
For	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
five	1
husbands;	1
and	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
now	1
hast	1
is	1
not	1
thy	1
husband:	1
in	1
that	1
saidst	1
thou	1
truly.	1
	1
4:19	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
4:20	1
Our	1
fathers	1
worshipped	1
in	1
this	1
mountain;	1
and	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
men	1
ought	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
4:21	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
when	1
ye	1
shall	1
neither	1
in	1
this	1
mountain,	1
nor	1
yet	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
worship	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
4:22	1
Ye	1
worship	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
what:	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
worship:	1
for	1
salvation	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
4:23	1
But	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
true	1
worshippers	1
shall	1
worship	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth:	1
for	1
the	1
Father	1
seeketh	1
such	1
to	1
worship	1
him.	1
	1
4:24	1
God	1
is	1
a	1
Spirit:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
worship	1
him	1
must	1
worship	1
him	1
in	1
spirit	1
and	1
in	1
truth.	1
	1
4:25	1
The	1
woman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Messias	1
cometh,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Christ:	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
4:26	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
that	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
4:27	1
And	1
upon	1
this	1
came	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
that	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
woman:	1
yet	1
no	1
man	1
said,	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
or,	1
Why	1
talkest	1
thou	1
with	1
her?	1
	1
4:28	1
The	1
woman	1
then	1
left	1
her	1
waterpot,	1
and	1
went	1
her	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
saith	1
to	1
the	1
men,	1
4:29	1
Come,	1
see	1
a	1
man,	1
which	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
Christ?	1
	1
4:30	1
Then	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
4:31	1
In	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
his	1
disciples	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
eat.	1
	1
4:32	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
meat	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
of.	1
	1
4:33	1
Therefore	1
said	1
the	1
disciples	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Hath	1
any	1
man	1
brought	1
him	1
ought	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
4:34	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
meat	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
finish	1
his	1
work.	1
	1
4:35	1
Say	1
not	1
ye,	1
There	1
are	1
yet	1
four	1
months,	1
and	1
then	1
cometh	1
harvest?	1
behold,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Lift	1
up	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
fields;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
white	1
already	1
to	1
harvest.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
receiveth	1
wages,	1
and	1
gathereth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal:	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
that	1
soweth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
reapeth	1
may	1
rejoice	1
together.	1
	1
4:37	1
And	1
herein	1
is	1
that	1
saying	1
true,	1
One	1
soweth,	1
and	1
another	1
reapeth.	1
	1
4:38	1
I	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
reap	1
that	1
whereon	1
ye	1
bestowed	1
no	1
labour:	1
other	1
men	1
laboured,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
entered	1
into	1
their	1
labours.	1
	1
4:39	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
which	1
testified,	1
He	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
ever	1
I	1
did.	1
	1
4:40	1
So	1
when	1
the	1
Samaritans	1
were	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
they	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
tarry	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
he	1
abode	1
there	1
two	1
days.	1
	1
4:41	1
And	1
many	1
more	1
believed	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
word;	1
4:42	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
woman,	1
Now	1
we	1
believe,	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
saying:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Saviour	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
4:43	1
Now	1
after	1
two	1
days	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
4:44	1
For	1
Jesus	1
himself	1
testified,	1
that	1
a	1
prophet	1
hath	1
no	1
honour	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
	1
4:45	1
Then	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
the	1
Galilaeans	1
received	1
him,	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
for	1
they	1
also	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
feast.	1
	1
4:46	1
So	1
Jesus	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
Cana	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
where	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
water	1
wine.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
nobleman,	1
whose	1
son	1
was	1
sick	1
at	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
4:47	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee,	1
he	1
went	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
besought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
heal	1
his	1
son:	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
4:48	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
Except	1
ye	1
see	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
4:49	1
The	1
nobleman	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
come	1
down	1
ere	1
my	1
child	1
die.	1
	1
4:50	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way;	1
thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
believed	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
	1
4:51	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
down,	1
his	1
servants	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
told	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth.	1
	1
4:52	1
Then	1
enquired	1
he	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
amend.	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
seventh	1
hour	1
the	1
fever	1
left	1
him.	1
	1
4:53	1
So	1
the	1
father	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
hour,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
son	1
liveth:	1
and	1
himself	1
believed,	1
and	1
his	1
whole	1
house.	1
	1
4:54	1
This	1
is	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
into	1
Galilee.	1
	1
5:1	1
After	1
this	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
and	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
5:2	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
by	1
the	1
sheep	1
market	1
a	1
pool,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
Bethesda,	1
having	1
five	1
porches.	1
	1
5:3	1
In	1
these	1
lay	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
of	1
impotent	1
folk,	1
of	1
blind,	1
halt,	1
withered,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
moving	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
	1
5:4	1
For	1
an	1
angel	1
went	1
down	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
season	1
into	1
the	1
pool,	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
water:	1
whosoever	1
then	1
first	1
after	1
the	1
troubling	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
stepped	1
in	1
was	1
made	1
whole	1
of	1
whatsoever	1
disease	1
he	1
had.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
there,	1
which	1
had	1
an	1
infirmity	1
thirty	1
and	1
eight	1
years.	1
	1
5:6	1
When	1
Jesus	1
saw	1
him	1
lie,	1
and	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
now	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
be	1
made	1
whole?	1
	1
5:7	1
The	1
impotent	1
man	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
man,	1
when	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
troubled,	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
pool:	1
but	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
coming,	1
another	1
steppeth	1
down	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
5:8	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:9	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
made	1
whole,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
walked:	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath.	1
	1
5:10	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
cured,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day:	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
carry	1
thy	1
bed.	1
	1
5:11	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
whole,	1
the	1
same	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
5:12	1
Then	1
asked	1
they	1
him,	1
What	1
man	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
thee,	1
Take	1
up	1
thy	1
bed,	1
and	1
walk?	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
healed	1
wist	1
not	1
who	1
it	1
was:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
had	1
conveyed	1
himself	1
away,	1
a	1
multitude	1
being	1
in	1
that	1
place.	1
	1
5:14	1
Afterward	1
Jesus	1
findeth	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
made	1
whole:	1
sin	1
no	1
more,	1
lest	1
a	1
worse	1
thing	1
come	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
5:15	1
The	1
man	1
departed,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
whole.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
therefore	1
did	1
the	1
Jews	1
persecute	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
slay	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
5:17	1
But	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
My	1
Father	1
worketh	1
hitherto,	1
and	1
I	1
work.	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
sabbath,	1
but	1
said	1
also	1
that	1
God	1
was	1
his	1
Father,	1
making	1
himself	1
equal	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
5:19	1
Then	1
answered	1
Jesus	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
Son	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
himself,	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
Father	1
do:	1
for	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
he	1
doeth,	1
these	1
also	1
doeth	1
the	1
Son	1
likewise.	1
	1
5:20	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
loveth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
sheweth	1
him	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
himself	1
doeth:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
marvel.	1
	1
5:21	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
raiseth	1
up	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
quickeneth	1
them;	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
Son	1
quickeneth	1
whom	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
5:22	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
judgeth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
hath	1
committed	1
all	1
judgment	1
unto	1
the	1
Son:	1
5:23	1
That	1
all	1
men	1
should	1
honour	1
the	1
Son,	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
honour	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
He	1
that	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Son	1
honoureth	1
not	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
5:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
heareth	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
condemnation;	1
but	1
is	1
passed	1
from	1
death	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
5:25	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
and	1
now	1
is,	1
when	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
hear	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
5:26	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
so	1
hath	1
he	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
Son	1
to	1
have	1
life	1
in	1
himself;	1
5:27	1
And	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
authority	1
to	1
execute	1
judgment	1
also,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man.	1
	1
5:28	1
Marvel	1
not	1
at	1
this:	1
for	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
coming,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
graves	1
shall	1
hear	1
his	1
voice,	1
5:29	1
And	1
shall	1
come	1
forth;	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
good,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
done	1
evil,	1
unto	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
damnation.	1
	1
5:30	1
I	1
can	1
of	1
mine	1
own	1
self	1
do	1
nothing:	1
as	1
I	1
hear,	1
I	1
judge:	1
and	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
just;	1
because	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:31	1
If	1
I	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
my	1
witness	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
5:32	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
that	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
witness	1
which	1
he	1
witnesseth	1
of	1
me	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
5:33	1
Ye	1
sent	1
unto	1
John,	1
and	1
he	1
bare	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
5:34	1
But	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
testimony	1
from	1
man:	1
but	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
5:35	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
burning	1
and	1
a	1
shining	1
light:	1
and	1
ye	1
were	1
willing	1
for	1
a	1
season	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
light.	1
	1
5:36	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
greater	1
witness	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
John:	1
for	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
to	1
finish,	1
the	1
same	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
5:37	1
And	1
the	1
Father	1
himself,	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
hath	1
borne	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
Ye	1
have	1
neither	1
heard	1
his	1
voice	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
nor	1
seen	1
his	1
shape.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
his	1
word	1
abiding	1
in	1
you:	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent,	1
him	1
ye	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
5:39	1
Search	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
for	1
in	1
them	1
ye	1
think	1
ye	1
have	1
eternal	1
life:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
they	1
which	1
testify	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
ye	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life.	1
	1
5:41	1
I	1
receive	1
not	1
honour	1
from	1
men.	1
	1
5:42	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
5:43	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
and	1
ye	1
receive	1
me	1
not:	1
if	1
another	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
him	1
ye	1
will	1
receive.	1
	1
5:44	1
How	1
can	1
ye	1
believe,	1
which	1
receive	1
honour	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
seek	1
not	1
the	1
honour	1
that	1
cometh	1
from	1
God	1
only?	1
	1
5:45	1
Do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
accuse	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
Father:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
accuseth	1
you,	1
even	1
Moses,	1
in	1
whom	1
ye	1
trust.	1
	1
5:46	1
For	1
had	1
ye	1
believed	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
would	1
have	1
believed	1
me;	1
for	1
he	1
wrote	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
5:47	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
his	1
writings,	1
how	1
shall	1
ye	1
believe	1
my	1
words?	1
	1
6:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias.	1
	1
6:2	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
followed	1
him,	1
because	1
they	1
saw	1
his	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
on	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
diseased.	1
	1
6:3	1
And	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
mountain,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
6:4	1
And	1
the	1
passover,	1
a	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
nigh.	1
	1
6:5	1
When	1
Jesus	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Whence	1
shall	1
we	1
buy	1
bread,	1
that	1
these	1
may	1
eat?	1
	1
6:6	1
And	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
prove	1
him:	1
for	1
he	1
himself	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do.	1
	1
6:7	1
Philip	1
answered	1
him,	1
Two	1
hundred	1
pennyworth	1
of	1
bread	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
take	1
a	1
little.	1
	1
6:8	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Andrew,	1
Simon	1
Peter's	1
brother,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
6:9	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lad	1
here,	1
which	1
hath	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
and	1
two	1
small	1
fishes:	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
among	1
so	1
many?	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Make	1
the	1
men	1
sit	1
down.	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
grass	1
in	1
the	1
place.	1
So	1
the	1
men	1
sat	1
down,	1
in	1
number	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
Jesus	1
took	1
the	1
loaves;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
distributed	1
to	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
set	1
down;	1
and	1
likewise	1
of	1
the	1
fishes	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
would.	1
	1
6:12	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
filled,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Gather	1
up	1
the	1
fragments	1
that	1
remain,	1
that	1
nothing	1
be	1
lost.	1
	1
6:13	1
Therefore	1
they	1
gathered	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
filled	1
twelve	1
baskets	1
with	1
the	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
barley	1
loaves,	1
which	1
remained	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
eaten.	1
	1
6:14	1
Then	1
those	1
men,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
miracle	1
that	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
that	1
prophet	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:15	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
king,	1
he	1
departed	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
mountain	1
himself	1
alone.	1
	1
6:16	1
And	1
when	1
even	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
6:17	1
And	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
toward	1
Capernaum.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
dark,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
6:18	1
And	1
the	1
sea	1
arose	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
wind	1
that	1
blew.	1
	1
6:19	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
rowed	1
about	1
five	1
and	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
furlongs,	1
they	1
see	1
Jesus	1
walking	1
on	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
drawing	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:20	1
But	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
I;	1
be	1
not	1
afraid.	1
	1
6:21	1
Then	1
they	1
willingly	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
ship:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
land	1
whither	1
they	1
went.	1
	1
6:22	1
The	1
day	1
following,	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
other	1
boat	1
there,	1
save	1
that	1
one	1
whereinto	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
entered,	1
and	1
that	1
Jesus	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
into	1
the	1
boat,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
gone	1
away	1
alone;	1
6:23	1
(Howbeit	1
there	1
came	1
other	1
boats	1
from	1
Tiberias	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
did	1
eat	1
bread,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
given	1
thanks:)	1
6:24	1
When	1
the	1
people	1
therefore	1
saw	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
neither	1
his	1
disciples,	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
shipping,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Capernaum,	1
seeking	1
for	1
Jesus.	1
	1
6:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabbi,	1
when	1
camest	1
thou	1
hither?	1
	1
6:26	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
not	1
because	1
ye	1
saw	1
the	1
miracles,	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
did	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
loaves,	1
and	1
were	1
filled.	1
	1
6:27	1
Labour	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
meat	1
which	1
perisheth,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
meat	1
which	1
endureth	1
unto	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
which	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
shall	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
for	1
him	1
hath	1
God	1
the	1
Father	1
sealed.	1
	1
6:28	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
6:29	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
sent.	1
	1
6:30	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
sign	1
shewest	1
thou	1
then,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
see,	1
and	1
believe	1
thee?	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
work?	1
	1
6:31	1
Our	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
desert;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
gave	1
them	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
6:32	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Moses	1
gave	1
you	1
not	1
that	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven;	1
but	1
my	1
Father	1
giveth	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
bread	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:33	1
For	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
giveth	1
life	1
unto	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:34	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
evermore	1
give	1
us	1
this	1
bread.	1
	1
6:35	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
of	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
hunger;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
thirst.	1
	1
6:36	1
But	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
also	1
have	1
seen	1
me,	1
and	1
believe	1
not.	1
	1
6:37	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
giveth	1
me	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
him	1
that	1
cometh	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
6:38	1
For	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
mine	1
own	1
will,	1
but	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
6:39	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Father's	1
will	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
nothing,	1
but	1
should	1
raise	1
it	1
up	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:40	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
which	1
seeth	1
the	1
Son,	1
and	1
believeth	1
on	1
him,	1
may	1
have	1
everlasting	1
life:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:41	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
murmured	1
at	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
6:42	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Joseph,	1
whose	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
we	1
know?	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven?	1
	1
6:43	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Murmur	1
not	1
among	1
yourselves.	1
	1
6:44	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
except	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
draw	1
him:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:45	1
It	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
prophets,	1
And	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
taught	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
Every	1
man	1
therefore	1
that	1
hath	1
heard,	1
and	1
hath	1
learned	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
cometh	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
6:46	1
Not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father,	1
save	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
6:47	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
hath	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:48	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
bread	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:49	1
Your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
and	1
are	1
dead.	1
	1
6:50	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
bread	1
which	1
cometh	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
eat	1
thereof,	1
and	1
not	1
die.	1
	1
6:51	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
living	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
eat	1
of	1
this	1
bread,	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
the	1
bread	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
is	1
my	1
flesh,	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
6:52	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
strove	1
among	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
How	1
can	1
this	1
man	1
give	1
us	1
his	1
flesh	1
to	1
eat?	1
	1
6:53	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
ye	1
eat	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
and	1
drink	1
his	1
blood,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
life	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
6:54	1
Whoso	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
hath	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
raise	1
him	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
6:55	1
For	1
my	1
flesh	1
is	1
meat	1
indeed,	1
and	1
my	1
blood	1
is	1
drink	1
indeed.	1
	1
6:56	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
drinketh	1
my	1
blood,	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
6:57	1
As	1
the	1
living	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
live	1
by	1
the	1
Father:	1
so	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
me,	1
even	1
he	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
6:58	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
bread	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven:	1
not	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did	1
eat	1
manna,	1
and	1
are	1
dead:	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
of	1
this	1
bread	1
shall	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
	1
6:59	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
Capernaum.	1
	1
6:60	1
Many	1
therefore	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
this,	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
hard	1
saying;	1
who	1
can	1
hear	1
it?	1
	1
6:61	1
When	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
in	1
himself	1
that	1
his	1
disciples	1
murmured	1
at	1
it,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Doth	1
this	1
offend	1
you?	1
	1
6:62	1
What	1
and	1
if	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
ascend	1
up	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
before?	1
	1
6:63	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
quickeneth;	1
the	1
flesh	1
profiteth	1
nothing:	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you,	1
they	1
are	1
spirit,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
life.	1
	1
6:64	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
believe	1
not.	1
For	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
that	1
believed	1
not,	1
and	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him.	1
	1
6:65	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Therefore	1
said	1
I	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
unto	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
6:66	1
From	1
that	1
time	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
went	1
back,	1
and	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
6:67	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
the	1
twelve,	1
Will	1
ye	1
also	1
go	1
away?	1
	1
6:68	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
answered	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
to	1
whom	1
shall	1
we	1
go?	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
eternal	1
life.	1
	1
6:69	1
And	1
we	1
believe	1
and	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
6:70	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Have	1
not	1
I	1
chosen	1
you	1
twelve,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
6:71	1
He	1
spake	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon:	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve.	1
	1
7:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
Galilee:	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
Jewry,	1
because	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
7:2	1
Now	1
the	1
Jew's	1
feast	1
of	1
tabernacles	1
was	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
7:3	1
His	1
brethren	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Depart	1
hence,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea,	1
that	1
thy	1
disciples	1
also	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
thou	1
doest.	1
	1
7:4	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
openly.	1
If	1
thou	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
shew	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
neither	1
did	1
his	1
brethren	1
believe	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:6	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
My	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
come:	1
but	1
your	1
time	1
is	1
alway	1
ready.	1
	1
7:7	1
The	1
world	1
cannot	1
hate	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
it	1
hateth,	1
because	1
I	1
testify	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
thereof	1
are	1
evil.	1
	1
7:8	1
Go	1
ye	1
up	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
up	1
yet	1
unto	1
this	1
feast:	1
for	1
my	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
full	1
come.	1
	1
7:9	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
abode	1
still	1
in	1
Galilee.	1
	1
7:10	1
But	1
when	1
his	1
brethren	1
were	1
gone	1
up,	1
then	1
went	1
he	1
also	1
up	1
unto	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
openly,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
secret.	1
	1
7:11	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
sought	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
feast,	1
and	1
said,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
7:12	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
murmuring	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
concerning	1
him:	1
for	1
some	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
man:	1
others	1
said,	1
Nay;	1
but	1
he	1
deceiveth	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
7:13	1
Howbeit	1
no	1
man	1
spake	1
openly	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
7:14	1
Now	1
about	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
Jesus	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
taught.	1
	1
7:15	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
marvelled,	1
saying,	1
How	1
knoweth	1
this	1
man	1
letters,	1
having	1
never	1
learned?	1
	1
7:16	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
My	1
doctrine	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
his	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
will	1
do	1
his	1
will,	1
he	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
doctrine,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
or	1
whether	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
myself.	1
	1
7:18	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
of	1
himself	1
seeketh	1
his	1
own	1
glory:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
seeketh	1
his	1
glory	1
that	1
sent	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
no	1
unrighteousness	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
7:19	1
Did	1
not	1
Moses	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
yet	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
keepeth	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
Why	1
go	1
ye	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me?	1
	1
7:20	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil:	1
who	1
goeth	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
thee?	1
	1
7:21	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
one	1
work,	1
and	1
ye	1
all	1
marvel.	1
	1
7:22	1
Moses	1
therefore	1
gave	1
unto	1
you	1
circumcision;	1
(not	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
Moses,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
fathers;)	1
and	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
circumcise	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
7:23	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
receive	1
circumcision,	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
broken;	1
are	1
ye	1
angry	1
at	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
man	1
every	1
whit	1
whole	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day?	1
	1
7:24	1
Judge	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
appearance,	1
but	1
judge	1
righteous	1
judgment.	1
	1
7:25	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Jerusalem,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he,	1
whom	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
kill?	1
	1
7:26	1
But,	1
lo,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
boldly,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
nothing	1
unto	1
him.	1
Do	1
the	1
rulers	1
know	1
indeed	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
Christ?	1
7:27	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
know	1
this	1
man	1
whence	1
he	1
is:	1
but	1
when	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
no	1
man	1
knoweth	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
7:28	1
Then	1
cried	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
as	1
he	1
taught,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
both	1
know	1
me,	1
and	1
ye	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
come	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true,	1
whom	1
ye	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
hath	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:30	1
Then	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
because	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
7:31	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Christ	1
cometh,	1
will	1
he	1
do	1
more	1
miracles	1
than	1
these	1
which	1
this	1
man	1
hath	1
done?	1
7:32	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
murmured	1
such	1
things	1
concerning	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
sent	1
officers	1
to	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
am	1
I	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
7:34	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
7:35	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Whither	1
will	1
he	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
him?	1
will	1
he	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
dispersed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
teach	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
7:36	1
What	1
manner	1
of	1
saying	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
me:	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
thither	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come?	1
	1
7:37	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
day,	1
that	1
great	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
feast,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
thirst,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
drink.	1
	1
7:38	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
scripture	1
hath	1
said,	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
belly	1
shall	1
flow	1
rivers	1
of	1
living	1
water.	1
	1
7:39	1
(But	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
which	1
they	1
that	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
should	1
receive:	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
given;	1
because	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
glorified.)	1
	1
7:40	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
saying,	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
Prophet.	1
	1
7:41	1
Others	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
Christ.	1
But	1
some	1
said,	1
Shall	1
Christ	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
7:42	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
scripture	1
said,	1
That	1
Christ	1
cometh	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Bethlehem,	1
where	1
David	1
was?	1
	1
7:43	1
So	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
because	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:44	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
7:45	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees;	1
and	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
brought	1
him?	1
	1
7:46	1
The	1
officers	1
answered,	1
Never	1
man	1
spake	1
like	1
this	1
man.	1
	1
7:47	1
Then	1
answered	1
them	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
Are	1
ye	1
also	1
deceived?	1
	1
7:48	1
Have	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
believed	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
7:49	1
But	1
this	1
people	1
who	1
knoweth	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
cursed.	1
	1
7:50	1
Nicodemus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
(he	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
them,)	1
7:51	1
Doth	1
our	1
law	1
judge	1
any	1
man,	1
before	1
it	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
doeth?	1
	1
7:52	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
also	1
of	1
Galilee?	1
	1
Search,	1
and	1
look:	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
Galilee	1
ariseth	1
no	1
prophet.	1
	1
7:53	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
went	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
house.	1
	1
8:1	1
Jesus	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
mount	1
of	1
Olives.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
came	1
unto	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
taught	1
them.	1
	1
8:3	1
And	1
the	1
scribes	1
and	1
Pharisees	1
brought	1
unto	1
him	1
a	1
woman	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
8:4	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
adultery,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act.	1
	1
8:5	1
Now	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
commanded	1
us,	1
that	1
such	1
should	1
be	1
stoned:	1
but	1
what	1
sayest	1
thou?	1
	1
8:6	1
This	1
they	1
said,	1
tempting	1
him,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him.	1
But	1
Jesus	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
8:7	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
continued	1
asking	1
him,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
without	1
sin	1
among	1
you,	1
let	1
him	1
first	1
cast	1
a	1
stone	1
at	1
her.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
wrote	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
8:9	1
And	1
they	1
which	1
heard	1
it,	1
being	1
convicted	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
conscience,	1
went	1
out	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
eldest,	1
even	1
unto	1
the	1
last:	1
and	1
Jesus	1
was	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
8:10	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lifted	1
up	1
himself,	1
and	1
saw	1
none	1
but	1
the	1
woman,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
where	1
are	1
those	1
thine	1
accusers?	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
condemned	1
thee?	1
	1
8:11	1
She	1
said,	1
No	1
man,	1
Lord.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Neither	1
do	1
I	1
condemn	1
thee:	1
go,	1
and	1
sin	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
8:12	1
Then	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
he	1
that	1
followeth	1
me	1
shall	1
not	1
walk	1
in	1
darkness,	1
but	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
8:13	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
bearest	1
record	1
of	1
thyself;	1
thy	1
record	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
	1
8:14	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Though	1
I	1
bear	1
record	1
of	1
myself,	1
yet	1
my	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
whence	1
I	1
came,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go;	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
tell	1
whence	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
whither	1
I	1
go.	1
	1
8:15	1
Ye	1
judge	1
after	1
the	1
flesh;	1
I	1
judge	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
8:16	1
And	1
yet	1
if	1
I	1
judge,	1
my	1
judgment	1
is	1
true:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
but	1
I	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:17	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
that	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
two	1
men	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
8:18	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
that	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
beareth	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
8:19	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
thy	1
Father?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Ye	1
neither	1
know	1
me,	1
nor	1
my	1
Father:	1
if	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
8:20	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
treasury,	1
as	1
he	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him;	1
for	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come.	1
	1
8:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
again	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me,	1
and	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:22	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Will	1
he	1
kill	1
himself?	1
because	1
he	1
saith,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
from	1
beneath;	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
above:	1
ye	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
world;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
8:24	1
I	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins:	1
for	1
if	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
8:25	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
And	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Even	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
8:26	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
true;	1
and	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:27	1
They	1
understood	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
8:28	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them,	1
When	1
ye	1
have	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man,	1
then	1
shall	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
taught	1
me,	1
I	1
speak	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
8:29	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
me	1
is	1
with	1
me:	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
not	1
left	1
me	1
alone;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
always	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
please	1
him.	1
	1
8:30	1
As	1
he	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
8:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
those	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
on	1
him,	1
If	1
ye	1
continue	1
in	1
my	1
word,	1
then	1
are	1
ye	1
my	1
disciples	1
indeed;	1
8:32	1
And	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
truth	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free.	1
	1
8:33	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
Abraham's	1
seed,	1
and	1
were	1
never	1
in	1
bondage	1
to	1
any	1
man:	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
Ye	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
free?	1
	1
8:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whosoever	1
committeth	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
servant	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:35	1
And	1
the	1
servant	1
abideth	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
ever:	1
but	1
the	1
Son	1
abideth	1
ever.	1
	1
8:36	1
If	1
the	1
Son	1
therefore	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
free,	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
free	1
indeed.	1
	1
8:37	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
Abraham's	1
seed;	1
but	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
because	1
my	1
word	1
hath	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:38	1
I	1
speak	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
my	1
Father:	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
your	1
father.	1
	1
8:39	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Abraham	1
is	1
our	1
father.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
Abraham's	1
children,	1
ye	1
would	1
do	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
now	1
ye	1
seek	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
hath	1
told	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
God:	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
Abraham.	1
	1
8:41	1
Ye	1
do	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
your	1
father.	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him,	1
We	1
be	1
not	1
born	1
of	1
fornication;	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
Father,	1
even	1
God.	1
	1
8:42	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
God	1
were	1
your	1
Father,	1
ye	1
would	1
love	1
me:	1
for	1
I	1
proceeded	1
forth	1
and	1
came	1
from	1
God;	1
neither	1
came	1
I	1
of	1
myself,	1
but	1
he	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
8:43	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
understand	1
my	1
speech?	1
even	1
because	1
ye	1
cannot	1
hear	1
my	1
word.	1
	1
8:44	1
Ye	1
are	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
ye	1
will	1
do.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
murderer	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
abode	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
truth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
him.	1
When	1
he	1
speaketh	1
a	1
lie,	1
he	1
speaketh	1
of	1
his	1
own:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liar,	1
and	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
8:45	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
ye	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
8:46	1
Which	1
of	1
you	1
convinceth	1
me	1
of	1
sin?	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
believe	1
me?	1
	1
8:47	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
God	1
heareth	1
God's	1
words:	1
ye	1
therefore	1
hear	1
them	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:48	1
Then	1
answered	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Say	1
we	1
not	1
well	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Samaritan,	1
and	1
hast	1
a	1
devil?	1
	1
8:49	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
devil;	1
but	1
I	1
honour	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
dishonour	1
me.	1
	1
8:50	1
And	1
I	1
seek	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
glory:	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
seeketh	1
and	1
judgeth.	1
	1
8:51	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
death.	1
	1
8:52	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil.	1
	1
Abraham	1
is	1
dead,	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
and	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
keep	1
my	1
saying,	1
he	1
shall	1
never	1
taste	1
of	1
death.	1
	1
8:53	1
Art	1
thou	1
greater	1
than	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
is	1
dead?	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
dead:	1
whom	1
makest	1
thou	1
thyself?	1
	1
8:54	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
If	1
I	1
honour	1
myself,	1
my	1
honour	1
is	1
nothing:	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
that	1
honoureth	1
me;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
say,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
God:	1
8:55	1
Yet	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him:	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
I	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
liar	1
like	1
unto	1
you:	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
saying.	1
	1
8:56	1
Your	1
father	1
Abraham	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
day:	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
glad.	1
	1
8:57	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
art	1
not	1
yet	1
fifty	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
Abraham?	1
	1
8:58	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Before	1
Abraham	1
was,	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
8:59	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
up	1
stones	1
to	1
cast	1
at	1
him:	1
but	1
Jesus	1
hid	1
himself,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
passed	1
by.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
as	1
Jesus	1
passed	1
by,	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
blind	1
from	1
his	1
birth.	1
	1
9:2	1
And	1
his	1
disciples	1
asked	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Master,	1
who	1
did	1
sin,	1
this	1
man,	1
or	1
his	1
parents,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
	1
9:3	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Neither	1
hath	1
this	1
man	1
sinned,	1
nor	1
his	1
parents:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
9:4	1
I	1
must	1
work	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me,	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
day:	1
the	1
night	1
cometh,	1
when	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
work.	1
	1
9:5	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
9:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
spat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
made	1
clay	1
of	1
the	1
spittle,	1
and	1
he	1
anointed	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
clay,	1
9:7	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go,	1
wash	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
(which	1
is	1
by	1
interpretation,	1
Sent.)	1
He	1
went	1
his	1
way	1
therefore,	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
came	1
seeing.	1
	1
9:8	1
The	1
neighbours	1
therefore,	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
before	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
blind,	1
said,	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
sat	1
and	1
begged?	1
	1
9:9	1
Some	1
said,	1
This	1
is	1
he:	1
others	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
9:10	1
Therefore	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
were	1
thine	1
eyes	1
opened?	1
	1
9:11	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Jesus	1
made	1
clay,	1
and	1
anointed	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
pool	1
of	1
Siloam,	1
and	1
wash:	1
and	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
I	1
received	1
sight.	1
	1
9:12	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
unto	1
him,	1
Where	1
is	1
he?	1
He	1
said,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
	1
9:13	1
They	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
him	1
that	1
aforetime	1
was	1
blind.	1
	1
9:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day	1
when	1
Jesus	1
made	1
the	1
clay,	1
and	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:15	1
Then	1
again	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
He	1
put	1
clay	1
upon	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
and	1
I	1
washed,	1
and	1
do	1
see.	1
	1
9:16	1
Therefore	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
because	1
he	1
keepeth	1
not	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
Others	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
sinner	1
do	1
such	1
miracles?	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
9:17	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
blind	1
man	1
again,	1
What	1
sayest	1
thou	1
of	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
He	1
said,	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
prophet.	1
	1
9:18	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
concerning	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
blind,	1
and	1
received	1
his	1
sight,	1
until	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
they	1
asked	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
son,	1
who	1
ye	1
say	1
was	1
born	1
blind?	1
how	1
then	1
doth	1
he	1
now	1
see?	1
	1
9:20	1
His	1
parents	1
answered	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
our	1
son,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
blind:	1
9:21	1
But	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
now	1
seeth,	1
we	1
know	1
not;	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes,	1
we	1
know	1
not:	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him:	1
he	1
shall	1
speak	1
for	1
himself.	1
	1
9:22	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
his	1
parents,	1
because	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
Jews	1
had	1
agreed	1
already,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
did	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
Christ,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
9:23	1
Therefore	1
said	1
his	1
parents,	1
He	1
is	1
of	1
age;	1
ask	1
him.	1
	1
9:24	1
Then	1
again	1
called	1
they	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
blind,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Give	1
God	1
the	1
praise:	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
sinner.	1
	1
9:25	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Whether	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sinner	1
or	1
no,	1
I	1
know	1
not:	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
know,	1
that,	1
whereas	1
I	1
was	1
blind,	1
now	1
I	1
see.	1
	1
9:26	1
Then	1
said	1
they	1
to	1
him	1
again,	1
What	1
did	1
he	1
to	1
thee?	1
how	1
opened	1
he	1
thine	1
eyes?	1
	1
9:27	1
He	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,	1
and	1
ye	1
did	1
not	1
hear:	1
wherefore	1
would	1
ye	1
hear	1
it	1
again?	1
will	1
ye	1
also	1
be	1
his	1
disciples?	1
	1
9:28	1
Then	1
they	1
reviled	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou	1
art	1
his	1
disciple;	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
Moses'	1
disciples.	1
	1
9:29	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
spake	1
unto	1
Moses:	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
fellow,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is.	1
	1
9:30	1
The	1
man	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Why	1
herein	1
is	1
a	1
marvellous	1
thing,	1
that	1
ye	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
whence	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
hath	1
opened	1
mine	1
eyes.	1
	1
9:31	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
God	1
heareth	1
not	1
sinners:	1
but	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
doeth	1
his	1
will,	1
him	1
he	1
heareth.	1
	1
9:32	1
Since	1
the	1
world	1
began	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
heard	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
born	1
blind.	1
	1
9:33	1
If	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
God,	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
9:34	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
wast	1
altogether	1
born	1
in	1
sins,	1
and	1
dost	1
thou	1
teach	1
us?	1
And	1
they	1
cast	1
him	1
out.	1
	1
9:35	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
cast	1
him	1
out;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Dost	1
thou	1
believe	1
on	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
9:36	1
He	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Who	1
is	1
he,	1
Lord,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
believe	1
on	1
him?	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
hast	1
both	1
seen	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
talketh	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
believe.	1
And	1
he	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
9:39	1
And	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
For	1
judgment	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
not	1
might	1
see;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
see	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
blind.	1
	1
9:40	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
him	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Are	1
we	1
blind	1
also?	1
	1
9:41	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
blind,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
ye	1
say,	1
We	1
see;	1
therefore	1
your	1
sin	1
remaineth.	1
	1
10:1	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
entereth	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
the	1
sheepfold,	1
but	1
climbeth	1
up	1
some	1
other	1
way,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
10:2	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
entereth	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
the	1
shepherd	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:3	1
To	1
him	1
the	1
porter	1
openeth;	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
hear	1
his	1
voice:	1
and	1
he	1
calleth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
leadeth	1
them	1
out.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
putteth	1
forth	1
his	1
own	1
sheep,	1
he	1
goeth	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
sheep	1
follow	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
his	1
voice.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
a	1
stranger	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
follow,	1
but	1
will	1
flee	1
from	1
him:	1
for	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
strangers.	1
	1
10:6	1
This	1
parable	1
spake	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not	1
what	1
things	1
they	1
were	1
which	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
10:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
again,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:8	1
All	1
that	1
ever	1
came	1
before	1
me	1
are	1
thieves	1
and	1
robbers:	1
but	1
the	1
sheep	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them.	1
	1
10:9	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
door:	1
by	1
me	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
enter	1
in,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
out,	1
and	1
find	1
pasture.	1
	1
10:10	1
The	1
thief	1
cometh	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
to	1
steal,	1
and	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
to	1
destroy:	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
abundantly.	1
	1
10:11	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd:	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd	1
giveth	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:12	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
whose	1
own	1
the	1
sheep	1
are	1
not,	1
seeth	1
the	1
wolf	1
coming,	1
and	1
leaveth	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
fleeth:	1
and	1
the	1
wolf	1
catcheth	1
them,	1
and	1
scattereth	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:13	1
The	1
hireling	1
fleeth,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
hireling,	1
and	1
careth	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:14	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
good	1
shepherd,	1
and	1
know	1
my	1
sheep,	1
and	1
am	1
known	1
of	1
mine.	1
	1
10:15	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
knoweth	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
know	1
I	1
the	1
Father:	1
and	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
sheep.	1
	1
10:16	1
And	1
other	1
sheep	1
I	1
have,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
fold:	1
them	1
also	1
I	1
must	1
bring,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
voice;	1
and	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
fold,	1
and	1
one	1
shepherd.	1
	1
10:17	1
Therefore	1
doth	1
my	1
Father	1
love	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
10:18	1
No	1
man	1
taketh	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
of	1
myself.	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
again.	1
This	1
commandment	1
have	1
I	1
received	1
of	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
10:19	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
division	1
therefore	1
again	1
among	1
the	1
Jews	1
for	1
these	1
sayings.	1
	1
10:20	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
He	1
hath	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
is	1
mad;	1
why	1
hear	1
ye	1
him?	1
	1
10:21	1
Others	1
said,	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
a	1
devil.	1
Can	1
a	1
devil	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
dedication,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
winter.	1
	1
10:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
10:24	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
Jews	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
How	1
long	1
dost	1
thou	1
make	1
us	1
to	1
doubt?	1
If	1
thou	1
be	1
the	1
Christ,	1
tell	1
us	1
plainly.	1
	1
10:25	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
and	1
ye	1
believed	1
not:	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
in	1
my	1
Father's	1
name,	1
they	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
ye	1
believe	1
not,	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
my	1
sheep,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
10:27	1
My	1
sheep	1
hear	1
my	1
voice,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
follow	1
me:	1
10:28	1
And	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
them	1
eternal	1
life;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
perish,	1
neither	1
shall	1
any	1
man	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
	1
10:29	1
My	1
Father,	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
me,	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
all;	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
pluck	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Father's	1
hand.	1
	1
10:30	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
are	1
one.	1
	1
10:31	1
Then	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
up	1
stones	1
again	1
to	1
stone	1
him.	1
	1
10:32	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Many	1
good	1
works	1
have	1
I	1
shewed	1
you	1
from	1
my	1
Father;	1
for	1
which	1
of	1
those	1
works	1
do	1
ye	1
stone	1
me?	1
	1
10:33	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
saying,	1
For	1
a	1
good	1
work	1
we	1
stone	1
thee	1
not;	1
but	1
for	1
blasphemy;	1
and	1
because	1
that	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
man,	1
makest	1
thyself	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
your	1
law,	1
I	1
said,	1
Ye	1
are	1
gods?	1
	1
10:35	1
If	1
he	1
called	1
them	1
gods,	1
unto	1
whom	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
scripture	1
cannot	1
be	1
broken;	1
10:36	1
Say	1
ye	1
of	1
him,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
sanctified,	1
and	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
Thou	1
blasphemest;	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
10:37	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
believe	1
me	1
not.	1
	1
10:38	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
do,	1
though	1
ye	1
believe	1
not	1
me,	1
believe	1
the	1
works:	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know,	1
and	1
believe,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
sought	1
again	1
to	1
take	1
him:	1
but	1
he	1
escaped	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hand,	1
10:40	1
And	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
beyond	1
Jordan	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
John	1
at	1
first	1
baptized;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
abode.	1
	1
10:41	1
And	1
many	1
resorted	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
John	1
did	1
no	1
miracle:	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
John	1
spake	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
were	1
true.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him	1
there.	1
	1
11:1	1
Now	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
was	1
sick,	1
named	1
Lazarus,	1
of	1
Bethany,	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Mary	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
Martha.	1
	1
11:2	1
(It	1
was	1
that	1
Mary	1
which	1
anointed	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
ointment,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair,	1
whose	1
brother	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
sick.)	1
	1
11:3	1
Therefore	1
his	1
sisters	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
behold,	1
he	1
whom	1
thou	1
lovest	1
is	1
sick.	1
	1
11:4	1
When	1
Jesus	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
said,	1
This	1
sickness	1
is	1
not	1
unto	1
death,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
might	1
be	1
glorified	1
thereby.	1
	1
11:5	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
Martha,	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
Lazarus.	1
	1
11:6	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
therefore	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
he	1
abode	1
two	1
days	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
	1
11:7	1
Then	1
after	1
that	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
into	1
Judaea	1
again.	1
	1
11:8	1
His	1
disciples	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
Master,	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
late	1
sought	1
to	1
stone	1
thee;	1
and	1
goest	1
thou	1
thither	1
again?	1
	1
11:9	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
twelve	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
day?	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
he	1
stumbleth	1
not,	1
because	1
he	1
seeth	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
world.	1
	1
11:10	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
night,	1
he	1
stumbleth,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
11:11	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
he:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Our	1
friend	1
Lazarus	1
sleepeth;	1
but	1
I	1
go,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
awake	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:12	1
Then	1
said	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
he	1
sleep,	1
he	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
	1
11:13	1
Howbeit	1
Jesus	1
spake	1
of	1
his	1
death:	1
but	1
they	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
taking	1
of	1
rest	1
in	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:14	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
them	1
plainly,	1
Lazarus	1
is	1
dead.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
for	1
your	1
sakes	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
ye	1
may	1
believe;	1
nevertheless	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
said	1
Thomas,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
unto	1
his	1
fellowdisciples,	1
Let	1
us	1
also	1
go,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
die	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
11:17	1
Then	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
four	1
days	1
already.	1
	1
11:18	1
Now	1
Bethany	1
was	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
furlongs	1
off:	1
11:19	1
And	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
came	1
to	1
Martha	1
and	1
Mary,	1
to	1
comfort	1
them	1
concerning	1
their	1
brother.	1
	1
11:20	1
Then	1
Martha,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming,	1
went	1
and	1
met	1
him:	1
but	1
Mary	1
sat	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
	1
11:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Martha	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:22	1
But	1
I	1
know,	1
that	1
even	1
now,	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
ask	1
of	1
God,	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
thee.	1
	1
11:23	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thy	1
brother	1
shall	1
rise	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
Martha	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
rise	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
resurrection	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
11:25	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
resurrection,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
he	1
that	1
believeth	1
in	1
me,	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
dead,	1
yet	1
shall	1
he	1
live:	1
11:26	1
And	1
whosoever	1
liveth	1
and	1
believeth	1
in	1
me	1
shall	1
never	1
die.	1
Believest	1
thou	1
this?	1
	1
11:27	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord:	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
she	1
went	1
her	1
way,	1
and	1
called	1
Mary	1
her	1
sister	1
secretly,	1
saying,	1
The	1
Master	1
is	1
come,	1
and	1
calleth	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
11:29	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
heard	1
that,	1
she	1
arose	1
quickly,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
11:30	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
place	1
where	1
Martha	1
met	1
him.	1
	1
11:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
then	1
which	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
comforted	1
her,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Mary,	1
that	1
she	1
rose	1
up	1
hastily	1
and	1
went	1
out,	1
followed	1
her,	1
saying,	1
She	1
goeth	1
unto	1
the	1
grave	1
to	1
weep	1
there.	1
	1
11:32	1
Then	1
when	1
Mary	1
was	1
come	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
she	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
been	1
here,	1
my	1
brother	1
had	1
not	1
died.	1
	1
11:33	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
her	1
weeping,	1
and	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
weeping	1
which	1
came	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
groaned	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
was	1
troubled.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
said,	1
Where	1
have	1
ye	1
laid	1
him?	1
They	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
come	1
and	1
see.	1
	1
11:35	1
Jesus	1
wept.	1
	1
11:36	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
how	1
he	1
loved	1
him!	1
	1
11:37	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
Could	1
not	1
this	1
man,	1
which	1
opened	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
have	1
caused	1
that	1
even	1
this	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
died?	1
	1
11:38	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
again	1
groaning	1
in	1
himself	1
cometh	1
to	1
the	1
grave.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
cave,	1
and	1
a	1
stone	1
lay	1
upon	1
it.	1
	1
11:39	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Take	1
ye	1
away	1
the	1
stone.	1
Martha,	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
dead,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
stinketh:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
been	1
dead	1
four	1
days.	1
	1
11:40	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Said	1
I	1
not	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
believe,	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
see	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
11:41	1
Then	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
the	1
stone	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
dead	1
was	1
laid.	1
And	1
Jesus	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
me.	1
	1
11:42	1
And	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
thou	1
hearest	1
me	1
always:	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
which	1
stand	1
by	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
11:43	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
thus	1
had	1
spoken,	1
he	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lazarus,	1
come	1
forth.	1
	1
11:44	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
was	1
dead	1
came	1
forth,	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
with	1
graveclothes:	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
was	1
bound	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
napkin.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Loose	1
him,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
11:45	1
Then	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
Mary,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
believed	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
11:46	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
their	1
ways	1
to	1
the	1
Pharisees,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
things	1
Jesus	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
11:47	1
Then	1
gathered	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
a	1
council,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
do	1
we?	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
doeth	1
many	1
miracles.	1
	1
11:48	1
If	1
we	1
let	1
him	1
thus	1
alone,	1
all	1
men	1
will	1
believe	1
on	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
Romans	1
shall	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
both	1
our	1
place	1
and	1
nation.	1
	1
11:49	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
named	1
Caiaphas,	1
being	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
all,	1
11:50	1
Nor	1
consider	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
us,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
perish	1
not.	1
	1
11:51	1
And	1
this	1
spake	1
he	1
not	1
of	1
himself:	1
but	1
being	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
year,	1
he	1
prophesied	1
that	1
Jesus	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
that	1
nation;	1
11:52	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
that	1
nation	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
also	1
he	1
should	1
gather	1
together	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad.	1
	1
11:53	1
Then	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
they	1
took	1
counsel	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
death.	1
	1
11:54	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
walked	1
no	1
more	1
openly	1
among	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
went	1
thence	1
unto	1
a	1
country	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
into	1
a	1
city	1
called	1
Ephraim,	1
and	1
there	1
continued	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
11:55	1
And	1
the	1
Jews'	1
passover	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand:	1
and	1
many	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
before	1
the	1
passover,	1
to	1
purify	1
themselves.	1
	1
11:56	1
Then	1
sought	1
they	1
for	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
spake	1
among	1
themselves,	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
What	1
think	1
ye,	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast?	1
	1
11:57	1
Now	1
both	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
commandment,	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
knew	1
where	1
he	1
were,	1
he	1
should	1
shew	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
take	1
him.	1
	1
12:1	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
six	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
passover	1
came	1
to	1
Bethany,	1
where	1
Lazarus	1
was,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
dead,	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:2	1
There	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
supper;	1
and	1
Martha	1
served:	1
but	1
Lazarus	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
12:3	1
Then	1
took	1
Mary	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
ointment	1
of	1
spikenard,	1
very	1
costly,	1
and	1
anointed	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
feet	1
with	1
her	1
hair:	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
ointment.	1
	1
12:4	1
Then	1
saith	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
which	1
should	1
betray	1
him,	1
12:5	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
this	1
ointment	1
sold	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
pence,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
poor?	1
	1
12:6	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
poor;	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
thief,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
and	1
bare	1
what	1
was	1
put	1
therein.	1
	1
12:7	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus,	1
Let	1
her	1
alone:	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
burying	1
hath	1
she	1
kept	1
this.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
the	1
poor	1
always	1
ye	1
have	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
me	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
always.	1
	1
12:9	1
Much	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
there:	1
and	1
they	1
came	1
not	1
for	1
Jesus'	1
sake	1
only,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
see	1
Lazarus	1
also,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
12:10	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
consulted	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
Lazarus	1
also	1
to	1
death;	1
12:11	1
Because	1
that	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
believed	1
on	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:12	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
much	1
people	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
feast,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
12:13	1
Took	1
branches	1
of	1
palm	1
trees,	1
and	1
went	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
cried,	1
Hosanna:	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
Israel	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
Jesus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
a	1
young	1
ass,	1
sat	1
thereon;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
12:15	1
Fear	1
not,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sion:	1
behold,	1
thy	1
King	1
cometh,	1
sitting	1
on	1
an	1
ass's	1
colt.	1
	1
12:16	1
These	1
things	1
understood	1
not	1
his	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
first:	1
but	1
when	1
Jesus	1
was	1
glorified,	1
then	1
remembered	1
they	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
12:17	1
The	1
people	1
therefore	1
that	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
called	1
Lazarus	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
grave,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
bare	1
record.	1
	1
12:18	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
the	1
people	1
also	1
met	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
this	1
miracle.	1
	1
12:19	1
The	1
Pharisees	1
therefore	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Perceive	1
ye	1
how	1
ye	1
prevail	1
nothing?	1
behold,	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
gone	1
after	1
him.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
certain	1
Greeks	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
at	1
the	1
feast:	1
12:21	1
The	1
same	1
came	1
therefore	1
to	1
Philip,	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
Bethsaida	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
desired	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Sir,	1
we	1
would	1
see	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:22	1
Philip	1
cometh	1
and	1
telleth	1
Andrew:	1
and	1
again	1
Andrew	1
and	1
Philip	1
tell	1
Jesus.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
saying,	1
The	1
hour	1
is	1
come,	1
that	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
glorified.	1
	1
12:24	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Except	1
a	1
corn	1
of	1
wheat	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
die,	1
it	1
abideth	1
alone:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
die,	1
it	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit.	1
	1
12:25	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
his	1
life	1
shall	1
lose	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
hateth	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
shall	1
keep	1
it	1
unto	1
life	1
eternal.	1
	1
12:26	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
let	1
him	1
follow	1
me;	1
and	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
shall	1
also	1
my	1
servant	1
be:	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
serve	1
me,	1
him	1
will	1
my	1
Father	1
honour.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
is	1
my	1
soul	1
troubled;	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say?	1
Father,	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
hour:	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
this	1
hour.	1
	1
12:28	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thy	1
name.	1
Then	1
came	1
there	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
heaven,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
both	1
glorified	1
it,	1
and	1
will	1
glorify	1
it	1
again.	1
	1
12:29	1
The	1
people	1
therefore,	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
heard	1
it,	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
thundered:	1
others	1
said,	1
An	1
angel	1
spake	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
12:30	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
This	1
voice	1
came	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
me,	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes.	1
	1
12:31	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
now	1
shall	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
be	1
cast	1
out.	1
	1
12:32	1
And	1
I,	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
lifted	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
will	1
draw	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
12:33	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
12:34	1
The	1
people	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
Christ	1
abideth	1
for	1
ever:	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou,	1
The	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
lifted	1
up?	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
Son	1
of	1
man?	1
	1
12:35	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
is	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
Walk	1
while	1
ye	1
have	1
the	1
light,	1
lest	1
darkness	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
walketh	1
in	1
darkness	1
knoweth	1
not	1
whither	1
he	1
goeth.	1
	1
12:36	1
While	1
ye	1
have	1
light,	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
light,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
light.	1
These	1
things	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
departed,	1
and	1
did	1
hide	1
himself	1
from	1
them.	1
	1
12:37	1
But	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
many	1
miracles	1
before	1
them,	1
yet	1
they	1
believed	1
not	1
on	1
him:	1
12:38	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
hath	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
been	1
revealed?	1
	1
12:39	1
Therefore	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
believe,	1
because	1
that	1
Esaias	1
said	1
again,	1
12:40	1
He	1
hath	1
blinded	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hardened	1
their	1
heart;	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
nor	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
12:41	1
These	1
things	1
said	1
Esaias,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
glory,	1
and	1
spake	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
12:42	1
Nevertheless	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
rulers	1
also	1
many	1
believed	1
on	1
him;	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
confess	1
him,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
12:43	1
For	1
they	1
loved	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
men	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:44	1
Jesus	1
cried	1
and	1
said,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
believeth	1
not	1
on	1
me,	1
but	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:45	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
seeth	1
me	1
seeth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
12:46	1
I	1
am	1
come	1
a	1
light	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
me	1
should	1
not	1
abide	1
in	1
darkness.	1
	1
12:47	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hear	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
believe	1
not,	1
I	1
judge	1
him	1
not:	1
for	1
I	1
came	1
not	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
12:48	1
He	1
that	1
rejecteth	1
me,	1
and	1
receiveth	1
not	1
my	1
words,	1
hath	1
one	1
that	1
judgeth	1
him:	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
the	1
same	1
shall	1
judge	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
day.	1
	1
12:49	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
spoken	1
of	1
myself;	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
which	1
sent	1
me,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
commandment,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
speak.	1
	1
12:50	1
And	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
commandment	1
is	1
life	1
everlasting:	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
speak	1
therefore,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
so	1
I	1
speak.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
before	1
the	1
feast	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
when	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
hour	1
was	1
come	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
having	1
loved	1
his	1
own	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
loved	1
them	1
unto	1
the	1
end.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
supper	1
being	1
ended,	1
the	1
devil	1
having	1
now	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
Simon's	1
son,	1
to	1
betray	1
him;	1
13:3	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
had	1
given	1
all	1
things	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
from	1
God,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
God;	1
13:4	1
He	1
riseth	1
from	1
supper,	1
and	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
garments;	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
towel,	1
and	1
girded	1
himself.	1
	1
13:5	1
After	1
that	1
he	1
poureth	1
water	1
into	1
a	1
bason,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
wash	1
the	1
disciples'	1
feet,	1
and	1
to	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
towel	1
wherewith	1
he	1
was	1
girded.	1
	1
13:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
he	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter:	1
and	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
dost	1
thou	1
wash	1
my	1
feet?	1
	1
13:7	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
I	1
do	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
know	1
hereafter.	1
	1
13:8	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
wash	1
my	1
feet.	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
wash	1
thee	1
not,	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
part	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
13:9	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
not	1
my	1
feet	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
my	1
head.	1
	1
13:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
him,	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
washed	1
needeth	1
not	1
save	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
feet,	1
but	1
is	1
clean	1
every	1
whit:	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
clean,	1
but	1
not	1
all.	1
	1
13:11	1
For	1
he	1
knew	1
who	1
should	1
betray	1
him;	1
therefore	1
said	1
he,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
clean.	1
	1
13:12	1
So	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
washed	1
their	1
feet,	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
was	1
set	1
down	1
again,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Know	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you?	1
	1
13:13	1
Ye	1
call	1
me	1
Master	1
and	1
Lord:	1
and	1
ye	1
say	1
well;	1
for	1
so	1
I	1
am.	1
	1
13:14	1
If	1
I	1
then,	1
your	1
Lord	1
and	1
Master,	1
have	1
washed	1
your	1
feet;	1
ye	1
also	1
ought	1
to	1
wash	1
one	1
another's	1
feet.	1
	1
13:15	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
an	1
example,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:16	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord;	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
sent	1
greater	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
sent	1
him.	1
	1
13:17	1
If	1
ye	1
know	1
these	1
things,	1
happy	1
are	1
ye	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
13:18	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
you	1
all:	1
I	1
know	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
chosen:	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
may	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
He	1
that	1
eateth	1
bread	1
with	1
me	1
hath	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
heel	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
13:19	1
Now	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
13:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
receiveth	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
send	1
receiveth	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
receiveth	1
me	1
receiveth	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
13:21	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified,	1
and	1
said,	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
betray	1
me.	1
	1
13:22	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
looked	1
one	1
on	1
another,	1
doubting	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:23	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
leaning	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
bosom	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved.	1
	1
13:24	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
beckoned	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
who	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
13:25	1
He	1
then	1
lying	1
on	1
Jesus'	1
breast	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
is	1
it?	1
13:26	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
He	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
a	1
sop,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
dipped	1
it.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
dipped	1
the	1
sop,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Judas	1
Iscariot,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Simon.	1
	1
13:27	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
sop	1
Satan	1
entered	1
into	1
him.	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
him,	1
That	1
thou	1
doest,	1
do	1
quickly.	1
	1
13:28	1
Now	1
no	1
man	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
knew	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
he	1
spake	1
this	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
13:29	1
For	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
thought,	1
because	1
Judas	1
had	1
the	1
bag,	1
that	1
Jesus	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Buy	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
against	1
the	1
feast;	1
or,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
something	1
to	1
the	1
poor.	1
	1
13:30	1
He	1
then	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
sop	1
went	1
immediately	1
out:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
night.	1
	1
13:31	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
out,	1
Jesus	1
said,	1
Now	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
glorified,	1
and	1
God	1
is	1
glorified	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
13:32	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
also	1
glorify	1
him	1
in	1
himself,	1
and	1
shall	1
straightway	1
glorify	1
him.	1
	1
13:33	1
Little	1
children,	1
yet	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
you.	1
Ye	1
shall	1
seek	1
me:	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
come;	1
so	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
13:34	1
A	1
new	1
commandment	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another;	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
13:35	1
By	1
this	1
shall	1
all	1
men	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
my	1
disciples,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
love	1
one	1
to	1
another.	1
	1
13:36	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Whither	1
I	1
go,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
follow	1
me	1
now;	1
but	1
thou	1
shalt	1
follow	1
me	1
afterwards.	1
	1
13:37	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
why	1
cannot	1
I	1
follow	1
thee	1
now?	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
down	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
thy	1
sake.	1
	1
13:38	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
for	1
my	1
sake?	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
The	1
cock	1
shall	1
not	1
crow,	1
till	1
thou	1
hast	1
denied	1
me	1
thrice.	1
	1
14:1	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled:	1
ye	1
believe	1
in	1
God,	1
believe	1
also	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:2	1
In	1
my	1
Father's	1
house	1
are	1
many	1
mansions:	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
you.	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you.	1
	1
14:3	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
prepare	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
again,	1
and	1
receive	1
you	1
unto	1
myself;	1
that	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
there	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
also.	1
	1
14:4	1
And	1
whither	1
I	1
go	1
ye	1
know,	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
ye	1
know.	1
	1
14:5	1
Thomas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
whither	1
thou	1
goest;	1
and	1
how	1
can	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
way?	1
	1
14:6	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
way,	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
life:	1
no	1
man	1
cometh	1
unto	1
the	1
Father,	1
but	1
by	1
me.	1
	1
14:7	1
If	1
ye	1
had	1
known	1
me,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
my	1
Father	1
also:	1
and	1
from	1
henceforth	1
ye	1
know	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
seen	1
him.	1
	1
14:8	1
Philip	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
it	1
sufficeth	1
us.	1
	1
14:9	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Have	1
I	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
yet	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
known	1
me,	1
Philip?	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
seen	1
me	1
hath	1
seen	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
how	1
sayest	1
thou	1
then,	1
Shew	1
us	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
14:10	1
Believest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me?	1
	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
speak	1
not	1
of	1
myself:	1
but	1
the	1
Father	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
doeth	1
the	1
works.	1
	1
14:11	1
Believe	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
me:	1
or	1
else	1
believe	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
works'	1
sake.	1
	1
14:12	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
He	1
that	1
believeth	1
on	1
me,	1
the	1
works	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
shall	1
he	1
do	1
also;	1
and	1
greater	1
works	1
than	1
these	1
shall	1
he	1
do;	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
14:13	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
may	1
be	1
glorified	1
in	1
the	1
Son.	1
	1
14:14	1
If	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it.	1
	1
14:15	1
If	1
ye	1
love	1
me,	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments.	1
	1
14:16	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
he	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
another	1
Comforter,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
abide	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
ever;	1
14:17	1
Even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth;	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
cannot	1
receive,	1
because	1
it	1
seeth	1
him	1
not,	1
neither	1
knoweth	1
him:	1
but	1
ye	1
know	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
dwelleth	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
you	1
comfortless:	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
seeth	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
ye	1
see	1
me:	1
because	1
I	1
live,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live	1
also.	1
	1
14:20	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
14:21	1
He	1
that	1
hath	1
my	1
commandments,	1
and	1
keepeth	1
them,	1
he	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
loveth	1
me:	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
shall	1
be	1
loved	1
of	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
manifest	1
myself	1
to	1
him.	1
	1
14:22	1
Judas	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
not	1
Iscariot,	1
Lord,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
manifest	1
thyself	1
unto	1
us,	1
and	1
not	1
unto	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
14:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
love	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
my	1
words:	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
will	1
love	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
our	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
14:24	1
He	1
that	1
loveth	1
me	1
not	1
keepeth	1
not	1
my	1
sayings:	1
and	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
ye	1
hear	1
is	1
not	1
mine,	1
but	1
the	1
Father's	1
which	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
14:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
being	1
yet	1
present	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
14:26	1
But	1
the	1
Comforter,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
the	1
Father	1
will	1
send	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
shall	1
teach	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
bring	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
your	1
remembrance,	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
14:27	1
Peace	1
I	1
leave	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
peace	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you:	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
world	1
giveth,	1
give	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
troubled,	1
neither	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
afraid.	1
	1
14:28	1
Ye	1
have	1
heard	1
how	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
go	1
away,	1
and	1
come	1
again	1
unto	1
you.	1
If	1
ye	1
loved	1
me,	1
ye	1
would	1
rejoice,	1
because	1
I	1
said,	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Father:	1
for	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
I.	1
	1
14:29	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
before	1
it	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
14:30	1
Hereafter	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
talk	1
much	1
with	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
cometh,	1
and	1
hath	1
nothing	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
14:31	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
Father;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
Father	1
gave	1
me	1
commandment,	1
even	1
so	1
I	1
do.	1
Arise,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
hence.	1
	1
15:1	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
true	1
vine,	1
and	1
my	1
Father	1
is	1
the	1
husbandman.	1
	1
15:2	1
Every	1
branch	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
beareth	1
not	1
fruit	1
he	1
taketh	1
away:	1
and	1
every	1
branch	1
that	1
beareth	1
fruit,	1
he	1
purgeth	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
bring	1
forth	1
more	1
fruit.	1
	1
15:3	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
clean	1
through	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:4	1
Abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
you.	1
As	1
the	1
branch	1
cannot	1
bear	1
fruit	1
of	1
itself,	1
except	1
it	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
vine;	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
15:5	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
vine,	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
branches:	1
He	1
that	1
abideth	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
him,	1
the	1
same	1
bringeth	1
forth	1
much	1
fruit:	1
for	1
without	1
me	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
nothing.	1
	1
15:6	1
If	1
a	1
man	1
abide	1
not	1
in	1
me,	1
he	1
is	1
cast	1
forth	1
as	1
a	1
branch,	1
and	1
is	1
withered;	1
and	1
men	1
gather	1
them,	1
and	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
burned.	1
	1
15:7	1
If	1
ye	1
abide	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
my	1
words	1
abide	1
in	1
you,	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
what	1
ye	1
will,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:8	1
Herein	1
is	1
my	1
Father	1
glorified,	1
that	1
ye	1
bear	1
much	1
fruit;	1
so	1
shall	1
ye	1
be	1
my	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:9	1
As	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
loved	1
me,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
loved	1
you:	1
continue	1
ye	1
in	1
my	1
love.	1
	1
15:10	1
If	1
ye	1
keep	1
my	1
commandments,	1
ye	1
shall	1
abide	1
in	1
my	1
love;	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
Father's	1
commandments,	1
and	1
abide	1
in	1
his	1
love.	1
	1
15:11	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
my	1
joy	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
might	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
15:12	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
commandment,	1
That	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
loved	1
you.	1
	1
15:13	1
Greater	1
love	1
hath	1
no	1
man	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
his	1
friends.	1
	1
15:14	1
Ye	1
are	1
my	1
friends,	1
if	1
ye	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
I	1
command	1
you.	1
	1
15:15	1
Henceforth	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
not	1
servants;	1
for	1
the	1
servant	1
knoweth	1
not	1
what	1
his	1
lord	1
doeth:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
you	1
friends;	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
Father	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
15:16	1
Ye	1
have	1
not	1
chosen	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you,	1
and	1
ordained	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
fruit	1
should	1
remain:	1
that	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
may	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
15:17	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
command	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
love	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:18	1
If	1
the	1
world	1
hate	1
you,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
hated	1
me	1
before	1
it	1
hated	1
you.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
ye	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
love	1
his	1
own:	1
but	1
because	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
therefore	1
the	1
world	1
hateth	1
you.	1
	1
15:20	1
Remember	1
the	1
word	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
unto	1
you,	1
The	1
servant	1
is	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
lord.	1
If	1
they	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me,	1
they	1
will	1
also	1
persecute	1
you;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
my	1
saying,	1
they	1
will	1
keep	1
yours	1
also.	1
	1
15:21	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
15:22	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
and	1
spoken	1
unto	1
them,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
cloak	1
for	1
their	1
sin.	1
	1
15:23	1
He	1
that	1
hateth	1
me	1
hateth	1
my	1
Father	1
also.	1
	1
15:24	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
works	1
which	1
none	1
other	1
man	1
did,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
sin:	1
but	1
now	1
have	1
they	1
both	1
seen	1
and	1
hated	1
both	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
Father.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
this	1
cometh	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
law,	1
They	1
hated	1
me	1
without	1
a	1
cause.	1
	1
15:26	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Comforter	1
is	1
come,	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
unto	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
which	1
proceedeth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
he	1
shall	1
testify	1
of	1
me:	1
15:27	1
And	1
ye	1
also	1
shall	1
bear	1
witness,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
16:1	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
offended.	1
	1
16:2	1
They	1
shall	1
put	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogues:	1
yea,	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
killeth	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
doeth	1
God	1
service.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
will	1
they	1
do	1
unto	1
you,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
known	1
the	1
Father,	1
nor	1
me.	1
	1
16:4	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
shall	1
come,	1
ye	1
may	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
16:5	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
sent	1
me;	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
asketh	1
me,	1
Whither	1
goest	1
thou?	1
	1
16:6	1
But	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
you,	1
sorrow	1
hath	1
filled	1
your	1
heart.	1
	1
16:7	1
Nevertheless	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth;	1
It	1
is	1
expedient	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
go	1
away:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
not	1
away,	1
the	1
Comforter	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
depart,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
him	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
reprove	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
sin,	1
and	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
of	1
judgment:	1
16:9	1
Of	1
sin,	1
because	1
they	1
believe	1
not	1
on	1
me;	1
16:10	1
Of	1
righteousness,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
ye	1
see	1
me	1
no	1
more;	1
16:11	1
Of	1
judgment,	1
because	1
the	1
prince	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
judged.	1
	1
16:12	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
many	1
things	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
ye	1
cannot	1
bear	1
them	1
now.	1
	1
16:13	1
Howbeit	1
when	1
he,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
truth,	1
is	1
come,	1
he	1
will	1
guide	1
you	1
into	1
all	1
truth:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
himself;	1
but	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
hear,	1
that	1
shall	1
he	1
speak:	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
shew	1
you	1
things	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
16:14	1
He	1
shall	1
glorify	1
me:	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:15	1
All	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
are	1
mine:	1
therefore	1
said	1
I,	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
shall	1
shew	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
16:16	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me,	1
because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:17	1
Then	1
said	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
disciples	1
among	1
themselves,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
us,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me:	1
and,	1
Because	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father?	1
	1
16:18	1
They	1
said	1
therefore,	1
What	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
saith,	1
A	1
little	1
while?	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell	1
what	1
he	1
saith.	1
	1
16:19	1
Now	1
Jesus	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
desirous	1
to	1
ask	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
enquire	1
among	1
yourselves	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
said,	1
A	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
not	1
see	1
me:	1
and	1
again,	1
a	1
little	1
while,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
me?	1
	1
16:20	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
ye	1
shall	1
weep	1
and	1
lament,	1
but	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
rejoice:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
sorrowful,	1
but	1
your	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
joy.	1
	1
16:21	1
A	1
woman	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
travail	1
hath	1
sorrow,	1
because	1
her	1
hour	1
is	1
come:	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
delivered	1
of	1
the	1
child,	1
she	1
remembereth	1
no	1
more	1
the	1
anguish,	1
for	1
joy	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
ye	1
now	1
therefore	1
have	1
sorrow:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
you	1
again,	1
and	1
your	1
heart	1
shall	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
your	1
joy	1
no	1
man	1
taketh	1
from	1
you.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
me	1
nothing.	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Whatsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
the	1
Father	1
in	1
my	1
name,	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
you.	1
	1
16:24	1
Hitherto	1
have	1
ye	1
asked	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
ask,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive,	1
that	1
your	1
joy	1
may	1
be	1
full.	1
	1
16:25	1
These	1
things	1
have	1
I	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs:	1
but	1
the	1
time	1
cometh,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
no	1
more	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
proverbs,	1
but	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
you	1
plainly	1
of	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:26	1
At	1
that	1
day	1
ye	1
shall	1
ask	1
in	1
my	1
name:	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
the	1
Father	1
for	1
you:	1
16:27	1
For	1
the	1
Father	1
himself	1
loveth	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
have	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:28	1
I	1
came	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
Father,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world:	1
again,	1
I	1
leave	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Father.	1
	1
16:29	1
His	1
disciples	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lo,	1
now	1
speakest	1
thou	1
plainly,	1
and	1
speakest	1
no	1
proverb.	1
	1
16:30	1
Now	1
are	1
we	1
sure	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
needest	1
not	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
ask	1
thee:	1
by	1
this	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
camest	1
forth	1
from	1
God.	1
	1
16:31	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
them,	1
Do	1
ye	1
now	1
believe?	1
	1
16:32	1
Behold,	1
the	1
hour	1
cometh,	1
yea,	1
is	1
now	1
come,	1
that	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
scattered,	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
shall	1
leave	1
me	1
alone:	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
alone,	1
because	1
the	1
Father	1
is	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
16:33	1
These	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
peace.	1
	1
In	1
the	1
world	1
ye	1
shall	1
have	1
tribulation:	1
but	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
I	1
have	1
overcome	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:1	1
These	1
words	1
spake	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
said,	1
Father,	1
the	1
hour	1
is	1
come;	1
glorify	1
thy	1
Son,	1
that	1
thy	1
Son	1
also	1
may	1
glorify	1
thee:	1
17:2	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him	1
power	1
over	1
all	1
flesh,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
eternal	1
life	1
to	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
him.	1
	1
17:3	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
life	1
eternal,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
know	1
thee	1
the	1
only	1
true	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent.	1
	1
17:4	1
I	1
have	1
glorified	1
thee	1
on	1
the	1
earth:	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
17:5	1
And	1
now,	1
O	1
Father,	1
glorify	1
thou	1
me	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
self	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
thee	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
was.	1
	1
17:6	1
I	1
have	1
manifested	1
thy	1
name	1
unto	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world:	1
thine	1
they	1
were,	1
and	1
thou	1
gavest	1
them	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
kept	1
thy	1
word.	1
	1
17:7	1
Now	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
are	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
17:8	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
unto	1
them	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
known	1
surely	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
thee,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
believed	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
me.	1
	1
17:9	1
I	1
pray	1
for	1
them:	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
thine.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
all	1
mine	1
are	1
thine,	1
and	1
thine	1
are	1
mine;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
glorified	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
17:11	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
thee.	1
Holy	1
Father,	1
keep	1
through	1
thine	1
own	1
name	1
those	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
as	1
we	1
are.	1
	1
17:12	1
While	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
thy	1
name:	1
those	1
that	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
kept,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
lost,	1
but	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
perdition;	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
17:13	1
And	1
now	1
come	1
I	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
my	1
joy	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
themselves.	1
	1
17:14	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
thy	1
word;	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
hated	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:15	1
I	1
pray	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
evil.	1
	1
17:16	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:17	1
Sanctify	1
them	1
through	1
thy	1
truth:	1
thy	1
word	1
is	1
truth.	1
	1
17:18	1
As	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
even	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
also	1
sent	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
I	1
sanctify	1
myself,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
might	1
be	1
sanctified	1
through	1
the	1
truth.	1
	1
17:20	1
Neither	1
pray	1
I	1
for	1
these	1
alone,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
shall	1
believe	1
on	1
me	1
through	1
their	1
word;	1
17:21	1
That	1
they	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
one;	1
as	1
thou,	1
Father,	1
art	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
thee,	1
that	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
us:	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:22	1
And	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
them;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
one,	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
one:	1
17:23	1
I	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
in	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
perfect	1
in	1
one;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
hast	1
loved	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me.	1
	1
17:24	1
Father,	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
they	1
also,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
be	1
with	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
am;	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
behold	1
my	1
glory,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me:	1
for	1
thou	1
lovedst	1
me	1
before	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
17:25	1
O	1
righteous	1
Father,	1
the	1
world	1
hath	1
not	1
known	1
thee:	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
thee,	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
sent	1
me.	1
	1
17:26	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
thy	1
name,	1
and	1
will	1
declare	1
it:	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
hast	1
loved	1
me	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
When	1
Jesus	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
words,	1
he	1
went	1
forth	1
with	1
his	1
disciples	1
over	1
the	1
brook	1
Cedron,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
garden,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
entered,	1
and	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:2	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
knew	1
the	1
place:	1
for	1
Jesus	1
ofttimes	1
resorted	1
thither	1
with	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:3	1
Judas	1
then,	1
having	1
received	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
officers	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
Pharisees,	1
cometh	1
thither	1
with	1
lanterns	1
and	1
torches	1
and	1
weapons.	1
	1
18:4	1
Jesus	1
therefore,	1
knowing	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
	1
18:5	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he.	1
	1
And	1
Judas	1
also,	1
which	1
betrayed	1
him,	1
stood	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:6	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
am	1
he,	1
they	1
went	1
backward,	1
and	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
	1
18:7	1
Then	1
asked	1
he	1
them	1
again,	1
Whom	1
seek	1
ye?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
18:8	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
he:	1
if	1
therefore	1
ye	1
seek	1
me,	1
let	1
these	1
go	1
their	1
way:	1
18:9	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
Of	1
them	1
which	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
have	1
I	1
lost	1
none.	1
	1
18:10	1
Then	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
having	1
a	1
sword	1
drew	1
it,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
high	1
priest's	1
servant,	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
right	1
ear.	1
The	1
servant's	1
name	1
was	1
Malchus.	1
	1
18:11	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Put	1
up	1
thy	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
sheath:	1
the	1
cup	1
which	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
given	1
me,	1
shall	1
I	1
not	1
drink	1
it?	1
	1
18:12	1
Then	1
the	1
band	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
bound	1
him,	1
18:13	1
And	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
Annas	1
first;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
father	1
in	1
law	1
to	1
Caiaphas,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
that	1
same	1
year.	1
	1
18:14	1
Now	1
Caiaphas	1
was	1
he,	1
which	1
gave	1
counsel	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
expedient	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
should	1
die	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
18:15	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
followed	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
another	1
disciple:	1
that	1
disciple	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
without.	1
Then	1
went	1
out	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
her	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
Peter.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
saith	1
the	1
damsel	1
that	1
kept	1
the	1
door	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
man's	1
disciples?	1
He	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
officers	1
stood	1
there,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
cold:	1
and	1
they	1
warmed	1
themselves:	1
and	1
Peter	1
stood	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
	1
18:19	1
The	1
high	1
priest	1
then	1
asked	1
Jesus	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
doctrine.	1
	1
18:20	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
I	1
spake	1
openly	1
to	1
the	1
world;	1
I	1
ever	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
whither	1
the	1
Jews	1
always	1
resort;	1
and	1
in	1
secret	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
nothing.	1
	1
18:21	1
Why	1
askest	1
thou	1
me?	1
ask	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
me,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
unto	1
them:	1
behold,	1
they	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
said.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
which	1
stood	1
by	1
struck	1
Jesus	1
with	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
saying,	1
Answerest	1
thou	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
so?	1
	1
18:23	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
evil,	1
bear	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
evil:	1
but	1
if	1
well,	1
why	1
smitest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
18:24	1
Now	1
Annas	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
bound	1
unto	1
Caiaphas	1
the	1
high	1
priest.	1
	1
18:25	1
And	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
stood	1
and	1
warmed	1
himself.	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
disciples?	1
He	1
denied	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not.	1
	1
18:26	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
being	1
his	1
kinsman	1
whose	1
ear	1
Peter	1
cut	1
off,	1
saith,	1
Did	1
not	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
with	1
him?	1
18:27	1
Peter	1
then	1
denied	1
again:	1
and	1
immediately	1
the	1
cock	1
crew.	1
	1
18:28	1
Then	1
led	1
they	1
Jesus	1
from	1
Caiaphas	1
unto	1
the	1
hall	1
of	1
judgment:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
early;	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
went	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
defiled;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
eat	1
the	1
passover.	1
	1
18:29	1
Pilate	1
then	1
went	1
out	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
accusation	1
bring	1
ye	1
against	1
this	1
man?	1
	1
18:30	1
They	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
malefactor,	1
we	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
18:31	1
Then	1
said	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
judge	1
him	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
law.	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
put	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
death:	1
18:32	1
That	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
Jesus	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
signifying	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
die.	1
	1
18:33	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall	1
again,	1
and	1
called	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:34	1
Jesus	1
answered	1
him,	1
Sayest	1
thou	1
this	1
thing	1
of	1
thyself,	1
or	1
did	1
others	1
tell	1
it	1
thee	1
of	1
me?	1
	1
18:35	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
Am	1
I	1
a	1
Jew?	1
Thine	1
own	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
have	1
delivered	1
thee	1
unto	1
me:	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
done?	1
18:36	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
My	1
kingdom	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
this	1
world:	1
if	1
my	1
kingdom	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
then	1
would	1
my	1
servants	1
fight,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
delivered	1
to	1
the	1
Jews:	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
my	1
kingdom	1
not	1
from	1
hence.	1
	1
18:37	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Art	1
thou	1
a	1
king	1
then?	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
sayest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
king.	1
To	1
this	1
end	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
came	1
I	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
witness	1
unto	1
the	1
truth.	1
Every	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
heareth	1
my	1
voice.	1
	1
18:38	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
truth?	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
again	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
no	1
fault	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
18:39	1
But	1
ye	1
have	1
a	1
custom,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
passover:	1
will	1
ye	1
therefore	1
that	1
I	1
release	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews?	1
	1
18:40	1
Then	1
cried	1
they	1
all	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Not	1
this	1
man,	1
but	1
Barabbas.	1
Now	1
Barabbas	1
was	1
a	1
robber.	1
	1
19:1	1
Then	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
scourged	1
him.	1
	1
19:2	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers	1
platted	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
they	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
purple	1
robe,	1
19:3	1
And	1
said,	1
Hail,	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews!	1
and	1
they	1
smote	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
19:4	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth	1
again,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:5	1
Then	1
came	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
wearing	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
thorns,	1
and	1
the	1
purple	1
robe.	1
And	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Behold	1
the	1
man!	1
	1
19:6	1
When	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
therefore	1
and	1
officers	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Crucify	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Take	1
ye	1
him,	1
and	1
crucify	1
him:	1
for	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
fault	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
19:7	1
The	1
Jews	1
answered	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
by	1
our	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die,	1
because	1
he	1
made	1
himself	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:8	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
afraid;	1
19:9	1
And	1
went	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
judgment	1
hall,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
Jesus,	1
Whence	1
art	1
thou?	1
But	1
Jesus	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
	1
19:10	1
Then	1
saith	1
Pilate	1
unto	1
him,	1
Speakest	1
thou	1
not	1
unto	1
me?	1
knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
crucify	1
thee,	1
and	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
release	1
thee?	1
	1
19:11	1
Jesus	1
answered,	1
Thou	1
couldest	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
me,	1
except	1
it	1
were	1
given	1
thee	1
from	1
above:	1
therefore	1
he	1
that	1
delivered	1
me	1
unto	1
thee	1
hath	1
the	1
greater	1
sin.	1
	1
19:12	1
And	1
from	1
thenceforth	1
Pilate	1
sought	1
to	1
release	1
him:	1
but	1
the	1
Jews	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
If	1
thou	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
go,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
Caesar's	1
friend:	1
whosoever	1
maketh	1
himself	1
a	1
king	1
speaketh	1
against	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:13	1
When	1
Pilate	1
therefore	1
heard	1
that	1
saying,	1
he	1
brought	1
Jesus	1
forth,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Pavement,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew,	1
Gabbatha.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation	1
of	1
the	1
passover,	1
and	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
and	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
Behold	1
your	1
King!	1
	1
19:15	1
But	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
Away	1
with	1
him,	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
crucify	1
him.	1
	1
Pilate	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Shall	1
I	1
crucify	1
your	1
King?	1
The	1
chief	1
priests	1
answered,	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
king	1
but	1
Caesar.	1
	1
19:16	1
Then	1
delivered	1
he	1
him	1
therefore	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
crucified.	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
he	1
bearing	1
his	1
cross	1
went	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
skull,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
Golgotha:	1
19:18	1
Where	1
they	1
crucified	1
him,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
with	1
him,	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
one,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
midst.	1
	1
19:19	1
And	1
Pilate	1
wrote	1
a	1
title,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
cross.	1
And	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
JESUS	1
OF	1
NAZARETH	1
THE	1
KING	1
OF	1
THE	1
JEWS.	1
	1
19:20	1
This	1
title	1
then	1
read	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Jesus	1
was	1
crucified	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
Hebrew,	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
Latin.	1
	1
19:21	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
to	1
Pilate,	1
Write	1
not,	1
The	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
King	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
19:22	1
Pilate	1
answered,	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
I	1
have	1
written.	1
	1
19:23	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crucified	1
Jesus,	1
took	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
made	1
four	1
parts,	1
to	1
every	1
soldier	1
a	1
part;	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
coat:	1
now	1
the	1
coat	1
was	1
without	1
seam,	1
woven	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
throughout.	1
	1
19:24	1
They	1
said	1
therefore	1
among	1
themselves,	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
rend	1
it,	1
but	1
cast	1
lots	1
for	1
it,	1
whose	1
it	1
shall	1
be:	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
saith,	1
They	1
parted	1
my	1
raiment	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
vesture	1
they	1
did	1
cast	1
lots.	1
These	1
things	1
therefore	1
the	1
soldiers	1
did.	1
	1
19:25	1
Now	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Jesus	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
his	1
mother's	1
sister,	1
Mary	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Cleophas,	1
and	1
Mary	1
Magdalene.	1
	1
19:26	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
saw	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
disciple	1
standing	1
by,	1
whom	1
he	1
loved,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
his	1
mother,	1
Woman,	1
behold	1
thy	1
son!	1
19:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
disciple,	1
Behold	1
thy	1
mother!	1
And	1
from	1
that	1
hour	1
that	1
disciple	1
took	1
her	1
unto	1
his	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
19:28	1
After	1
this,	1
Jesus	1
knowing	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
now	1
accomplished,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
saith,	1
I	1
thirst.	1
	1
19:29	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
set	1
a	1
vessel	1
full	1
of	1
vinegar:	1
and	1
they	1
filled	1
a	1
spunge	1
with	1
vinegar,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
upon	1
hyssop,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
19:30	1
When	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
vinegar,	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
finished:	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
19:31	1
The	1
Jews	1
therefore,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
preparation,	1
that	1
the	1
bodies	1
should	1
not	1
remain	1
upon	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
(for	1
that	1
sabbath	1
day	1
was	1
an	1
high	1
day,)	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
their	1
legs	1
might	1
be	1
broken,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
19:32	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
brake	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
was	1
crucified	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
19:33	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
already,	1
they	1
brake	1
not	1
his	1
legs:	1
19:34	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
with	1
a	1
spear	1
pierced	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
came	1
there	1
out	1
blood	1
and	1
water.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
saw	1
it	1
bare	1
record,	1
and	1
his	1
record	1
is	1
true:	1
and	1
he	1
knoweth	1
that	1
he	1
saith	1
true,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe.	1
	1
19:36	1
For	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
done,	1
that	1
the	1
scripture	1
should	1
be	1
fulfilled,	1
A	1
bone	1
of	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
broken.	1
	1
19:37	1
And	1
again	1
another	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
They	1
shall	1
look	1
on	1
him	1
whom	1
they	1
pierced.	1
	1
19:38	1
And	1
after	1
this	1
Joseph	1
of	1
Arimathaea,	1
being	1
a	1
disciple	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
but	1
secretly	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
besought	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
Pilate	1
gave	1
him	1
leave.	1
He	1
came	1
therefore,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:39	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
Nicodemus,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Jesus	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
myrrh	1
and	1
aloes,	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
pound	1
weight.	1
	1
19:40	1
Then	1
took	1
they	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
wound	1
it	1
in	1
linen	1
clothes	1
with	1
the	1
spices,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
is	1
to	1
bury.	1
	1
19:41	1
Now	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
crucified	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
garden;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
a	1
new	1
sepulchre,	1
wherein	1
was	1
never	1
man	1
yet	1
laid.	1
	1
19:42	1
There	1
laid	1
they	1
Jesus	1
therefore	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews'	1
preparation	1
day;	1
for	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
was	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand.	1
	1
20:1	1
The	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
cometh	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
early,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
dark,	1
unto	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
stone	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:2	1
Then	1
she	1
runneth,	1
and	1
cometh	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
disciple,	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
the	1
LORD	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:3	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:4	1
So	1
they	1
ran	1
both	1
together:	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
disciple	1
did	1
outrun	1
Peter,	1
and	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
20:5	1
And	1
he	1
stooping	1
down,	1
and	1
looking	1
in,	1
saw	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lying;	1
yet	1
went	1
he	1
not	1
in.	1
	1
20:6	1
Then	1
cometh	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
following	1
him,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
seeth	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes	1
lie,	1
20:7	1
And	1
the	1
napkin,	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
his	1
head,	1
not	1
lying	1
with	1
the	1
linen	1
clothes,	1
but	1
wrapped	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
by	1
itself.	1
	1
20:8	1
Then	1
went	1
in	1
also	1
that	1
other	1
disciple,	1
which	1
came	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
and	1
he	1
saw,	1
and	1
believed.	1
	1
20:9	1
For	1
as	1
yet	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
scripture,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
rise	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
went	1
away	1
again	1
unto	1
their	1
own	1
home.	1
	1
20:11	1
But	1
Mary	1
stood	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
weeping:	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
wept,	1
she	1
stooped	1
down,	1
and	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
20:12	1
And	1
seeth	1
two	1
angels	1
in	1
white	1
sitting,	1
the	1
one	1
at	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
the	1
feet,	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Jesus	1
had	1
lain.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
they	1
say	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
She	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Because	1
they	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
LORD,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
laid	1
him.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
thus	1
said,	1
she	1
turned	1
herself	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
Jesus	1
standing,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
20:15	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Woman,	1
why	1
weepest	1
thou?	1
whom	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
	1
She,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
gardener,	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Sir,	1
if	1
thou	1
have	1
borne	1
him	1
hence,	1
tell	1
me	1
where	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
him	1
away.	1
	1
20:16	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Mary.	1
She	1
turned	1
herself,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Rabboni;	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Master.	1
	1
20:17	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
her,	1
Touch	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
ascended	1
to	1
my	1
Father:	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
brethren,	1
and	1
say	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
ascend	1
unto	1
my	1
Father,	1
and	1
your	1
Father;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
God,	1
and	1
your	1
God.	1
	1
20:18	1
Mary	1
Magdalene	1
came	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
disciples	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
her.	1
	1
20:19	1
Then	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
at	1
evening,	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut	1
where	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
assembled	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
came	1
Jesus	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:20	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
he	1
shewed	1
unto	1
them	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
his	1
side.	1
	1
Then	1
were	1
the	1
disciples	1
glad,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
20:21	1
Then	1
said	1
Jesus	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you:	1
as	1
my	1
Father	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
even	1
so	1
send	1
I	1
you.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
breathed	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Receive	1
ye	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
20:23	1
Whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
remit,	1
they	1
are	1
remitted	1
unto	1
them;	1
and	1
whose	1
soever	1
sins	1
ye	1
retain,	1
they	1
are	1
retained.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
Thomas,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve,	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
when	1
Jesus	1
came.	1
	1
20:25	1
The	1
other	1
disciples	1
therefore	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
But	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Except	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
put	1
my	1
finger	1
into	1
the	1
print	1
of	1
the	1
nails,	1
and	1
thrust	1
my	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
side,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
believe.	1
	1
20:26	1
And	1
after	1
eight	1
days	1
again	1
his	1
disciples	1
were	1
within,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
with	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
Jesus,	1
the	1
doors	1
being	1
shut,	1
and	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
said,	1
Peace	1
be	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
20:27	1
Then	1
saith	1
he	1
to	1
Thomas,	1
Reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
behold	1
my	1
hands;	1
and	1
reach	1
hither	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
side:	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
faithless,	1
but	1
believing.	1
	1
20:28	1
And	1
Thomas	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
My	1
LORD	1
and	1
my	1
God.	1
	1
20:29	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thomas,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me,	1
thou	1
hast	1
believed:	1
blessed	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
seen,	1
and	1
yet	1
have	1
believed.	1
	1
20:30	1
And	1
many	1
other	1
signs	1
truly	1
did	1
Jesus	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
disciples,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
this	1
book:	1
20:31	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
written,	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Christ,	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God;	1
and	1
that	1
believing	1
ye	1
might	1
have	1
life	1
through	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
21:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
disciples	1
at	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Tiberias;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
wise	1
shewed	1
he	1
himself.	1
	1
21:2	1
There	1
were	1
together	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
and	1
Thomas	1
called	1
Didymus,	1
and	1
Nathanael	1
of	1
Cana	1
in	1
Galilee,	1
and	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Zebedee,	1
and	1
two	1
other	1
of	1
his	1
disciples.	1
	1
21:3	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
I	1
go	1
a	1
fishing.	1
They	1
say	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
also	1
go	1
with	1
thee.	1
They	1
went	1
forth,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
immediately;	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
caught	1
nothing.	1
	1
21:4	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
morning	1
was	1
now	1
come,	1
Jesus	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
shore:	1
but	1
the	1
disciples	1
knew	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:5	1
Then	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Children,	1
have	1
ye	1
any	1
meat?	1
They	1
answered	1
him,	1
No.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Cast	1
the	1
net	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
find.	1
They	1
cast	1
therefore,	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:7	1
Therefore	1
that	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
saith	1
unto	1
Peter,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Now	1
when	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord,	1
he	1
girt	1
his	1
fisher's	1
coat	1
unto	1
him,	1
(for	1
he	1
was	1
naked,)	1
and	1
did	1
cast	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
other	1
disciples	1
came	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
ship;	1
(for	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
land,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
hundred	1
cubits,)	1
dragging	1
the	1
net	1
with	1
fishes.	1
	1
21:9	1
As	1
soon	1
then	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
land,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
fire	1
of	1
coals	1
there,	1
and	1
fish	1
laid	1
thereon,	1
and	1
bread.	1
	1
21:10	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Bring	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
now	1
caught.	1
	1
21:11	1
Simon	1
Peter	1
went	1
up,	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
net	1
to	1
land	1
full	1
of	1
great	1
fishes,	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
and	1
three:	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many,	1
yet	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
net	1
broken.	1
	1
21:12	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
them,	1
Come	1
and	1
dine.	1
And	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
durst	1
ask	1
him,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou?	1
knowing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
21:13	1
Jesus	1
then	1
cometh,	1
and	1
taketh	1
bread,	1
and	1
giveth	1
them,	1
and	1
fish	1
likewise.	1
	1
21:14	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
that	1
Jesus	1
shewed	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
disciples,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
21:15	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
to	1
Simon	1
Peter,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
these?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
lambs.	1
	1
21:16	1
He	1
saith	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Yea,	1
Lord;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:17	1
He	1
saith	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Simon,	1
son	1
of	1
Jonas,	1
lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
Peter	1
was	1
grieved	1
because	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
Lovest	1
thou	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
things;	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
thee.	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Feed	1
my	1
sheep.	1
	1
21:18	1
Verily,	1
verily,	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
thee,	1
When	1
thou	1
wast	1
young,	1
thou	1
girdest	1
thyself,	1
and	1
walkedst	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest:	1
but	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
old,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
stretch	1
forth	1
thy	1
hands,	1
and	1
another	1
shall	1
gird	1
thee,	1
and	1
carry	1
thee	1
whither	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
not.	1
	1
21:19	1
This	1
spake	1
he,	1
signifying	1
by	1
what	1
death	1
he	1
should	1
glorify	1
God.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
this,	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Follow	1
me.	1
	1
21:20	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
turning	1
about,	1
seeth	1
the	1
disciple	1
whom	1
Jesus	1
loved	1
following;	1
which	1
also	1
leaned	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
at	1
supper,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
betrayeth	1
thee?	1
	1
21:21	1
Peter	1
seeing	1
him	1
saith	1
to	1
Jesus,	1
Lord,	1
and	1
what	1
shall	1
this	1
man	1
do?	1
	1
21:22	1
Jesus	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
follow	1
thou	1
me.	1
	1
21:23	1
Then	1
went	1
this	1
saying	1
abroad	1
among	1
the	1
brethren,	1
that	1
that	1
disciple	1
should	1
not	1
die:	1
yet	1
Jesus	1
said	1
not	1
unto	1
him,	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
die;	1
but,	1
If	1
I	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
tarry	1
till	1
I	1
come,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
thee?	1
21:24	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
disciple	1
which	1
testifieth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
wrote	1
these	1
things:	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
testimony	1
is	1
true.	1
	1
21:25	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
Jesus	1
did,	1
the	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
written	1
every	1
one,	1
I	1
suppose	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
world	1
itself	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
written.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
Acts	1
of	1
the	1
Apostles	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
The	1
former	1
treatise	1
have	1
I	1
made,	1
O	1
Theophilus,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Jesus	1
began	1
both	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
teach,	1
1:2	1
Until	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
through	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
had	1
given	1
commandments	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
chosen:	1
1:3	1
To	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
alive	1
after	1
his	1
passion	1
by	1
many	1
infallible	1
proofs,	1
being	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
forty	1
days,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God:	1
1:4	1
And,	1
being	1
assembled	1
together	1
with	1
them,	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
but	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
which,	1
saith	1
he,	1
ye	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
1:5	1
For	1
John	1
truly	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
hence.	1
	1
1:6	1
When	1
they	1
therefore	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
they	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Lord,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
restore	1
again	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
Israel?	1
	1
1:7	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
times	1
or	1
the	1
seasons,	1
which	1
the	1
Father	1
hath	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
1:8	1
But	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
power,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
is	1
come	1
upon	1
you:	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
me	1
both	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
in	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
uttermost	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
1:9	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
these	1
things,	1
while	1
they	1
beheld,	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up;	1
and	1
a	1
cloud	1
received	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
	1
1:10	1
And	1
while	1
they	1
looked	1
stedfastly	1
toward	1
heaven	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
up,	1
behold,	1
two	1
men	1
stood	1
by	1
them	1
in	1
white	1
apparel;	1
1:11	1
Which	1
also	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Galilee,	1
why	1
stand	1
ye	1
gazing	1
up	1
into	1
heaven?	1
this	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
you	1
into	1
heaven,	1
shall	1
so	1
come	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
go	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
1:12	1
Then	1
returned	1
they	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
from	1
the	1
mount	1
called	1
Olivet,	1
which	1
is	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
a	1
sabbath	1
day's	1
journey.	1
	1
1:13	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
in,	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
into	1
an	1
upper	1
room,	1
where	1
abode	1
both	1
Peter,	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Andrew,	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Thomas,	1
Bartholomew,	1
and	1
Matthew,	1
James	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Alphaeus,	1
and	1
Simon	1
Zelotes,	1
and	1
Judas	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
James.	1
	1
1:14	1
These	1
all	1
continued	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
prayer	1
and	1
supplication,	1
with	1
the	1
women,	1
and	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
brethren.	1
	1
1:15	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
Peter	1
stood	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
said,	1
(the	1
number	1
of	1
names	1
together	1
were	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty,)	1
1:16	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
this	1
scripture	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
been	1
fulfilled,	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
David	1
spake	1
before	1
concerning	1
Judas,	1
which	1
was	1
guide	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
took	1
Jesus.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
had	1
obtained	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry.	1
	1
1:18	1
Now	1
this	1
man	1
purchased	1
a	1
field	1
with	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
iniquity;	1
and	1
falling	1
headlong,	1
he	1
burst	1
asunder	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
bowels	1
gushed	1
out.	1
	1
1:19	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
dwellers	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
insomuch	1
as	1
that	1
field	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
tongue,	1
Aceldama,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
The	1
field	1
of	1
blood.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
Psalms,	1
Let	1
his	1
habitation	1
be	1
desolate,	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
dwell	1
therein:	1
and	1
his	1
bishoprick	1
let	1
another	1
take.	1
	1
1:21	1
Wherefore	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
companied	1
with	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
went	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
among	1
us,	1
1:22	1
Beginning	1
from	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John,	1
unto	1
that	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
from	1
us,	1
must	1
one	1
be	1
ordained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
with	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection.	1
	1
1:23	1
And	1
they	1
appointed	1
two,	1
Joseph	1
called	1
Barsabas,	1
who	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Justus,	1
and	1
Matthias.	1
	1
1:24	1
And	1
they	1
prayed,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thou,	1
Lord,	1
which	1
knowest	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
men,	1
shew	1
whether	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen,	1
1:25	1
That	1
he	1
may	1
take	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
ministry	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
from	1
which	1
Judas	1
by	1
transgression	1
fell,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
place.	1
	1
1:26	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
forth	1
their	1
lots;	1
and	1
the	1
lot	1
fell	1
upon	1
Matthias;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
numbered	1
with	1
the	1
eleven	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost	1
was	1
fully	1
come,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
	1
2:2	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
sound	1
from	1
heaven	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
rushing	1
mighty	1
wind,	1
and	1
it	1
filled	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
sitting.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
there	1
appeared	1
unto	1
them	1
cloven	1
tongues	1
like	1
as	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
it	1
sat	1
upon	1
each	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
other	1
tongues,	1
as	1
the	1
Spirit	1
gave	1
them	1
utterance.	1
	1
2:5	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
Jews,	1
devout	1
men,	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
nation	1
under	1
heaven.	1
	1
2:6	1
Now	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
noised	1
abroad,	1
the	1
multitude	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
were	1
confounded,	1
because	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language.	1
	1
2:7	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed	1
and	1
marvelled,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
Behold,	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
these	1
which	1
speak	1
Galilaeans?	1
	1
2:8	1
And	1
how	1
hear	1
we	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
tongue,	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
born?	1
	1
2:9	1
Parthians,	1
and	1
Medes,	1
and	1
Elamites,	1
and	1
the	1
dwellers	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
and	1
in	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
Cappadocia,	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
and	1
Asia,	1
2:10	1
Phrygia,	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Libya	1
about	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
strangers	1
of	1
Rome,	1
Jews	1
and	1
proselytes,	1
2:11	1
Cretes	1
and	1
Arabians,	1
we	1
do	1
hear	1
them	1
speak	1
in	1
our	1
tongues	1
the	1
wonderful	1
works	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
amazed,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
doubt,	1
saying	1
one	1
to	1
another,	1
What	1
meaneth	1
this?	1
	1
2:13	1
Others	1
mocking	1
said,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
new	1
wine.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
Peter,	1
standing	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
eleven,	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
all	1
ye	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
be	1
this	1
known	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
hearken	1
to	1
my	1
words:	1
2:15	1
For	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
drunken,	1
as	1
ye	1
suppose,	1
seeing	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
2:16	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
prophet	1
Joel;	1
2:17	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
days,	1
saith	1
God,	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit	1
upon	1
all	1
flesh:	1
and	1
your	1
sons	1
and	1
your	1
daughters	1
shall	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
your	1
young	1
men	1
shall	1
see	1
visions,	1
and	1
your	1
old	1
men	1
shall	1
dream	1
dreams:	1
2:18	1
And	1
on	1
my	1
servants	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
handmaidens	1
I	1
will	1
pour	1
out	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
Spirit;	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
prophesy:	1
2:19	1
And	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
wonders	1
in	1
heaven	1
above,	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
beneath;	1
blood,	1
and	1
fire,	1
and	1
vapour	1
of	1
smoke:	1
2:20	1
The	1
sun	1
shall	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
darkness,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
into	1
blood,	1
before	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
notable	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
come:	1
2:21	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
2:22	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
hear	1
these	1
words;	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
a	1
man	1
approved	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
you	1
by	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs,	1
which	1
God	1
did	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
you,	1
as	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
also	1
know:	1
2:23	1
Him,	1
being	1
delivered	1
by	1
the	1
determinate	1
counsel	1
and	1
foreknowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
taken,	1
and	1
by	1
wicked	1
hands	1
have	1
crucified	1
and	1
slain:	1
2:24	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
up,	1
having	1
loosed	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
death:	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
holden	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
David	1
speaketh	1
concerning	1
him,	1
I	1
foresaw	1
the	1
Lord	1
always	1
before	1
my	1
face,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
moved:	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
did	1
my	1
heart	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
was	1
glad;	1
moreover	1
also	1
my	1
flesh	1
shall	1
rest	1
in	1
hope:	1
2:27	1
Because	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
leave	1
my	1
soul	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
wilt	1
thou	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:28	1
Thou	1
hast	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
life;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
make	1
me	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
with	1
thy	1
countenance.	1
	1
2:29	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
let	1
me	1
freely	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
patriarch	1
David,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
both	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
and	1
his	1
sepulchre	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
2:30	1
Therefore	1
being	1
a	1
prophet,	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
with	1
an	1
oath	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
loins,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
he	1
would	1
raise	1
up	1
Christ	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
his	1
throne;	1
2:31	1
He	1
seeing	1
this	1
before	1
spake	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Christ,	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
in	1
hell,	1
neither	1
his	1
flesh	1
did	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
2:32	1
This	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
God	1
raised	1
up,	1
whereof	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
2:33	1
Therefore	1
being	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God	1
exalted,	1
and	1
having	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Father	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
he	1
hath	1
shed	1
forth	1
this,	1
which	1
ye	1
now	1
see	1
and	1
hear.	1
	1
2:34	1
For	1
David	1
is	1
not	1
ascended	1
into	1
the	1
heavens:	1
but	1
he	1
saith	1
himself,	1
The	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
my	1
Lord,	1
Sit	1
thou	1
on	1
my	1
right	1
hand,	1
2:35	1
Until	1
I	1
make	1
thy	1
foes	1
thy	1
footstool.	1
	1
2:36	1
Therefore	1
let	1
all	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Israel	1
know	1
assuredly,	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
crucified,	1
both	1
Lord	1
and	1
Christ.	1
	1
2:37	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
pricked	1
in	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
Peter	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do?	1
	1
2:38	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Repent,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
ye	1
shall	1
receive	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
2:39	1
For	1
the	1
promise	1
is	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
your	1
children,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
afar	1
off,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
LORD	1
our	1
God	1
shall	1
call.	1
	1
2:40	1
And	1
with	1
many	1
other	1
words	1
did	1
he	1
testify	1
and	1
exhort,	1
saying,	1
Save	1
yourselves	1
from	1
this	1
untoward	1
generation.	1
	1
2:41	1
Then	1
they	1
that	1
gladly	1
received	1
his	1
word	1
were	1
baptized:	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
there	1
were	1
added	1
unto	1
them	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
souls.	1
	1
2:42	1
And	1
they	1
continued	1
stedfastly	1
in	1
the	1
apostles'	1
doctrine	1
and	1
fellowship,	1
and	1
in	1
breaking	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
in	1
prayers.	1
	1
2:43	1
And	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
every	1
soul:	1
and	1
many	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
were	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
2:44	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
together,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common;	1
2:45	1
And	1
sold	1
their	1
possessions	1
and	1
goods,	1
and	1
parted	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
as	1
every	1
man	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
2:46	1
And	1
they,	1
continuing	1
daily	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
breaking	1
bread	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
did	1
eat	1
their	1
meat	1
with	1
gladness	1
and	1
singleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
2:47	1
Praising	1
God,	1
and	1
having	1
favour	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
daily	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
3:1	1
Now	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
went	1
up	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
prayer,	1
being	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour.	1
	1
3:2	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
lame	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb	1
was	1
carried,	1
whom	1
they	1
laid	1
daily	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Beautiful,	1
to	1
ask	1
alms	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple;	1
3:3	1
Who	1
seeing	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
asked	1
an	1
alms.	1
	1
3:4	1
And	1
Peter,	1
fastening	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
John,	1
said,	1
Look	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
3:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
them,	1
expecting	1
to	1
receive	1
something	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
3:6	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Silver	1
and	1
gold	1
have	1
I	1
none;	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
give	1
I	1
thee:	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
rise	1
up	1
and	1
walk.	1
	1
3:7	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
up:	1
and	1
immediately	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
ankle	1
bones	1
received	1
strength.	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
he	1
leaping	1
up	1
stood,	1
and	1
walked,	1
and	1
entered	1
with	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
walking,	1
and	1
leaping,	1
and	1
praising	1
God.	1
	1
3:9	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
and	1
praising	1
God:	1
3:10	1
And	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
which	1
sat	1
for	1
alms	1
at	1
the	1
Beautiful	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
at	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
3:11	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
lame	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
held	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
porch	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Solomon's,	1
greatly	1
wondering.	1
	1
3:12	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
answered	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
why	1
marvel	1
ye	1
at	1
this?	1
or	1
why	1
look	1
ye	1
so	1
earnestly	1
on	1
us,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
power	1
or	1
holiness	1
we	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
walk?	1
3:13	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
of	1
Jacob,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
hath	1
glorified	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus;	1
whom	1
ye	1
delivered	1
up,	1
and	1
denied	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Pilate,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
go.	1
	1
3:14	1
But	1
ye	1
denied	1
the	1
Holy	1
One	1
and	1
the	1
Just,	1
and	1
desired	1
a	1
murderer	1
to	1
be	1
granted	1
unto	1
you;	1
3:15	1
And	1
killed	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
life,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
whereof	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses.	1
	1
3:16	1
And	1
his	1
name	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
name	1
hath	1
made	1
this	1
man	1
strong,	1
whom	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
know:	1
yea,	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
him	1
hath	1
given	1
him	1
this	1
perfect	1
soundness	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
you	1
all.	1
	1
3:17	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
wot	1
that	1
through	1
ignorance	1
ye	1
did	1
it,	1
as	1
did	1
also	1
your	1
rulers.	1
	1
3:18	1
But	1
those	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
before	1
had	1
shewed	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
prophets,	1
that	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
he	1
hath	1
so	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
3:19	1
Repent	1
ye	1
therefore,	1
and	1
be	1
converted,	1
that	1
your	1
sins	1
may	1
be	1
blotted	1
out,	1
when	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
refreshing	1
shall	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
he	1
shall	1
send	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
which	1
before	1
was	1
preached	1
unto	1
you:	1
3:21	1
Whom	1
the	1
heaven	1
must	1
receive	1
until	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
restitution	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
spoken	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
holy	1
prophets	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began.	1
	1
3:22	1
For	1
Moses	1
truly	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
whatsoever	1
he	1
shall	1
say	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
3:23	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
every	1
soul,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
that	1
prophet,	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
3:24	1
Yea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
from	1
Samuel	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
follow	1
after,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
spoken,	1
have	1
likewise	1
foretold	1
of	1
these	1
days.	1
	1
3:25	1
Ye	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
covenant	1
which	1
God	1
made	1
with	1
our	1
fathers,	1
saying	1
unto	1
Abraham,	1
And	1
in	1
thy	1
seed	1
shall	1
all	1
the	1
kindreds	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
be	1
blessed.	1
	1
3:26	1
Unto	1
you	1
first	1
God,	1
having	1
raised	1
up	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus,	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
bless	1
you,	1
in	1
turning	1
away	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
iniquities.	1
	1
4:1	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
priests,	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees,	1
came	1
upon	1
them,	1
4:2	1
Being	1
grieved	1
that	1
they	1
taught	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
preached	1
through	1
Jesus	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
4:3	1
And	1
they	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
hold	1
unto	1
the	1
next	1
day:	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
eventide.	1
	1
4:4	1
Howbeit	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
believed;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
was	1
about	1
five	1
thousand.	1
	1
4:5	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
that	1
their	1
rulers,	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
scribes,	1
4:6	1
And	1
Annas	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
and	1
Caiaphas,	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
Alexander,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
kindred	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
4:7	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
midst,	1
they	1
asked,	1
By	1
what	1
power,	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
name,	1
have	1
ye	1
done	1
this?	1
	1
4:8	1
Then	1
Peter,	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
elders	1
of	1
Israel,	1
4:9	1
If	1
we	1
this	1
day	1
be	1
examined	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
deed	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
impotent	1
man,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
is	1
made	1
whole;	1
4:10	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
ye	1
crucified,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
even	1
by	1
him	1
doth	1
this	1
man	1
stand	1
here	1
before	1
you	1
whole.	1
	1
4:11	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
stone	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
of	1
you	1
builders,	1
which	1
is	1
become	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
corner.	1
	1
4:12	1
Neither	1
is	1
there	1
salvation	1
in	1
any	1
other:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
name	1
under	1
heaven	1
given	1
among	1
men,	1
whereby	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
4:13	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Peter	1
and	1
John,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
unlearned	1
and	1
ignorant	1
men,	1
they	1
marvelled;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:14	1
And	1
beholding	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
was	1
healed	1
standing	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
could	1
say	1
nothing	1
against	1
it.	1
	1
4:15	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
they	1
conferred	1
among	1
themselves,	1
4:16	1
Saying,	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
these	1
men?	1
for	1
that	1
indeed	1
a	1
notable	1
miracle	1
hath	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
them	1
is	1
manifest	1
to	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it.	1
	1
4:17	1
But	1
that	1
it	1
spread	1
no	1
further	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
let	1
us	1
straitly	1
threaten	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
speak	1
henceforth	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
this	1
name.	1
	1
4:18	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
commanded	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
all	1
nor	1
teach	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
Peter	1
and	1
John	1
answered	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Whether	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
hearken	1
unto	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
unto	1
God,	1
judge	1
ye.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
we	1
cannot	1
but	1
speak	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
4:21	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
further	1
threatened	1
them,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go,	1
finding	1
nothing	1
how	1
they	1
might	1
punish	1
them,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
for	1
all	1
men	1
glorified	1
God	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
	1
4:22	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
above	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
on	1
whom	1
this	1
miracle	1
of	1
healing	1
was	1
shewed.	1
	1
4:23	1
And	1
being	1
let	1
go,	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
company,	1
and	1
reported	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders	1
had	1
said	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
4:24	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voice	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
and	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
thou	1
art	1
God,	1
which	1
hast	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
them	1
is:	1
4:25	1
Who	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
thy	1
servant	1
David	1
hast	1
said,	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
heathen	1
rage,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
imagine	1
vain	1
things?	1
	1
4:26	1
The	1
kings	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
against	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
against	1
his	1
Christ.	1
	1
4:27	1
For	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
against	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
anointed,	1
both	1
Herod,	1
and	1
Pontius	1
Pilate,	1
with	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel,	1
were	1
gathered	1
together,	1
4:28	1
For	1
to	1
do	1
whatsoever	1
thy	1
hand	1
and	1
thy	1
counsel	1
determined	1
before	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
4:29	1
And	1
now,	1
Lord,	1
behold	1
their	1
threatenings:	1
and	1
grant	1
unto	1
thy	1
servants,	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
boldness	1
they	1
may	1
speak	1
thy	1
word,	1
4:30	1
By	1
stretching	1
forth	1
thine	1
hand	1
to	1
heal;	1
and	1
that	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
thy	1
holy	1
child	1
Jesus.	1
	1
4:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
the	1
place	1
was	1
shaken	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
assembled	1
together;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
boldness.	1
	1
4:32	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
were	1
of	1
one	1
heart	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
soul:	1
neither	1
said	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ought	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
possessed	1
was	1
his	1
own;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
things	1
common.	1
	1
4:33	1
And	1
with	1
great	1
power	1
gave	1
the	1
apostles	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus:	1
and	1
great	1
grace	1
was	1
upon	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
4:34	1
Neither	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
lacked:	1
for	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
possessors	1
of	1
lands	1
or	1
houses	1
sold	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
prices	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
sold,	1
4:35	1
And	1
laid	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet:	1
and	1
distribution	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
need.	1
	1
4:36	1
And	1
Joses,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
apostles	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Barnabas,	1
(which	1
is,	1
being	1
interpreted,	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
consolation,)	1
a	1
Levite,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
4:37	1
Having	1
land,	1
sold	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:1	1
But	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias,	1
with	1
Sapphira	1
his	1
wife,	1
sold	1
a	1
possession,	1
5:2	1
And	1
kept	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price,	1
his	1
wife	1
also	1
being	1
privy	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
certain	1
part,	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
apostles'	1
feet.	1
	1
5:3	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Ananias,	1
why	1
hath	1
Satan	1
filled	1
thine	1
heart	1
to	1
lie	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
back	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
5:4	1
Whiles	1
it	1
remained,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
thine	1
own?	1
and	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
sold,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
power?	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
conceived	1
this	1
thing	1
in	1
thine	1
heart?	1
	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
lied	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
5:5	1
And	1
Ananias	1
hearing	1
these	1
words	1
fell	1
down,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:6	1
And	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
arose,	1
wound	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
out,	1
and	1
buried	1
him.	1
	1
5:7	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
hours	1
after,	1
when	1
his	1
wife,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
came	1
in.	1
	1
5:8	1
And	1
Peter	1
answered	1
unto	1
her,	1
Tell	1
me	1
whether	1
ye	1
sold	1
the	1
land	1
for	1
so	1
much?	1
And	1
she	1
said,	1
Yea,	1
for	1
so	1
much.	1
	1
5:9	1
Then	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
agreed	1
together	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
behold,	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
buried	1
thy	1
husband	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
shall	1
carry	1
thee	1
out.	1
	1
5:10	1
Then	1
fell	1
she	1
down	1
straightway	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
yielded	1
up	1
the	1
ghost:	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
her	1
dead,	1
and,	1
carrying	1
her	1
forth,	1
buried	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
great	1
fear	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
upon	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
5:12	1
And	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
were	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
people;	1
(and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
in	1
Solomon's	1
porch.	1
	1
5:13	1
And	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
durst	1
no	1
man	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
them:	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
magnified	1
them.	1
	1
5:14	1
And	1
believers	1
were	1
the	1
more	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
multitudes	1
both	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
women.)	1
	1
5:15	1
Insomuch	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
forth	1
the	1
sick	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
beds	1
and	1
couches,	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
Peter	1
passing	1
by	1
might	1
overshadow	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
5:16	1
There	1
came	1
also	1
a	1
multitude	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
bringing	1
sick	1
folks,	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
vexed	1
with	1
unclean	1
spirits:	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
healed	1
every	1
one.	1
	1
5:17	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
(which	1
is	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Sadducees,)	1
and	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
indignation,	1
5:18	1
And	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
prison.	1
	1
5:19	1
But	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
by	1
night	1
opened	1
the	1
prison	1
doors,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
forth,	1
and	1
said,	1
5:20	1
Go,	1
stand	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
all	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
life.	1
	1
5:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
taught.	1
But	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
council	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
senate	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
prison	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
brought.	1
	1
5:22	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
officers	1
came,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
prison,	1
they	1
returned	1
and	1
told,	1
5:23	1
Saying,	1
The	1
prison	1
truly	1
found	1
we	1
shut	1
with	1
all	1
safety,	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
standing	1
without	1
before	1
the	1
doors:	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
opened,	1
we	1
found	1
no	1
man	1
within.	1
	1
5:24	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
doubted	1
of	1
them	1
whereunto	1
this	1
would	1
grow.	1
	1
5:25	1
Then	1
came	1
one	1
and	1
told	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Behold,	1
the	1
men	1
whom	1
ye	1
put	1
in	1
prison	1
are	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
teaching	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
5:26	1
Then	1
went	1
the	1
captain	1
with	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
without	1
violence:	1
for	1
they	1
feared	1
the	1
people,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
stoned.	1
	1
5:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
brought	1
them,	1
they	1
set	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
council:	1
and	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
asked	1
them,	1
5:28	1
Saying,	1
Did	1
not	1
we	1
straitly	1
command	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
not	1
teach	1
in	1
this	1
name?	1
and,	1
behold,	1
ye	1
have	1
filled	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
your	1
doctrine,	1
and	1
intend	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
man's	1
blood	1
upon	1
us.	1
	1
5:29	1
Then	1
Peter	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
apostles	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
ought	1
to	1
obey	1
God	1
rather	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
5:30	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
ye	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree.	1
	1
5:31	1
Him	1
hath	1
God	1
exalted	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Prince	1
and	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
for	1
to	1
give	1
repentance	1
to	1
Israel,	1
and	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
5:32	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
of	1
these	1
things;	1
and	1
so	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
obey	1
him.	1
	1
5:33	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
that,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
slay	1
them.	1
	1
5:34	1
Then	1
stood	1
there	1
up	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
named	1
Gamaliel,	1
a	1
doctor	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
had	1
in	1
reputation	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
apostles	1
forth	1
a	1
little	1
space;	1
5:35	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
take	1
heed	1
to	1
yourselves	1
what	1
ye	1
intend	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
touching	1
these	1
men.	1
	1
5:36	1
For	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
rose	1
up	1
Theudas,	1
boasting	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
somebody;	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
about	1
four	1
hundred,	1
joined	1
themselves:	1
who	1
was	1
slain;	1
and	1
all,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
scattered,	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
nought.	1
	1
5:37	1
After	1
this	1
man	1
rose	1
up	1
Judas	1
of	1
Galilee	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
the	1
taxing,	1
and	1
drew	1
away	1
much	1
people	1
after	1
him:	1
he	1
also	1
perished;	1
and	1
all,	1
even	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
were	1
dispersed.	1
	1
5:38	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
Refrain	1
from	1
these	1
men,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
alone:	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
counsel	1
or	1
this	1
work	1
be	1
of	1
men,	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
5:39	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
God,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
overthrow	1
it;	1
lest	1
haply	1
ye	1
be	1
found	1
even	1
to	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
5:40	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
agreed:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
beaten	1
them,	1
they	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
5:41	1
And	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
counted	1
worthy	1
to	1
suffer	1
shame	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
5:42	1
And	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
in	1
every	1
house,	1
they	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
teach	1
and	1
preach	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
6:1	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
was	1
multiplied,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
murmuring	1
of	1
the	1
Grecians	1
against	1
the	1
Hebrews,	1
because	1
their	1
widows	1
were	1
neglected	1
in	1
the	1
daily	1
ministration.	1
	1
6:2	1
Then	1
the	1
twelve	1
called	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
reason	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
serve	1
tables.	1
	1
6:3	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
look	1
ye	1
out	1
among	1
you	1
seven	1
men	1
of	1
honest	1
report,	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
appoint	1
over	1
this	1
business.	1
	1
6:4	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
ourselves	1
continually	1
to	1
prayer,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ministry	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
6:5	1
And	1
the	1
saying	1
pleased	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude:	1
and	1
they	1
chose	1
Stephen,	1
a	1
man	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
Philip,	1
and	1
Prochorus,	1
and	1
Nicanor,	1
and	1
Timon,	1
and	1
Parmenas,	1
and	1
Nicolas	1
a	1
proselyte	1
of	1
Antioch:	1
6:6	1
Whom	1
they	1
set	1
before	1
the	1
apostles:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
prayed,	1
they	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them.	1
	1
6:7	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
increased;	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Jerusalem	1
greatly;	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
priests	1
were	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
6:8	1
And	1
Stephen,	1
full	1
of	1
faith	1
and	1
power,	1
did	1
great	1
wonders	1
and	1
miracles	1
among	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
6:9	1
Then	1
there	1
arose	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Libertines,	1
and	1
Cyrenians,	1
and	1
Alexandrians,	1
and	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
disputing	1
with	1
Stephen.	1
	1
6:10	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
spake.	1
	1
6:11	1
Then	1
they	1
suborned	1
men,	1
which	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
Moses,	1
and	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
And	1
they	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
the	1
scribes,	1
and	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
caught	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
council,	1
6:13	1
And	1
set	1
up	1
false	1
witnesses,	1
which	1
said,	1
This	1
man	1
ceaseth	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
blasphemous	1
words	1
against	1
this	1
holy	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
law:	1
6:14	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
him	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
shall	1
destroy	1
this	1
place,	1
and	1
shall	1
change	1
the	1
customs	1
which	1
Moses	1
delivered	1
us.	1
	1
6:15	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
looking	1
stedfastly	1
on	1
him,	1
saw	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
an	1
angel.	1
	1
7:1	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
Are	1
these	1
things	1
so?	1
	1
7:2	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hearken;	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
glory	1
appeared	1
unto	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
Mesopotamia,	1
before	1
he	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran,	1
7:3	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Get	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
country,	1
and	1
from	1
thy	1
kindred,	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
land	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
shew	1
thee.	1
	1
7:4	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldaeans,	1
and	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Charran:	1
and	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
dead,	1
he	1
removed	1
him	1
into	1
this	1
land,	1
wherein	1
ye	1
now	1
dwell.	1
	1
7:5	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
none	1
inheritance	1
in	1
it,	1
no,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on:	1
yet	1
he	1
promised	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
possession,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
seed	1
after	1
him,	1
when	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
child.	1
	1
7:6	1
And	1
God	1
spake	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
That	1
his	1
seed	1
should	1
sojourn	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
land;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
bondage,	1
and	1
entreat	1
them	1
evil	1
four	1
hundred	1
years.	1
	1
7:7	1
And	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
bondage	1
will	1
I	1
judge,	1
said	1
God:	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
shall	1
they	1
come	1
forth,	1
and	1
serve	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
	1
7:8	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
covenant	1
of	1
circumcision:	1
and	1
so	1
Abraham	1
begat	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
the	1
eighth	1
day;	1
and	1
Isaac	1
begat	1
Jacob;	1
and	1
Jacob	1
begat	1
the	1
twelve	1
patriarchs.	1
	1
7:9	1
And	1
the	1
patriarchs,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
sold	1
Joseph	1
into	1
Egypt:	1
but	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
7:10	1
And	1
delivered	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
afflictions,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
favour	1
and	1
wisdom	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Pharaoh	1
king	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
him	1
governor	1
over	1
Egypt	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
7:11	1
Now	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
dearth	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Chanaan,	1
and	1
great	1
affliction:	1
and	1
our	1
fathers	1
found	1
no	1
sustenance.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
when	1
Jacob	1
heard	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
corn	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
he	1
sent	1
out	1
our	1
fathers	1
first.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
Joseph	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
brethren;	1
and	1
Joseph's	1
kindred	1
was	1
made	1
known	1
unto	1
Pharaoh.	1
	1
7:14	1
Then	1
sent	1
Joseph,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
father	1
Jacob	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kindred,	1
threescore	1
and	1
fifteen	1
souls.	1
	1
7:15	1
So	1
Jacob	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
died,	1
he,	1
and	1
our	1
fathers,	1
7:16	1
And	1
were	1
carried	1
over	1
into	1
Sychem,	1
and	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
sepulchre	1
that	1
Abraham	1
bought	1
for	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
Emmor	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Sychem.	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
drew	1
nigh,	1
which	1
God	1
had	1
sworn	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
the	1
people	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
7:18	1
Till	1
another	1
king	1
arose,	1
which	1
knew	1
not	1
Joseph.	1
	1
7:19	1
The	1
same	1
dealt	1
subtilly	1
with	1
our	1
kindred,	1
and	1
evil	1
entreated	1
our	1
fathers,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
cast	1
out	1
their	1
young	1
children,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
live.	1
	1
7:20	1
In	1
which	1
time	1
Moses	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
was	1
exceeding	1
fair,	1
and	1
nourished	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
house	1
three	1
months:	1
7:21	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
cast	1
out,	1
Pharaoh's	1
daughter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
nourished	1
him	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
son.	1
	1
7:22	1
And	1
Moses	1
was	1
learned	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptians,	1
and	1
was	1
mighty	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
in	1
deeds.	1
	1
7:23	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
full	1
forty	1
years	1
old,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
brethren	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
7:24	1
And	1
seeing	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
suffer	1
wrong,	1
he	1
defended	1
him,	1
and	1
avenged	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
oppressed,	1
and	1
smote	1
the	1
Egyptian:	1
7:25	1
For	1
he	1
supposed	1
his	1
brethren	1
would	1
have	1
understood	1
how	1
that	1
God	1
by	1
his	1
hand	1
would	1
deliver	1
them:	1
but	1
they	1
understood	1
not.	1
	1
7:26	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
shewed	1
himself	1
unto	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
strove,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
one	1
again,	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
are	1
brethren;	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
wrong	1
one	1
to	1
another?	1
	1
7:27	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
his	1
neighbour	1
wrong	1
thrust	1
him	1
away,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge	1
over	1
us?	1
7:28	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
kill	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
diddest	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
yesterday?	1
	1
7:29	1
Then	1
fled	1
Moses	1
at	1
this	1
saying,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
stranger	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Madian,	1
where	1
he	1
begat	1
two	1
sons.	1
	1
7:30	1
And	1
when	1
forty	1
years	1
were	1
expired,	1
there	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
mount	1
Sina	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
flame	1
of	1
fire	1
in	1
a	1
bush.	1
	1
7:31	1
When	1
Moses	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
sight:	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
behold	1
it,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
came	1
unto	1
him,	1
7:32	1
Saying,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
thy	1
fathers,	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Isaac,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
Then	1
Moses	1
trembled,	1
and	1
durst	1
not	1
behold.	1
	1
7:33	1
Then	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
him,	1
Put	1
off	1
thy	1
shoes	1
from	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
standest	1
is	1
holy	1
ground.	1
	1
7:34	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
affliction	1
of	1
my	1
people	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
their	1
groaning,	1
and	1
am	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
deliver	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
into	1
Egypt.	1
	1
7:35	1
This	1
Moses	1
whom	1
they	1
refused,	1
saying,	1
Who	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
judge?	1
the	1
same	1
did	1
God	1
send	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
ruler	1
and	1
a	1
deliverer	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
bush.	1
	1
7:36	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
shewed	1
wonders	1
and	1
signs	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Red	1
sea,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
7:37	1
This	1
is	1
that	1
Moses,	1
which	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
A	1
prophet	1
shall	1
the	1
Lord	1
your	1
God	1
raise	1
up	1
unto	1
you	1
of	1
your	1
brethren,	1
like	1
unto	1
me;	1
him	1
shall	1
ye	1
hear.	1
	1
7:38	1
This	1
is	1
he,	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
with	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mount	1
Sina,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
fathers:	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
lively	1
oracles	1
to	1
give	1
unto	1
us:	1
7:39	1
To	1
whom	1
our	1
fathers	1
would	1
not	1
obey,	1
but	1
thrust	1
him	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
turned	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
Egypt,	1
7:40	1
Saying	1
unto	1
Aaron,	1
Make	1
us	1
gods	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
us:	1
for	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
Moses,	1
which	1
brought	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
we	1
wot	1
not	1
what	1
is	1
become	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
7:41	1
And	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
calf	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
offered	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
the	1
idol,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
	1
7:42	1
Then	1
God	1
turned,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
worship	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
heaven;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
O	1
ye	1
house	1
of	1
Israel,	1
have	1
ye	1
offered	1
to	1
me	1
slain	1
beasts	1
and	1
sacrifices	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness?	1
	1
7:43	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
Moloch,	1
and	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
your	1
god	1
Remphan,	1
figures	1
which	1
ye	1
made	1
to	1
worship	1
them:	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
you	1
away	1
beyond	1
Babylon.	1
	1
7:44	1
Our	1
fathers	1
had	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
appointed,	1
speaking	1
unto	1
Moses,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
fashion	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen.	1
	1
7:45	1
Which	1
also	1
our	1
fathers	1
that	1
came	1
after	1
brought	1
in	1
with	1
Jesus	1
into	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whom	1
God	1
drave	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
unto	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
David;	1
7:46	1
Who	1
found	1
favour	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
tabernacle	1
for	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Jacob.	1
	1
7:47	1
But	1
Solomon	1
built	1
him	1
an	1
house.	1
	1
7:48	1
Howbeit	1
the	1
most	1
High	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
as	1
saith	1
the	1
prophet,	1
7:49	1
Heaven	1
is	1
my	1
throne,	1
and	1
earth	1
is	1
my	1
footstool:	1
what	1
house	1
will	1
ye	1
build	1
me?	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord:	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
my	1
rest?	1
	1
7:50	1
Hath	1
not	1
my	1
hand	1
made	1
all	1
these	1
things?	1
	1
7:51	1
Ye	1
stiffnecked	1
and	1
uncircumcised	1
in	1
heart	1
and	1
ears,	1
ye	1
do	1
always	1
resist	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
as	1
your	1
fathers	1
did,	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
7:52	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
have	1
not	1
your	1
fathers	1
persecuted?	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
slain	1
them	1
which	1
shewed	1
before	1
of	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
Just	1
One;	1
of	1
whom	1
ye	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
the	1
betrayers	1
and	1
murderers:	1
7:53	1
Who	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
kept	1
it.	1
	1
7:54	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
they	1
gnashed	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
teeth.	1
	1
7:55	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
looked	1
up	1
stedfastly	1
into	1
heaven,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Jesus	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
7:56	1
And	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
heavens	1
opened,	1
and	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
man	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:57	1
Then	1
they	1
cried	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
and	1
stopped	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
ran	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
7:58	1
And	1
cast	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
stoned	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
witnesses	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
clothes	1
at	1
a	1
young	1
man's	1
feet,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Saul.	1
	1
7:59	1
And	1
they	1
stoned	1
Stephen,	1
calling	1
upon	1
God,	1
and	1
saying,	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
receive	1
my	1
spirit.	1
	1
7:60	1
And	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Lord,	1
lay	1
not	1
this	1
sin	1
to	1
their	1
charge.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
	1
8:1	1
And	1
Saul	1
was	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death.	1
And	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
persecution	1
against	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
throughout	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
except	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
devout	1
men	1
carried	1
Stephen	1
to	1
his	1
burial,	1
and	1
made	1
great	1
lamentation	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
8:3	1
As	1
for	1
Saul,	1
he	1
made	1
havock	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
entering	1
into	1
every	1
house,	1
and	1
haling	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
committed	1
them	1
to	1
prison.	1
	1
8:4	1
Therefore	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
went	1
every	1
where	1
preaching	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
8:5	1
Then	1
Philip	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
preached	1
Christ	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
8:6	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
gave	1
heed	1
unto	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Philip	1
spake,	1
hearing	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
miracles	1
which	1
he	1
did.	1
	1
8:7	1
For	1
unclean	1
spirits,	1
crying	1
with	1
loud	1
voice,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
possessed	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
many	1
taken	1
with	1
palsies,	1
and	1
that	1
were	1
lame,	1
were	1
healed.	1
	1
8:8	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
great	1
joy	1
in	1
that	1
city.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man,	1
called	1
Simon,	1
which	1
beforetime	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
city	1
used	1
sorcery,	1
and	1
bewitched	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Samaria,	1
giving	1
out	1
that	1
himself	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
one:	1
8:10	1
To	1
whom	1
they	1
all	1
gave	1
heed,	1
from	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
greatest,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:11	1
And	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
regard,	1
because	1
that	1
of	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
bewitched	1
them	1
with	1
sorceries.	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
believed	1
Philip	1
preaching	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized,	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
8:13	1
Then	1
Simon	1
himself	1
believed	1
also:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
continued	1
with	1
Philip,	1
and	1
wondered,	1
beholding	1
the	1
miracles	1
and	1
signs	1
which	1
were	1
done.	1
	1
8:14	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
apostles	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
heard	1
that	1
Samaria	1
had	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
them	1
Peter	1
and	1
John:	1
8:15	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
down,	1
prayed	1
for	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost:	1
8:16	1
(For	1
as	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
fallen	1
upon	1
none	1
of	1
them:	1
only	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.)	1
	1
8:17	1
Then	1
laid	1
they	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:18	1
And	1
when	1
Simon	1
saw	1
that	1
through	1
laying	1
on	1
of	1
the	1
apostles'	1
hands	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
was	1
given,	1
he	1
offered	1
them	1
money,	1
8:19	1
Saying,	1
Give	1
me	1
also	1
this	1
power,	1
that	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
lay	1
hands,	1
he	1
may	1
receive	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
8:20	1
But	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
money	1
perish	1
with	1
thee,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
purchased	1
with	1
money.	1
	1
8:21	1
Thou	1
hast	1
neither	1
part	1
nor	1
lot	1
in	1
this	1
matter:	1
for	1
thy	1
heart	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
Repent	1
therefore	1
of	1
this	1
thy	1
wickedness,	1
and	1
pray	1
God,	1
if	1
perhaps	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
thine	1
heart	1
may	1
be	1
forgiven	1
thee.	1
	1
8:23	1
For	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
gall	1
of	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
iniquity.	1
	1
8:24	1
Then	1
answered	1
Simon,	1
and	1
said,	1
Pray	1
ye	1
to	1
the	1
LORD	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
spoken	1
come	1
upon	1
me.	1
	1
8:25	1
And	1
they,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
testified	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
in	1
many	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
Samaritans.	1
	1
8:26	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
spake	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
saying,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
unto	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
goeth	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Gaza,	1
which	1
is	1
desert.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
and	1
went:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Ethiopia,	1
an	1
eunuch	1
of	1
great	1
authority	1
under	1
Candace	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
Ethiopians,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
treasure,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship,	1
8:28	1
Was	1
returning,	1
and	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
chariot	1
read	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
8:29	1
Then	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
Philip,	1
Go	1
near,	1
and	1
join	1
thyself	1
to	1
this	1
chariot.	1
	1
8:30	1
And	1
Philip	1
ran	1
thither	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
read	1
the	1
prophet	1
Esaias,	1
and	1
said,	1
Understandest	1
thou	1
what	1
thou	1
readest?	1
	1
8:31	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
How	1
can	1
I,	1
except	1
some	1
man	1
should	1
guide	1
me?	1
And	1
he	1
desired	1
Philip	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
up	1
and	1
sit	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
8:32	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
scripture	1
which	1
he	1
read	1
was	1
this,	1
He	1
was	1
led	1
as	1
a	1
sheep	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter;	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
lamb	1
dumb	1
before	1
his	1
shearer,	1
so	1
opened	1
he	1
not	1
his	1
mouth:	1
8:33	1
In	1
his	1
humiliation	1
his	1
judgment	1
was	1
taken	1
away:	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
declare	1
his	1
generation?	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
8:34	1
And	1
the	1
eunuch	1
answered	1
Philip,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
of	1
whom	1
speaketh	1
the	1
prophet	1
this?	1
of	1
himself,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
man?	1
	1
8:35	1
Then	1
Philip	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
began	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
scripture,	1
and	1
preached	1
unto	1
him	1
Jesus.	1
	1
8:36	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
way,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
certain	1
water:	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch	1
said,	1
See,	1
here	1
is	1
water;	1
what	1
doth	1
hinder	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
baptized?	1
	1
8:37	1
And	1
Philip	1
said,	1
If	1
thou	1
believest	1
with	1
all	1
thine	1
heart,	1
thou	1
mayest.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:38	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
the	1
chariot	1
to	1
stand	1
still:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
both	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
both	1
Philip	1
and	1
the	1
eunuch;	1
and	1
he	1
baptized	1
him.	1
	1
8:39	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
caught	1
away	1
Philip,	1
that	1
the	1
eunuch	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more:	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
rejoicing.	1
	1
8:40	1
But	1
Philip	1
was	1
found	1
at	1
Azotus:	1
and	1
passing	1
through	1
he	1
preached	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea.	1
	1
9:1	1
And	1
Saul,	1
yet	1
breathing	1
out	1
threatenings	1
and	1
slaughter	1
against	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
went	1
unto	1
the	1
high	1
priest,	1
9:2	1
And	1
desired	1
of	1
him	1
letters	1
to	1
Damascus	1
to	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
way,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
or	1
women,	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:3	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed,	1
he	1
came	1
near	1
Damascus:	1
and	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shined	1
round	1
about	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven:	1
9:4	1
And	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
9:5	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest:	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
9:6	1
And	1
he	1
trembling	1
and	1
astonished	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
what	1
wilt	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
to	1
do?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
must	1
do.	1
	1
9:7	1
And	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
him	1
stood	1
speechless,	1
hearing	1
a	1
voice,	1
but	1
seeing	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
9:8	1
And	1
Saul	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
earth;	1
and	1
when	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened,	1
he	1
saw	1
no	1
man:	1
but	1
they	1
led	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:9	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
three	1
days	1
without	1
sight,	1
and	1
neither	1
did	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
named	1
Ananias;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
said	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
a	1
vision,	1
Ananias.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
here,	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:11	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Straight,	1
and	1
enquire	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Judas	1
for	1
one	1
called	1
Saul,	1
of	1
Tarsus:	1
for,	1
behold,	1
he	1
prayeth,	1
9:12	1
And	1
hath	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
a	1
man	1
named	1
Ananias	1
coming	1
in,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
receive	1
his	1
sight.	1
	1
9:13	1
Then	1
Ananias	1
answered,	1
Lord,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
this	1
man,	1
how	1
much	1
evil	1
he	1
hath	1
done	1
to	1
thy	1
saints	1
at	1
Jerusalem:	1
9:14	1
And	1
here	1
he	1
hath	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
to	1
bind	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
on	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
chosen	1
vessel	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
name	1
before	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
kings,	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:16	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
shew	1
him	1
how	1
great	1
things	1
he	1
must	1
suffer	1
for	1
my	1
name's	1
sake.	1
	1
9:17	1
And	1
Ananias	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
said,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
the	1
Lord,	1
even	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
as	1
thou	1
camest,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
mightest	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight,	1
and	1
be	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
9:18	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
from	1
his	1
eyes	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
scales:	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
sight	1
forthwith,	1
and	1
arose,	1
and	1
was	1
baptized.	1
	1
9:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
meat,	1
he	1
was	1
strengthened.	1
Then	1
was	1
Saul	1
certain	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
disciples	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Damascus.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
straightway	1
he	1
preached	1
Christ	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
9:21	1
But	1
all	1
that	1
heard	1
him	1
were	1
amazed,	1
and	1
said;	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
he	1
that	1
destroyed	1
them	1
which	1
called	1
on	1
this	1
name	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
came	1
hither	1
for	1
that	1
intent,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
bring	1
them	1
bound	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
priests?	1
	1
9:22	1
But	1
Saul	1
increased	1
the	1
more	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
confounded	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Damascus,	1
proving	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
many	1
days	1
were	1
fulfilled,	1
the	1
Jews	1
took	1
counsel	1
to	1
kill	1
him:	1
9:24	1
But	1
their	1
laying	1
await	1
was	1
known	1
of	1
Saul.	1
And	1
they	1
watched	1
the	1
gates	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
9:25	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
night,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
in	1
a	1
basket.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
when	1
Saul	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
he	1
assayed	1
to	1
join	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
disciples:	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
afraid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
believed	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
disciple.	1
	1
9:27	1
But	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
apostles,	1
and	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
Lord	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
preached	1
boldly	1
at	1
Damascus	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus.	1
	1
9:28	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
coming	1
in	1
and	1
going	1
out	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
he	1
spake	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
disputed	1
against	1
the	1
Grecians:	1
but	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
slay	1
him.	1
	1
9:30	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
knew,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
down	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
sent	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
Tarsus.	1
	1
9:31	1
Then	1
had	1
the	1
churches	1
rest	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea	1
and	1
Galilee	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
and	1
were	1
edified;	1
and	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
were	1
multiplied.	1
	1
9:32	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
Peter	1
passed	1
throughout	1
all	1
quarters,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda.	1
	1
9:33	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Aeneas,	1
which	1
had	1
kept	1
his	1
bed	1
eight	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
sick	1
of	1
the	1
palsy.	1
	1
9:34	1
And	1
Peter	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Aeneas,	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
maketh	1
thee	1
whole:	1
arise,	1
and	1
make	1
thy	1
bed.	1
And	1
he	1
arose	1
immediately.	1
	1
9:35	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
dwelt	1
at	1
Lydda	1
and	1
Saron	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:36	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
Joppa	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
named	1
Tabitha,	1
which	1
by	1
interpretation	1
is	1
called	1
Dorcas:	1
this	1
woman	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
good	1
works	1
and	1
almsdeeds	1
which	1
she	1
did.	1
	1
9:37	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
sick,	1
and	1
died:	1
whom	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
washed,	1
they	1
laid	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
upper	1
chamber.	1
	1
9:38	1
And	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
Lydda	1
was	1
nigh	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
the	1
disciples	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Peter	1
was	1
there,	1
they	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
men,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
delay	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
them.	1
	1
9:39	1
Then	1
Peter	1
arose	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
them.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber:	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
widows	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
weeping,	1
and	1
shewing	1
the	1
coats	1
and	1
garments	1
which	1
Dorcas	1
made,	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
9:40	1
But	1
Peter	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
forth,	1
and	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed;	1
and	1
turning	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
said,	1
Tabitha,	1
arise.	1
And	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
eyes:	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Peter,	1
she	1
sat	1
up.	1
	1
9:41	1
And	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
lifted	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
the	1
saints	1
and	1
widows,	1
presented	1
her	1
alive.	1
	1
9:42	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
throughout	1
all	1
Joppa;	1
and	1
many	1
believed	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:43	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
he	1
tarried	1
many	1
days	1
in	1
Joppa	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner.	1
	1
10:1	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
in	1
Caesarea	1
called	1
Cornelius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
the	1
band	1
called	1
the	1
Italian	1
band,	1
10:2	1
A	1
devout	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feared	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
gave	1
much	1
alms	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
prayed	1
to	1
God	1
alway.	1
	1
10:3	1
He	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
vision	1
evidently	1
about	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
God	1
coming	1
in	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
saying	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cornelius.	1
	1
10:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
and	1
said,	1
What	1
is	1
it,	1
Lord?	1
	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thy	1
prayers	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
come	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
10:5	1
And	1
now	1
send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
one	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter:	1
10:6	1
He	1
lodgeth	1
with	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner,	1
whose	1
house	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
he	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
oughtest	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
10:7	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
angel	1
which	1
spake	1
unto	1
Cornelius	1
was	1
departed,	1
he	1
called	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
household	1
servants,	1
and	1
a	1
devout	1
soldier	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
continually;	1
10:8	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
declared	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
them,	1
he	1
sent	1
them	1
to	1
Joppa.	1
	1
10:9	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
drew	1
nigh	1
unto	1
the	1
city,	1
Peter	1
went	1
up	1
upon	1
the	1
housetop	1
to	1
pray	1
about	1
the	1
sixth	1
hour:	1
10:10	1
And	1
he	1
became	1
very	1
hungry,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
eaten:	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
made	1
ready,	1
he	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
trance,	1
10:11	1
And	1
saw	1
heaven	1
opened,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descending	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet	1
knit	1
at	1
the	1
four	1
corners,	1
and	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
earth:	1
10:12	1
Wherein	1
were	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
10:13	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
voice	1
to	1
him,	1
Rise,	1
Peter;	1
kill,	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
10:14	1
But	1
Peter	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
eaten	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
the	1
voice	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
again	1
the	1
second	1
time,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
10:16	1
This	1
was	1
done	1
thrice:	1
and	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
received	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
10:17	1
Now	1
while	1
Peter	1
doubted	1
in	1
himself	1
what	1
this	1
vision	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
should	1
mean,	1
behold,	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
from	1
Cornelius	1
had	1
made	1
enquiry	1
for	1
Simon's	1
house,	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate,	1
10:18	1
And	1
called,	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
Simon,	1
which	1
was	1
surnamed	1
Peter,	1
were	1
lodged	1
there.	1
	1
10:19	1
While	1
Peter	1
thought	1
on	1
the	1
vision,	1
the	1
Spirit	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Behold,	1
three	1
men	1
seek	1
thee.	1
	1
10:20	1
Arise	1
therefore,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
down,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
doubting	1
nothing:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
them.	1
	1
10:21	1
Then	1
Peter	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
sent	1
unto	1
him	1
from	1
Cornelius;	1
and	1
said,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
whom	1
ye	1
seek:	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
ye	1
are	1
come?	1
	1
10:22	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Cornelius	1
the	1
centurion,	1
a	1
just	1
man,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
feareth	1
God,	1
and	1
of	1
good	1
report	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
nation	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
was	1
warned	1
from	1
God	1
by	1
an	1
holy	1
angel	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
thee	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
words	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
10:23	1
Then	1
called	1
he	1
them	1
in,	1
and	1
lodged	1
them.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
Peter	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
from	1
Joppa	1
accompanied	1
him.	1
	1
10:24	1
And	1
the	1
morrow	1
after	1
they	1
entered	1
into	1
Caesarea.	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
waited	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
together	1
his	1
kinsmen	1
and	1
near	1
friends.	1
	1
10:25	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
was	1
coming	1
in,	1
Cornelius	1
met	1
him,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
him.	1
	1
10:26	1
But	1
Peter	1
took	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Stand	1
up;	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
10:27	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
with	1
him,	1
he	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
found	1
many	1
that	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
10:28	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
unlawful	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Jew	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
one	1
of	1
another	1
nation;	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
any	1
man	1
common	1
or	1
unclean.	1
	1
10:29	1
Therefore	1
came	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
without	1
gainsaying,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sent	1
for:	1
I	1
ask	1
therefore	1
for	1
what	1
intent	1
ye	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
me?	1
	1
10:30	1
And	1
Cornelius	1
said,	1
Four	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
fasting	1
until	1
this	1
hour;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
ninth	1
hour	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
man	1
stood	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
bright	1
clothing,	1
10:31	1
And	1
said,	1
Cornelius,	1
thy	1
prayer	1
is	1
heard,	1
and	1
thine	1
alms	1
are	1
had	1
in	1
remembrance	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Send	1
therefore	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
hither	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
he	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
one	1
Simon	1
a	1
tanner	1
by	1
the	1
sea	1
side:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
cometh,	1
shall	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
10:33	1
Immediately	1
therefore	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
thee;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
well	1
done	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
Now	1
therefore	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
here	1
present	1
before	1
God,	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
commanded	1
thee	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:34	1
Then	1
Peter	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
said,	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
no	1
respecter	1
of	1
persons:	1
10:35	1
But	1
in	1
every	1
nation	1
he	1
that	1
feareth	1
him,	1
and	1
worketh	1
righteousness,	1
is	1
accepted	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:36	1
The	1
word	1
which	1
God	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel,	1
preaching	1
peace	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
(he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
all:)	1
10:37	1
That	1
word,	1
I	1
say,	1
ye	1
know,	1
which	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
began	1
from	1
Galilee,	1
after	1
the	1
baptism	1
which	1
John	1
preached;	1
10:38	1
How	1
God	1
anointed	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
with	1
power:	1
who	1
went	1
about	1
doing	1
good,	1
and	1
healing	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
oppressed	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
for	1
God	1
was	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
10:39	1
And	1
we	1
are	1
witnesses	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
in	1
Jerusalem;	1
whom	1
they	1
slew	1
and	1
hanged	1
on	1
a	1
tree:	1
10:40	1
Him	1
God	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
and	1
shewed	1
him	1
openly;	1
10:41	1
Not	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
but	1
unto	1
witnesses	1
chosen	1
before	1
God,	1
even	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
did	1
eat	1
and	1
drink	1
with	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
10:42	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
us	1
to	1
preach	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
testify	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
he	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Judge	1
of	1
quick	1
and	1
dead.	1
	1
10:43	1
To	1
him	1
give	1
all	1
the	1
prophets	1
witness,	1
that	1
through	1
his	1
name	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
receive	1
remission	1
of	1
sins.	1
	1
10:44	1
While	1
Peter	1
yet	1
spake	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
heard	1
the	1
word.	1
	1
10:45	1
And	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
which	1
believed	1
were	1
astonished,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
came	1
with	1
Peter,	1
because	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also	1
was	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
10:46	1
For	1
they	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
magnify	1
God.	1
Then	1
answered	1
Peter,	1
10:47	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
forbid	1
water,	1
that	1
these	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
baptized,	1
which	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we?	1
	1
10:48	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Then	1
prayed	1
they	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
11:1	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
Judaea	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
had	1
also	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:2	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
contended	1
with	1
him,	1
11:3	1
Saying,	1
Thou	1
wentest	1
in	1
to	1
men	1
uncircumcised,	1
and	1
didst	1
eat	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
Peter	1
rehearsed	1
the	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
expounded	1
it	1
by	1
order	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
11:5	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Joppa	1
praying:	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trance	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
vision,	1
A	1
certain	1
vessel	1
descend,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
sheet,	1
let	1
down	1
from	1
heaven	1
by	1
four	1
corners;	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
even	1
to	1
me:	1
11:6	1
Upon	1
the	1
which	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
fastened	1
mine	1
eyes,	1
I	1
considered,	1
and	1
saw	1
fourfooted	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things,	1
and	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
11:7	1
And	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
Peter;	1
slay	1
and	1
eat.	1
	1
11:8	1
But	1
I	1
said,	1
Not	1
so,	1
Lord:	1
for	1
nothing	1
common	1
or	1
unclean	1
hath	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
mouth.	1
	1
11:9	1
But	1
the	1
voice	1
answered	1
me	1
again	1
from	1
heaven,	1
What	1
God	1
hath	1
cleansed,	1
that	1
call	1
not	1
thou	1
common.	1
	1
11:10	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
three	1
times:	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
drawn	1
up	1
again	1
into	1
heaven.	1
	1
11:11	1
And,	1
behold,	1
immediately	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
men	1
already	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
I	1
was,	1
sent	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
11:12	1
And	1
the	1
Spirit	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
with	1
them,	1
nothing	1
doubting.	1
Moreover	1
these	1
six	1
brethren	1
accompanied	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
man's	1
house:	1
11:13	1
And	1
he	1
shewed	1
us	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
an	1
angel	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
which	1
stood	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Send	1
men	1
to	1
Joppa,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
Simon,	1
whose	1
surname	1
is	1
Peter;	1
11:14	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
thee	1
words,	1
whereby	1
thou	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
house	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:15	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
speak,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
fell	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
on	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
beginning.	1
	1
11:16	1
Then	1
remembered	1
I	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
that	1
he	1
said,	1
John	1
indeed	1
baptized	1
with	1
water;	1
but	1
ye	1
shall	1
be	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
11:17	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
like	1
gift	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us,	1
who	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
what	1
was	1
I,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
withstand	1
God?	1
	1
11:18	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
they	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
and	1
glorified	1
God,	1
saying,	1
Then	1
hath	1
God	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
granted	1
repentance	1
unto	1
life.	1
	1
11:19	1
Now	1
they	1
which	1
were	1
scattered	1
abroad	1
upon	1
the	1
persecution	1
that	1
arose	1
about	1
Stephen	1
travelled	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
Cyprus,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
only.	1
	1
11:20	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
men	1
of	1
Cyprus	1
and	1
Cyrene,	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
Grecians,	1
preaching	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus.	1
	1
11:21	1
And	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
with	1
them:	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
believed,	1
and	1
turned	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:22	1
Then	1
tidings	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
they	1
sent	1
forth	1
Barnabas,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:23	1
Who,	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
and	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
was	1
glad,	1
and	1
exhorted	1
them	1
all,	1
that	1
with	1
purpose	1
of	1
heart	1
they	1
would	1
cleave	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
and	1
of	1
faith:	1
and	1
much	1
people	1
was	1
added	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:25	1
Then	1
departed	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Tarsus,	1
for	1
to	1
seek	1
Saul:	1
11:26	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him,	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
a	1
whole	1
year	1
they	1
assembled	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
taught	1
much	1
people.	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
called	1
Christians	1
first	1
in	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:27	1
And	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
came	1
prophets	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
Antioch.	1
	1
11:28	1
And	1
there	1
stood	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
named	1
Agabus,	1
and	1
signified	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
great	1
dearth	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
world:	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Claudius	1
Caesar.	1
	1
11:29	1
Then	1
the	1
disciples,	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ability,	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
relief	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Judaea:	1
11:30	1
Which	1
also	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
elders	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
about	1
that	1
time	1
Herod	1
the	1
king	1
stretched	1
forth	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
vex	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
he	1
killed	1
James	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
John	1
with	1
the	1
sword.	1
	1
12:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
further	1
to	1
take	1
Peter	1
also.	1
(Then	1
were	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread.)	1
	1
12:4	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
apprehended	1
him,	1
he	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
prison,	1
and	1
delivered	1
him	1
to	1
four	1
quaternions	1
of	1
soldiers	1
to	1
keep	1
him;	1
intending	1
after	1
Easter	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
12:5	1
Peter	1
therefore	1
was	1
kept	1
in	1
prison:	1
but	1
prayer	1
was	1
made	1
without	1
ceasing	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
unto	1
God	1
for	1
him.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth,	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
Peter	1
was	1
sleeping	1
between	1
two	1
soldiers,	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains:	1
and	1
the	1
keepers	1
before	1
the	1
door	1
kept	1
the	1
prison.	1
	1
12:7	1
And,	1
behold,	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
came	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
light	1
shined	1
in	1
the	1
prison:	1
and	1
he	1
smote	1
Peter	1
on	1
the	1
side,	1
and	1
raised	1
him	1
up,	1
saying,	1
Arise	1
up	1
quickly.	1
And	1
his	1
chains	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
his	1
hands.	1
	1
12:8	1
And	1
the	1
angel	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Gird	1
thyself,	1
and	1
bind	1
on	1
thy	1
sandals.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
did.	1
And	1
he	1
saith	1
unto	1
him,	1
Cast	1
thy	1
garment	1
about	1
thee,	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
	1
12:9	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
followed	1
him;	1
and	1
wist	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
which	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
angel;	1
but	1
thought	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
vision.	1
	1
12:10	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
ward,	1
they	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
iron	1
gate	1
that	1
leadeth	1
unto	1
the	1
city;	1
which	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord:	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
through	1
one	1
street;	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
angel	1
departed	1
from	1
him.	1
	1
12:11	1
And	1
when	1
Peter	1
was	1
come	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
Now	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
surety,	1
that	1
the	1
LORD	1
hath	1
sent	1
his	1
angel,	1
and	1
hath	1
delivered	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Herod,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
12:12	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
considered	1
the	1
thing,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Mary	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark;	1
where	1
many	1
were	1
gathered	1
together	1
praying.	1
	1
12:13	1
And	1
as	1
Peter	1
knocked	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
a	1
damsel	1
came	1
to	1
hearken,	1
named	1
Rhoda.	1
	1
12:14	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
knew	1
Peter's	1
voice,	1
she	1
opened	1
not	1
the	1
gate	1
for	1
gladness,	1
but	1
ran	1
in,	1
and	1
told	1
how	1
Peter	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
gate.	1
	1
12:15	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
Thou	1
art	1
mad.	1
But	1
she	1
constantly	1
affirmed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
even	1
so.	1
Then	1
said	1
they,	1
It	1
is	1
his	1
angel.	1
	1
12:16	1
But	1
Peter	1
continued	1
knocking:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
saw	1
him,	1
they	1
were	1
astonished.	1
	1
12:17	1
But	1
he,	1
beckoning	1
unto	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
peace,	1
declared	1
unto	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison.	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
Go	1
shew	1
these	1
things	1
unto	1
James,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
brethren.	1
And	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
another	1
place.	1
	1
12:18	1
Now	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
among	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
what	1
was	1
become	1
of	1
Peter.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
when	1
Herod	1
had	1
sought	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
not,	1
he	1
examined	1
the	1
keepers,	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
there	1
abode.	1
	1
12:20	1
And	1
Herod	1
was	1
highly	1
displeased	1
with	1
them	1
of	1
Tyre	1
and	1
Sidon:	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
made	1
Blastus	1
the	1
king's	1
chamberlain	1
their	1
friend,	1
desired	1
peace;	1
because	1
their	1
country	1
was	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
king's	1
country.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
upon	1
a	1
set	1
day	1
Herod,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
royal	1
apparel,	1
sat	1
upon	1
his	1
throne,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
oration	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
12:22	1
And	1
the	1
people	1
gave	1
a	1
shout,	1
saying,	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
a	1
god,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
	1
12:23	1
And	1
immediately	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
smote	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
gave	1
not	1
God	1
the	1
glory:	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eaten	1
of	1
worms,	1
and	1
gave	1
up	1
the	1
ghost.	1
	1
12:24	1
But	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
grew	1
and	1
multiplied.	1
	1
12:25	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
returned	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
their	1
ministry,	1
and	1
took	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
13:1	1
Now	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
Antioch	1
certain	1
prophets	1
and	1
teachers;	1
as	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
Simeon	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Niger,	1
and	1
Lucius	1
of	1
Cyrene,	1
and	1
Manaen,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
with	1
Herod	1
the	1
tetrarch,	1
and	1
Saul.	1
	1
13:2	1
As	1
they	1
ministered	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
fasted,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
said,	1
Separate	1
me	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
whereunto	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
them.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fasted	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
their	1
hands	1
on	1
them,	1
they	1
sent	1
them	1
away.	1
	1
13:4	1
So	1
they,	1
being	1
sent	1
forth	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
departed	1
unto	1
Seleucia;	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
they	1
sailed	1
to	1
Cyprus.	1
	1
13:5	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
Salamis,	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
also	1
John	1
to	1
their	1
minister.	1
	1
13:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
isle	1
unto	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
sorcerer,	1
a	1
false	1
prophet,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Barjesus:	1
13:7	1
Which	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
Sergius	1
Paulus,	1
a	1
prudent	1
man;	1
who	1
called	1
for	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Saul,	1
and	1
desired	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:8	1
But	1
Elymas	1
the	1
sorcerer	1
(for	1
so	1
is	1
his	1
name	1
by	1
interpretation)	1
withstood	1
them,	1
seeking	1
to	1
turn	1
away	1
the	1
deputy	1
from	1
the	1
faith.	1
	1
13:9	1
Then	1
Saul,	1
(who	1
also	1
is	1
called	1
Paul,)	1
filled	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
set	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
him.	1
	1
13:10	1
And	1
said,	1
O	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
subtilty	1
and	1
all	1
mischief,	1
thou	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
thou	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
righteousness,	1
wilt	1
thou	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
right	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
upon	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
blind,	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
sun	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
And	1
immediately	1
there	1
fell	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
mist	1
and	1
a	1
darkness;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
about	1
seeking	1
some	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
	1
13:12	1
Then	1
the	1
deputy,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
was	1
done,	1
believed,	1
being	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
13:13	1
Now	1
when	1
Paul	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
loosed	1
from	1
Paphos,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Perga	1
in	1
Pamphylia:	1
and	1
John	1
departing	1
from	1
them	1
returned	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
Perga,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch	1
in	1
Pisidia,	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
	1
13:15	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue	1
sent	1
unto	1
them,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
if	1
ye	1
have	1
any	1
word	1
of	1
exhortation	1
for	1
the	1
people,	1
say	1
on.	1
	1
13:16	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
beckoning	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
said,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
ye	1
that	1
fear	1
God,	1
give	1
audience.	1
	1
13:17	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
of	1
Israel	1
chose	1
our	1
fathers,	1
and	1
exalted	1
the	1
people	1
when	1
they	1
dwelt	1
as	1
strangers	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
high	1
arm	1
brought	1
he	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
	1
13:18	1
And	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
forty	1
years	1
suffered	1
he	1
their	1
manners	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
13:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
destroyed	1
seven	1
nations	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Chanaan,	1
he	1
divided	1
their	1
land	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
lot.	1
	1
13:20	1
And	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
judges	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years,	1
until	1
Samuel	1
the	1
prophet.	1
	1
13:21	1
And	1
afterward	1
they	1
desired	1
a	1
king:	1
and	1
God	1
gave	1
unto	1
them	1
Saul	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Cis,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin,	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
forty	1
years.	1
	1
13:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
him,	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
unto	1
them	1
David	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
king;	1
to	1
whom	1
also	1
he	1
gave	1
their	1
testimony,	1
and	1
said,	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
David	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
mine	1
own	1
heart,	1
which	1
shall	1
fulfil	1
all	1
my	1
will.	1
	1
13:23	1
Of	1
this	1
man's	1
seed	1
hath	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
promise	1
raised	1
unto	1
Israel	1
a	1
Saviour,	1
Jesus:	1
13:24	1
When	1
John	1
had	1
first	1
preached	1
before	1
his	1
coming	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Israel.	1
	1
13:25	1
And	1
as	1
John	1
fulfilled	1
his	1
course,	1
he	1
said,	1
Whom	1
think	1
ye	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
he.	1
But,	1
behold,	1
there	1
cometh	1
one	1
after	1
me,	1
whose	1
shoes	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
loose.	1
	1
13:26	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
and	1
whosoever	1
among	1
you	1
feareth	1
God,	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
this	1
salvation	1
sent.	1
	1
13:27	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
dwell	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
their	1
rulers,	1
because	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
not,	1
nor	1
yet	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
which	1
are	1
read	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day,	1
they	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
them	1
in	1
condemning	1
him.	1
	1
13:28	1
And	1
though	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
him,	1
yet	1
desired	1
they	1
Pilate	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
slain.	1
	1
13:29	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
fulfilled	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
written	1
of	1
him,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
tree,	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sepulchre.	1
	1
13:30	1
But	1
God	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
13:31	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
many	1
days	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
Galilee	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
who	1
are	1
his	1
witnesses	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
13:32	1
And	1
we	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
glad	1
tidings,	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
promise	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers,	1
13:33	1
God	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
same	1
unto	1
us	1
their	1
children,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
again;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
art	1
my	1
Son,	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
I	1
begotten	1
thee.	1
	1
13:34	1
And	1
as	1
concerning	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
now	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
corruption,	1
he	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
the	1
sure	1
mercies	1
of	1
David.	1
	1
13:35	1
Wherefore	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
another	1
psalm,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
suffer	1
thine	1
Holy	1
One	1
to	1
see	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:36	1
For	1
David,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
served	1
his	1
own	1
generation	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
fell	1
on	1
sleep,	1
and	1
was	1
laid	1
unto	1
his	1
fathers,	1
and	1
saw	1
corruption:	1
13:37	1
But	1
he,	1
whom	1
God	1
raised	1
again,	1
saw	1
no	1
corruption.	1
	1
13:38	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
unto	1
you	1
therefore,	1
men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
that	1
through	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
preached	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins:	1
13:39	1
And	1
by	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
believe	1
are	1
justified	1
from	1
all	1
things,	1
from	1
which	1
ye	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
13:40	1
Beware	1
therefore,	1
lest	1
that	1
come	1
upon	1
you,	1
which	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
prophets;	1
13:41	1
Behold,	1
ye	1
despisers,	1
and	1
wonder,	1
and	1
perish:	1
for	1
I	1
work	1
a	1
work	1
in	1
your	1
days,	1
a	1
work	1
which	1
ye	1
shall	1
in	1
no	1
wise	1
believe,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
declare	1
it	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
13:42	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
were	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
besought	1
that	1
these	1
words	1
might	1
be	1
preached	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath.	1
	1
13:43	1
Now	1
when	1
the	1
congregation	1
was	1
broken	1
up,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
religious	1
proselytes	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas:	1
who,	1
speaking	1
to	1
them,	1
persuaded	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:44	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
sabbath	1
day	1
came	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
together	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:45	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
saw	1
the	1
multitudes,	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
envy,	1
and	1
spake	1
against	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul,	1
contradicting	1
and	1
blaspheming.	1
	1
13:46	1
Then	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
waxed	1
bold,	1
and	1
said,	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
should	1
first	1
have	1
been	1
spoken	1
to	1
you:	1
but	1
seeing	1
ye	1
put	1
it	1
from	1
you,	1
and	1
judge	1
yourselves	1
unworthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life,	1
lo,	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
13:47	1
For	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
commanded	1
us,	1
saying,	1
I	1
have	1
set	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
be	1
for	1
salvation	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
13:48	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
glad,	1
and	1
glorified	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
were	1
ordained	1
to	1
eternal	1
life	1
believed.	1
	1
13:49	1
And	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
was	1
published	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
region.	1
	1
13:50	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
devout	1
and	1
honourable	1
women,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
raised	1
persecution	1
against	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
expelled	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
coasts.	1
	1
13:51	1
But	1
they	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
their	1
feet	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Iconium.	1
	1
13:52	1
And	1
the	1
disciples	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
Iconium,	1
that	1
they	1
went	1
both	1
together	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
so	1
spake,	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks	1
believed.	1
	1
14:2	1
But	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
Jews	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
minds	1
evil	1
affected	1
against	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
14:3	1
Long	1
time	1
therefore	1
abode	1
they	1
speaking	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
which	1
gave	1
testimony	1
unto	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
and	1
granted	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
their	1
hands.	1
	1
14:4	1
But	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
divided:	1
and	1
part	1
held	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
part	1
with	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
14:5	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
assault	1
made	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
with	1
their	1
rulers,	1
to	1
use	1
them	1
despitefully,	1
and	1
to	1
stone	1
them,	1
14:6	1
They	1
were	1
ware	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
fled	1
unto	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Derbe,	1
cities	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
region	1
that	1
lieth	1
round	1
about:	1
14:7	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
14:8	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
at	1
Lystra,	1
impotent	1
in	1
his	1
feet,	1
being	1
a	1
cripple	1
from	1
his	1
mother's	1
womb,	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
walked:	1
14:9	1
The	1
same	1
heard	1
Paul	1
speak:	1
who	1
stedfastly	1
beholding	1
him,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
faith	1
to	1
be	1
healed,	1
14:10	1
Said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Stand	1
upright	1
on	1
thy	1
feet.	1
And	1
he	1
leaped	1
and	1
walked.	1
	1
14:11	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
saw	1
what	1
Paul	1
had	1
done,	1
they	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
Lycaonia,	1
The	1
gods	1
are	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:12	1
And	1
they	1
called	1
Barnabas,	1
Jupiter;	1
and	1
Paul,	1
Mercurius,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
chief	1
speaker.	1
	1
14:13	1
Then	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
which	1
was	1
before	1
their	1
city,	1
brought	1
oxen	1
and	1
garlands	1
unto	1
the	1
gates,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
14:14	1
Which	1
when	1
the	1
apostles,	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
heard	1
of,	1
they	1
rent	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
crying	1
out,	1
14:15	1
And	1
saying,	1
Sirs,	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
these	1
things?	1
We	1
also	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
like	1
passions	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
preach	1
unto	1
you	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
turn	1
from	1
these	1
vanities	1
unto	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
which	1
made	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
therein:	1
14:16	1
Who	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
suffered	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
walk	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
ways.	1
	1
14:17	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
left	1
not	1
himself	1
without	1
witness,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
good,	1
and	1
gave	1
us	1
rain	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fruitful	1
seasons,	1
filling	1
our	1
hearts	1
with	1
food	1
and	1
gladness.	1
	1
14:18	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
sayings	1
scarce	1
restrained	1
they	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
14:19	1
And	1
there	1
came	1
thither	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Iconium,	1
who	1
persuaded	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
having	1
stoned	1
Paul,	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
supposing	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
dead.	1
	1
14:20	1
Howbeit,	1
as	1
the	1
disciples	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
him,	1
he	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
departed	1
with	1
Barnabas	1
to	1
Derbe.	1
	1
14:21	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
had	1
taught	1
many,	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
Lystra,	1
and	1
to	1
Iconium,	1
and	1
Antioch,	1
14:22	1
Confirming	1
the	1
souls	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
exhorting	1
them	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
through	1
much	1
tribulation	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
ordained	1
them	1
elders	1
in	1
every	1
church,	1
and	1
had	1
prayed	1
with	1
fasting,	1
they	1
commended	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
believed.	1
	1
14:24	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
throughout	1
Pisidia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Pamphylia.	1
	1
14:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Perga,	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
Attalia:	1
14:26	1
And	1
thence	1
sailed	1
to	1
Antioch,	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
they	1
fulfilled.	1
	1
14:27	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come,	1
and	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
church	1
together,	1
they	1
rehearsed	1
all	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
faith	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
14:28	1
And	1
there	1
they	1
abode	1
long	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
15:1	1
And	1
certain	1
men	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
taught	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
said,	1
Except	1
ye	1
be	1
circumcised	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
Moses,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
15:2	1
When	1
therefore	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
had	1
no	1
small	1
dissension	1
and	1
disputation	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
determined	1
that	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
of	1
them,	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
about	1
this	1
question.	1
	1
15:3	1
And	1
being	1
brought	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
by	1
the	1
church,	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
Phenice	1
and	1
Samaria,	1
declaring	1
the	1
conversion	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles:	1
and	1
they	1
caused	1
great	1
joy	1
unto	1
all	1
the	1
brethren.	1
	1
15:4	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
they	1
were	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
they	1
declared	1
all	1
things	1
that	1
God	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
15:5	1
But	1
there	1
rose	1
up	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
which	1
believed,	1
saying,	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
needful	1
to	1
circumcise	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
them	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses.	1
	1
15:6	1
And	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
came	1
together	1
for	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
15:7	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
much	1
disputing,	1
Peter	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
ago	1
God	1
made	1
choice	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
my	1
mouth	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
gospel,	1
and	1
believe.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
God,	1
which	1
knoweth	1
the	1
hearts,	1
bare	1
them	1
witness,	1
giving	1
them	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
even	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
unto	1
us;	1
15:9	1
And	1
put	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
them,	1
purifying	1
their	1
hearts	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
15:10	1
Now	1
therefore	1
why	1
tempt	1
ye	1
God,	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
yoke	1
upon	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
disciples,	1
which	1
neither	1
our	1
fathers	1
nor	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
bear?	1
15:11	1
But	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved,	1
even	1
as	1
they.	1
	1
15:12	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
kept	1
silence,	1
and	1
gave	1
audience	1
to	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
declaring	1
what	1
miracles	1
and	1
wonders	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
15:13	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
held	1
their	1
peace,	1
James	1
answered,	1
saying,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
hearken	1
unto	1
me:	1
15:14	1
Simeon	1
hath	1
declared	1
how	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
did	1
visit	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
people	1
for	1
his	1
name.	1
	1
15:15	1
And	1
to	1
this	1
agree	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
prophets;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
15:16	1
After	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
return,	1
and	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
tabernacle	1
of	1
David,	1
which	1
is	1
fallen	1
down;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
build	1
again	1
the	1
ruins	1
thereof,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
it	1
up:	1
15:17	1
That	1
the	1
residue	1
of	1
men	1
might	1
seek	1
after	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
upon	1
whom	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
called,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
doeth	1
all	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
15:18	1
Known	1
unto	1
God	1
are	1
all	1
his	1
works	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
15:19	1
Wherefore	1
my	1
sentence	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
trouble	1
not	1
them,	1
which	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
are	1
turned	1
to	1
God:	1
15:20	1
But	1
that	1
we	1
write	1
unto	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
abstain	1
from	1
pollutions	1
of	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
blood.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
Moses	1
of	1
old	1
time	1
hath	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
him,	1
being	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues	1
every	1
sabbath	1
day.	1
	1
15:22	1
Then	1
pleased	1
it	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
company	1
to	1
Antioch	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Barnabas;	1
namely,	1
Judas	1
surnamed	1
Barsabas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
chief	1
men	1
among	1
the	1
brethren:	1
15:23	1
And	1
they	1
wrote	1
letters	1
by	1
them	1
after	1
this	1
manner;	1
The	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
and	1
brethren	1
send	1
greeting	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
in	1
Antioch	1
and	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia.	1
	1
15:24	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
that	1
certain	1
which	1
went	1
out	1
from	1
us	1
have	1
troubled	1
you	1
with	1
words,	1
subverting	1
your	1
souls,	1
saying,	1
Ye	1
must	1
be	1
circumcised,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
gave	1
no	1
such	1
commandment:	1
15:25	1
It	1
seemed	1
good	1
unto	1
us,	1
being	1
assembled	1
with	1
one	1
accord,	1
to	1
send	1
chosen	1
men	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
our	1
beloved	1
Barnabas	1
and	1
Paul,	1
15:26	1
Men	1
that	1
have	1
hazarded	1
their	1
lives	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:27	1
We	1
have	1
sent	1
therefore	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
who	1
shall	1
also	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
things	1
by	1
mouth.	1
	1
15:28	1
For	1
it	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
and	1
to	1
us,	1
to	1
lay	1
upon	1
you	1
no	1
greater	1
burden	1
than	1
these	1
necessary	1
things;	1
15:29	1
That	1
ye	1
abstain	1
from	1
meats	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
things	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication:	1
from	1
which	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
yourselves,	1
ye	1
shall	1
do	1
well.	1
Fare	1
ye	1
well.	1
	1
15:30	1
So	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
dismissed,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Antioch:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gathered	1
the	1
multitude	1
together,	1
they	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle:	1
15:31	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
for	1
the	1
consolation.	1
	1
15:32	1
And	1
Judas	1
and	1
Silas,	1
being	1
prophets	1
also	1
themselves,	1
exhorted	1
the	1
brethren	1
with	1
many	1
words,	1
and	1
confirmed	1
them.	1
	1
15:33	1
And	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
tarried	1
there	1
a	1
space,	1
they	1
were	1
let	1
go	1
in	1
peace	1
from	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:34	1
Notwithstanding	1
it	1
pleased	1
Silas	1
to	1
abide	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
15:35	1
Paul	1
also	1
and	1
Barnabas	1
continued	1
in	1
Antioch,	1
teaching	1
and	1
preaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
with	1
many	1
others	1
also.	1
	1
15:36	1
And	1
some	1
days	1
after	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
Barnabas,	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
again	1
and	1
visit	1
our	1
brethren	1
in	1
every	1
city	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
preached	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
LORD,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
do.	1
	1
15:37	1
And	1
Barnabas	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
them	1
John,	1
whose	1
surname	1
was	1
Mark.	1
	1
15:38	1
But	1
Paul	1
thought	1
not	1
good	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
who	1
departed	1
from	1
them	1
from	1
Pamphylia,	1
and	1
went	1
not	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
work.	1
	1
15:39	1
And	1
the	1
contention	1
was	1
so	1
sharp	1
between	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
departed	1
asunder	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other:	1
and	1
so	1
Barnabas	1
took	1
Mark,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Cyprus;	1
15:40	1
And	1
Paul	1
chose	1
Silas,	1
and	1
departed,	1
being	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:41	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
through	1
Syria	1
and	1
Cilicia,	1
confirming	1
the	1
churches.	1
	1
16:1	1
Then	1
came	1
he	1
to	1
Derbe	1
and	1
Lystra:	1
and,	1
behold,	1
a	1
certain	1
disciple	1
was	1
there,	1
named	1
Timotheus,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
woman,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
and	1
believed;	1
but	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek:	1
16:2	1
Which	1
was	1
well	1
reported	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
Lystra	1
and	1
Iconium.	1
	1
16:3	1
Him	1
would	1
Paul	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
forth	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
took	1
and	1
circumcised	1
him	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
those	1
quarters:	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
Greek.	1
	1
16:4	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
cities,	1
they	1
delivered	1
them	1
the	1
decrees	1
for	1
to	1
keep,	1
that	1
were	1
ordained	1
of	1
the	1
apostles	1
and	1
elders	1
which	1
were	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
16:5	1
And	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
churches	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
faith,	1
and	1
increased	1
in	1
number	1
daily.	1
	1
16:6	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
throughout	1
Phrygia	1
and	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
and	1
were	1
forbidden	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
word	1
in	1
Asia,	1
16:7	1
After	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Mysia,	1
they	1
assayed	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Bithynia:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
suffered	1
them	1
not.	1
	1
16:8	1
And	1
they	1
passing	1
by	1
Mysia	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
Troas.	1
	1
16:9	1
And	1
a	1
vision	1
appeared	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night;	1
There	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
prayed	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Come	1
over	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
help	1
us.	1
	1
16:10	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
vision,	1
immediately	1
we	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia,	1
assuredly	1
gathering	1
that	1
the	1
Lord	1
had	1
called	1
us	1
for	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
16:11	1
Therefore	1
loosing	1
from	1
Troas,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
to	1
Samothracia,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Neapolis;	1
16:12	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
Philippi,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
city	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
and	1
a	1
colony:	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
abiding	1
certain	1
days.	1
	1
16:13	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
sabbath	1
we	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
by	1
a	1
river	1
side,	1
where	1
prayer	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
we	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
spake	1
unto	1
the	1
women	1
which	1
resorted	1
thither.	1
	1
16:14	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
woman	1
named	1
Lydia,	1
a	1
seller	1
of	1
purple,	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Thyatira,	1
which	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
heard	1
us:	1
whose	1
heart	1
the	1
Lord	1
opened,	1
that	1
she	1
attended	1
unto	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
16:15	1
And	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
baptized,	1
and	1
her	1
household,	1
she	1
besought	1
us,	1
saying,	1
If	1
ye	1
have	1
judged	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
abide	1
there.	1
And	1
she	1
constrained	1
us.	1
	1
16:16	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
as	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
prayer,	1
a	1
certain	1
damsel	1
possessed	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
divination	1
met	1
us,	1
which	1
brought	1
her	1
masters	1
much	1
gain	1
by	1
soothsaying:	1
16:17	1
The	1
same	1
followed	1
Paul	1
and	1
us,	1
and	1
cried,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
high	1
God,	1
which	1
shew	1
unto	1
us	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
salvation.	1
	1
16:18	1
And	1
this	1
did	1
she	1
many	1
days.	1
But	1
Paul,	1
being	1
grieved,	1
turned	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
spirit,	1
I	1
command	1
thee	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
her.	1
	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
hour.	1
	1
16:19	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
masters	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
their	1
gains	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
caught	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
and	1
drew	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
marketplace	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers,	1
16:20	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
magistrates,	1
saying,	1
These	1
men,	1
being	1
Jews,	1
do	1
exceedingly	1
trouble	1
our	1
city,	1
16:21	1
And	1
teach	1
customs,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
receive,	1
neither	1
to	1
observe,	1
being	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:22	1
And	1
the	1
multitude	1
rose	1
up	1
together	1
against	1
them:	1
and	1
the	1
magistrates	1
rent	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
commanded	1
to	1
beat	1
them.	1
	1
16:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
laid	1
many	1
stripes	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
cast	1
them	1
into	1
prison,	1
charging	1
the	1
jailor	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
safely:	1
16:24	1
Who,	1
having	1
received	1
such	1
a	1
charge,	1
thrust	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
prison,	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
feet	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
stocks.	1
	1
16:25	1
And	1
at	1
midnight	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
prayed,	1
and	1
sang	1
praises	1
unto	1
God:	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
heard	1
them.	1
	1
16:26	1
And	1
suddenly	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
earthquake,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
were	1
shaken:	1
and	1
immediately	1
all	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
opened,	1
and	1
every	1
one's	1
bands	1
were	1
loosed.	1
	1
16:27	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
awaking	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
prison	1
doors	1
open,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
himself,	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
prisoners	1
had	1
been	1
fled.	1
	1
16:28	1
But	1
Paul	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
saying,	1
Do	1
thyself	1
no	1
harm:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here.	1
	1
16:29	1
Then	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
a	1
light,	1
and	1
sprang	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
trembling,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
before	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas,	1
16:30	1
And	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
what	1
must	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
saved?	1
	1
16:31	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Believe	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved,	1
and	1
thy	1
house.	1
	1
16:32	1
And	1
they	1
spake	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:33	1
And	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
washed	1
their	1
stripes;	1
and	1
was	1
baptized,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
his,	1
straightway.	1
	1
16:34	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
house,	1
he	1
set	1
meat	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
rejoiced,	1
believing	1
in	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house.	1
	1
16:35	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
the	1
magistrates	1
sent	1
the	1
serjeants,	1
saying,	1
Let	1
those	1
men	1
go.	1
	1
16:36	1
And	1
the	1
keeper	1
of	1
the	1
prison	1
told	1
this	1
saying	1
to	1
Paul,	1
The	1
magistrates	1
have	1
sent	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
go:	1
now	1
therefore	1
depart,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace.	1
	1
16:37	1
But	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
They	1
have	1
beaten	1
us	1
openly	1
uncondemned,	1
being	1
Romans,	1
and	1
have	1
cast	1
us	1
into	1
prison;	1
and	1
now	1
do	1
they	1
thrust	1
us	1
out	1
privily?	1
nay	1
verily;	1
but	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
themselves	1
and	1
fetch	1
us	1
out.	1
	1
16:38	1
And	1
the	1
serjeants	1
told	1
these	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
magistrates:	1
and	1
they	1
feared,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
Romans.	1
	1
16:39	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
and	1
besought	1
them,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
out,	1
and	1
desired	1
them	1
to	1
depart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
	1
16:40	1
And	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prison,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Lydia:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
brethren,	1
they	1
comforted	1
them,	1
and	1
departed.	1
	1
17:1	1
Now	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Amphipolis	1
and	1
Apollonia,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Thessalonica,	1
where	1
was	1
a	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
17:2	1
And	1
Paul,	1
as	1
his	1
manner	1
was,	1
went	1
in	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
three	1
sabbath	1
days	1
reasoned	1
with	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
17:3	1
Opening	1
and	1
alleging,	1
that	1
Christ	1
must	1
needs	1
have	1
suffered,	1
and	1
risen	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
Jesus,	1
whom	1
I	1
preach	1
unto	1
you,	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
17:4	1
And	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
believed,	1
and	1
consorted	1
with	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
devout	1
Greeks	1
a	1
great	1
multitude,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
women	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:5	1
But	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
believed	1
not,	1
moved	1
with	1
envy,	1
took	1
unto	1
them	1
certain	1
lewd	1
fellows	1
of	1
the	1
baser	1
sort,	1
and	1
gathered	1
a	1
company,	1
and	1
set	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
assaulted	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
sought	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
them	1
not,	1
they	1
drew	1
Jason	1
and	1
certain	1
brethren	1
unto	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
crying,	1
These	1
that	1
have	1
turned	1
the	1
world	1
upside	1
down	1
are	1
come	1
hither	1
also;	1
17:7	1
Whom	1
Jason	1
hath	1
received:	1
and	1
these	1
all	1
do	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
Caesar,	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
king,	1
one	1
Jesus.	1
	1
17:8	1
And	1
they	1
troubled	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
things.	1
	1
17:9	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
security	1
of	1
Jason,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
go.	1
	1
17:10	1
And	1
the	1
brethren	1
immediately	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
and	1
Silas	1
by	1
night	1
unto	1
Berea:	1
who	1
coming	1
thither	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
17:11	1
These	1
were	1
more	1
noble	1
than	1
those	1
in	1
Thessalonica,	1
in	1
that	1
they	1
received	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
all	1
readiness	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
searched	1
the	1
scriptures	1
daily,	1
whether	1
those	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
17:12	1
Therefore	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
believed;	1
also	1
of	1
honourable	1
women	1
which	1
were	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
of	1
men,	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
	1
17:13	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
of	1
Thessalonica	1
had	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
was	1
preached	1
of	1
Paul	1
at	1
Berea,	1
they	1
came	1
thither	1
also,	1
and	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
17:14	1
And	1
then	1
immediately	1
the	1
brethren	1
sent	1
away	1
Paul	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
the	1
sea:	1
but	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
abode	1
there	1
still.	1
	1
17:15	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
conducted	1
Paul	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Athens:	1
and	1
receiving	1
a	1
commandment	1
unto	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
for	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
speed,	1
they	1
departed.	1
	1
17:16	1
Now	1
while	1
Paul	1
waited	1
for	1
them	1
at	1
Athens,	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
stirred	1
in	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
city	1
wholly	1
given	1
to	1
idolatry.	1
	1
17:17	1
Therefore	1
disputed	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
with	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
devout	1
persons,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
market	1
daily	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
met	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
17:18	1
Then	1
certain	1
philosophers	1
of	1
the	1
Epicureans,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Stoicks,	1
encountered	1
him.	1
And	1
some	1
said,	1
What	1
will	1
this	1
babbler	1
say?	1
other	1
some,	1
He	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
setter	1
forth	1
of	1
strange	1
gods:	1
because	1
he	1
preached	1
unto	1
them	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
the	1
resurrection.	1
	1
17:19	1
And	1
they	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
unto	1
Areopagus,	1
saying,	1
May	1
we	1
know	1
what	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine,	1
whereof	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
is?	1
	1
17:20	1
For	1
thou	1
bringest	1
certain	1
strange	1
things	1
to	1
our	1
ears:	1
we	1
would	1
know	1
therefore	1
what	1
these	1
things	1
mean.	1
	1
17:21	1
(For	1
all	1
the	1
Athenians	1
and	1
strangers	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
spent	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
nothing	1
else,	1
but	1
either	1
to	1
tell,	1
or	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
new	1
thing.)	1
	1
17:22	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Mars'	1
hill,	1
and	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Athens,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
ye	1
are	1
too	1
superstitious.	1
	1
17:23	1
For	1
as	1
I	1
passed	1
by,	1
and	1
beheld	1
your	1
devotions,	1
I	1
found	1
an	1
altar	1
with	1
this	1
inscription,	1
TO	1
THE	1
UNKNOWN	1
GOD.	1
Whom	1
therefore	1
ye	1
ignorantly	1
worship,	1
him	1
declare	1
I	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
17:24	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
therein,	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
Lord	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth,	1
dwelleth	1
not	1
in	1
temples	1
made	1
with	1
hands;	1
17:25	1
Neither	1
is	1
worshipped	1
with	1
men's	1
hands,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
needed	1
any	1
thing,	1
seeing	1
he	1
giveth	1
to	1
all	1
life,	1
and	1
breath,	1
and	1
all	1
things;	1
17:26	1
And	1
hath	1
made	1
of	1
one	1
blood	1
all	1
nations	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
hath	1
determined	1
the	1
times	1
before	1
appointed,	1
and	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
their	1
habitation;	1
17:27	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
seek	1
the	1
Lord,	1
if	1
haply	1
they	1
might	1
feel	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us:	1
17:28	1
For	1
in	1
him	1
we	1
live,	1
and	1
move,	1
and	1
have	1
our	1
being;	1
as	1
certain	1
also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
poets	1
have	1
said,	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
also	1
his	1
offspring.	1
	1
17:29	1
Forasmuch	1
then	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
God,	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
Godhead	1
is	1
like	1
unto	1
gold,	1
or	1
silver,	1
or	1
stone,	1
graven	1
by	1
art	1
and	1
man's	1
device.	1
	1
17:30	1
And	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
this	1
ignorance	1
God	1
winked	1
at;	1
but	1
now	1
commandeth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
to	1
repent:	1
17:31	1
Because	1
he	1
hath	1
appointed	1
a	1
day,	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
judge	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
righteousness	1
by	1
that	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
ordained;	1
whereof	1
he	1
hath	1
given	1
assurance	1
unto	1
all	1
men,	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
17:32	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
some	1
mocked:	1
and	1
others	1
said,	1
We	1
will	1
hear	1
thee	1
again	1
of	1
this	1
matter.	1
	1
17:33	1
So	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
17:34	1
Howbeit	1
certain	1
men	1
clave	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
believed:	1
among	1
the	1
which	1
was	1
Dionysius	1
the	1
Areopagite,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
named	1
Damaris,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
18:1	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
Paul	1
departed	1
from	1
Athens,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Corinth;	1
18:2	1
And	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Aquila,	1
born	1
in	1
Pontus,	1
lately	1
come	1
from	1
Italy,	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Priscilla;	1
(because	1
that	1
Claudius	1
had	1
commanded	1
all	1
Jews	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
Rome:)	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
18:3	1
And	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
craft,	1
he	1
abode	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
wrought:	1
for	1
by	1
their	1
occupation	1
they	1
were	1
tentmakers.	1
	1
18:4	1
And	1
he	1
reasoned	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue	1
every	1
sabbath,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks.	1
	1
18:5	1
And	1
when	1
Silas	1
and	1
Timotheus	1
were	1
come	1
from	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul	1
was	1
pressed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
18:6	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
opposed	1
themselves,	1
and	1
blasphemed,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
raiment,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Your	1
blood	1
be	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
heads;	1
I	1
am	1
clean;	1
from	1
henceforth	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
18:7	1
And	1
he	1
departed	1
thence,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
certain	1
man's	1
house,	1
named	1
Justus,	1
one	1
that	1
worshipped	1
God,	1
whose	1
house	1
joined	1
hard	1
to	1
the	1
synagogue.	1
	1
18:8	1
And	1
Crispus,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
believed	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
hearing	1
believed,	1
and	1
were	1
baptized.	1
	1
18:9	1
Then	1
spake	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
Paul	1
in	1
the	1
night	1
by	1
a	1
vision,	1
Be	1
not	1
afraid,	1
but	1
speak,	1
and	1
hold	1
not	1
thy	1
peace:	1
18:10	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
shall	1
set	1
on	1
thee	1
to	1
hurt	1
thee:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
city.	1
	1
18:11	1
And	1
he	1
continued	1
there	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
six	1
months,	1
teaching	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
among	1
them.	1
	1
18:12	1
And	1
when	1
Gallio	1
was	1
the	1
deputy	1
of	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
Jews	1
made	1
insurrection	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
18:13	1
Saying,	1
This	1
fellow	1
persuadeth	1
men	1
to	1
worship	1
God	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
18:14	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
was	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
mouth,	1
Gallio	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews,	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
wrong	1
or	1
wicked	1
lewdness,	1
O	1
ye	1
Jews,	1
reason	1
would	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
bear	1
with	1
you:	1
18:15	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
names,	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
law,	1
look	1
ye	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
such	1
matters.	1
	1
18:16	1
And	1
he	1
drave	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
	1
18:17	1
Then	1
all	1
the	1
Greeks	1
took	1
Sosthenes,	1
the	1
chief	1
ruler	1
of	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
beat	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat.	1
And	1
Gallio	1
cared	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
things.	1
	1
18:18	1
And	1
Paul	1
after	1
this	1
tarried	1
there	1
yet	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
sailed	1
thence	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila;	1
having	1
shorn	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
Cenchrea:	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
vow.	1
	1
18:19	1
And	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
there:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
reasoned	1
with	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
18:20	1
When	1
they	1
desired	1
him	1
to	1
tarry	1
longer	1
time	1
with	1
them,	1
he	1
consented	1
not;	1
18:21	1
But	1
bade	1
them	1
farewell,	1
saying,	1
I	1
must	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
keep	1
this	1
feast	1
that	1
cometh	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
again	1
unto	1
you,	1
if	1
God	1
will.	1
And	1
he	1
sailed	1
from	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:22	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
gone	1
up,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
church,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
Antioch.	1
	1
18:23	1
And	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
there,	1
he	1
departed,	1
and	1
went	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
Galatia	1
and	1
Phrygia	1
in	1
order,	1
strengthening	1
all	1
the	1
disciples.	1
	1
18:24	1
And	1
a	1
certain	1
Jew	1
named	1
Apollos,	1
born	1
at	1
Alexandria,	1
an	1
eloquent	1
man,	1
and	1
mighty	1
in	1
the	1
scriptures,	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus.	1
	1
18:25	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
instructed	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
being	1
fervent	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
he	1
spake	1
and	1
taught	1
diligently	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
knowing	1
only	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
John.	1
	1
18:26	1
And	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
boldly	1
in	1
the	1
synagogue:	1
whom	1
when	1
Aquila	1
and	1
Priscilla	1
had	1
heard,	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
unto	1
them,	1
and	1
expounded	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
God	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
18:27	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
disposed	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
Achaia,	1
the	1
brethren	1
wrote,	1
exhorting	1
the	1
disciples	1
to	1
receive	1
him:	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
helped	1
them	1
much	1
which	1
had	1
believed	1
through	1
grace:	1
18:28	1
For	1
he	1
mightily	1
convinced	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
that	1
publickly,	1
shewing	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
that	1
Jesus	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
19:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
while	1
Apollos	1
was	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
Paul	1
having	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
coasts	1
came	1
to	1
Ephesus:	1
and	1
finding	1
certain	1
disciples,	1
19:2	1
He	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Have	1
ye	1
received	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
since	1
ye	1
believed?	1
	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
heard	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
19:3	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Unto	1
what	1
then	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized?	1
And	1
they	1
said,	1
Unto	1
John's	1
baptism.	1
	1
19:4	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
John	1
verily	1
baptized	1
with	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
repentance,	1
saying	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
come	1
after	1
him,	1
that	1
is,	1
on	1
Christ	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:5	1
When	1
they	1
heard	1
this,	1
they	1
were	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
19:6	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
upon	1
them,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
came	1
on	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
prophesied.	1
	1
19:7	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
about	1
twelve.	1
	1
19:8	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
spake	1
boldly	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
months,	1
disputing	1
and	1
persuading	1
the	1
things	1
concerning	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
19:9	1
But	1
when	1
divers	1
were	1
hardened,	1
and	1
believed	1
not,	1
but	1
spake	1
evil	1
of	1
that	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
multitude,	1
he	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
separated	1
the	1
disciples,	1
disputing	1
daily	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
one	1
Tyrannus.	1
	1
19:10	1
And	1
this	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years;	1
so	1
that	1
all	1
they	1
which	1
dwelt	1
in	1
Asia	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks.	1
	1
19:11	1
And	1
God	1
wrought	1
special	1
miracles	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Paul:	1
19:12	1
So	1
that	1
from	1
his	1
body	1
were	1
brought	1
unto	1
the	1
sick	1
handkerchiefs	1
or	1
aprons,	1
and	1
the	1
diseases	1
departed	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
19:13	1
Then	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
vagabond	1
Jews,	1
exorcists,	1
took	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
call	1
over	1
them	1
which	1
had	1
evil	1
spirits	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
LORD	1
Jesus,	1
saying,	1
We	1
adjure	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
Paul	1
preacheth.	1
	1
19:14	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
seven	1
sons	1
of	1
one	1
Sceva,	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
priests,	1
which	1
did	1
so.	1
	1
19:15	1
And	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
answered	1
and	1
said,	1
Jesus	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
Paul	1
I	1
know;	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
ye?	1
	1
19:16	1
And	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
evil	1
spirit	1
was	1
leaped	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
overcame	1
them,	1
and	1
prevailed	1
against	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
fled	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
house	1
naked	1
and	1
wounded.	1
	1
19:17	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks	1
also	1
dwelling	1
at	1
Ephesus;	1
and	1
fear	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
was	1
magnified.	1
	1
19:18	1
And	1
many	1
that	1
believed	1
came,	1
and	1
confessed,	1
and	1
shewed	1
their	1
deeds.	1
	1
19:19	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
which	1
used	1
curious	1
arts	1
brought	1
their	1
books	1
together,	1
and	1
burned	1
them	1
before	1
all	1
men:	1
and	1
they	1
counted	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
silver.	1
	1
19:20	1
So	1
mightily	1
grew	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
prevailed.	1
	1
19:21	1
After	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
ended,	1
Paul	1
purposed	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
saying,	1
After	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there,	1
I	1
must	1
also	1
see	1
Rome.	1
	1
19:22	1
So	1
he	1
sent	1
into	1
Macedonia	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
ministered	1
unto	1
him,	1
Timotheus	1
and	1
Erastus;	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
stayed	1
in	1
Asia	1
for	1
a	1
season.	1
	1
19:23	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
there	1
arose	1
no	1
small	1
stir	1
about	1
that	1
way.	1
	1
19:24	1
For	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
named	1
Demetrius,	1
a	1
silversmith,	1
which	1
made	1
silver	1
shrines	1
for	1
Diana,	1
brought	1
no	1
small	1
gain	1
unto	1
the	1
craftsmen;	1
19:25	1
Whom	1
he	1
called	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
workmen	1
of	1
like	1
occupation,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
craft	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
wealth.	1
	1
19:26	1
Moreover	1
ye	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
that	1
not	1
alone	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
but	1
almost	1
throughout	1
all	1
Asia,	1
this	1
Paul	1
hath	1
persuaded	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
much	1
people,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
no	1
gods,	1
which	1
are	1
made	1
with	1
hands:	1
19:27	1
So	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
our	1
craft	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
at	1
nought;	1
but	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana	1
should	1
be	1
despised,	1
and	1
her	1
magnificence	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
whom	1
all	1
Asia	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
worshippeth.	1
	1
19:28	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
these	1
sayings,	1
they	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
wrath,	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
saying,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:29	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
confusion:	1
and	1
having	1
caught	1
Gaius	1
and	1
Aristarchus,	1
men	1
of	1
Macedonia,	1
Paul's	1
companions	1
in	1
travel,	1
they	1
rushed	1
with	1
one	1
accord	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:30	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
would	1
have	1
entered	1
in	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
disciples	1
suffered	1
him	1
not.	1
	1
19:31	1
And	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
Asia,	1
which	1
were	1
his	1
friends,	1
sent	1
unto	1
him,	1
desiring	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
adventure	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
theatre.	1
	1
19:32	1
Some	1
therefore	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
some	1
another:	1
for	1
the	1
assembly	1
was	1
confused:	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
knew	1
not	1
wherefore	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together.	1
	1
19:33	1
And	1
they	1
drew	1
Alexander	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
multitude,	1
the	1
Jews	1
putting	1
him	1
forward.	1
And	1
Alexander	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
his	1
defence	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
19:34	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Jew,	1
all	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
about	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
cried	1
out,	1
Great	1
is	1
Diana	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians.	1
	1
19:35	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
townclerk	1
had	1
appeased	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
said,	1
Ye	1
men	1
of	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
man	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
knoweth	1
not	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
Ephesians	1
is	1
a	1
worshipper	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
goddess	1
Diana,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
image	1
which	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
Jupiter?	1
	1
19:36	1
Seeing	1
then	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
cannot	1
be	1
spoken	1
against,	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
nothing	1
rashly.	1
	1
19:37	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
brought	1
hither	1
these	1
men,	1
which	1
are	1
neither	1
robbers	1
of	1
churches,	1
nor	1
yet	1
blasphemers	1
of	1
your	1
goddess.	1
	1
19:38	1
Wherefore	1
if	1
Demetrius,	1
and	1
the	1
craftsmen	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
him,	1
have	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
any	1
man,	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
open,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
deputies:	1
let	1
them	1
implead	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
19:39	1
But	1
if	1
ye	1
enquire	1
any	1
thing	1
concerning	1
other	1
matters,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
determined	1
in	1
a	1
lawful	1
assembly.	1
	1
19:40	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
for	1
this	1
day's	1
uproar,	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
cause	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
concourse.	1
	1
19:41	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
dismissed	1
the	1
assembly.	1
	1
20:1	1
And	1
after	1
the	1
uproar	1
was	1
ceased,	1
Paul	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
the	1
disciples,	1
and	1
embraced	1
them,	1
and	1
departed	1
for	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
over	1
those	1
parts,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
much	1
exhortation,	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
Greece,	1
20:3	1
And	1
there	1
abode	1
three	1
months.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
into	1
Syria,	1
he	1
purposed	1
to	1
return	1
through	1
Macedonia.	1
	1
20:4	1
And	1
there	1
accompanied	1
him	1
into	1
Asia	1
Sopater	1
of	1
Berea;	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Thessalonians,	1
Aristarchus	1
and	1
Secundus;	1
and	1
Gaius	1
of	1
Derbe,	1
and	1
Timotheus;	1
and	1
of	1
Asia,	1
Tychicus	1
and	1
Trophimus.	1
	1
20:5	1
These	1
going	1
before	1
tarried	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
Troas.	1
	1
20:6	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
away	1
from	1
Philippi	1
after	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
unleavened	1
bread,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
Troas	1
in	1
five	1
days;	1
where	1
we	1
abode	1
seven	1
days.	1
	1
20:7	1
And	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week,	1
when	1
the	1
disciples	1
came	1
together	1
to	1
break	1
bread,	1
Paul	1
preached	1
unto	1
them,	1
ready	1
to	1
depart	1
on	1
the	1
morrow;	1
and	1
continued	1
his	1
speech	1
until	1
midnight.	1
	1
20:8	1
And	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
lights	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
chamber,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
gathered	1
together.	1
	1
20:9	1
And	1
there	1
sat	1
in	1
a	1
window	1
a	1
certain	1
young	1
man	1
named	1
Eutychus,	1
being	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
sleep:	1
and	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
long	1
preaching,	1
he	1
sunk	1
down	1
with	1
sleep,	1
and	1
fell	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
third	1
loft,	1
and	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
dead.	1
	1
20:10	1
And	1
Paul	1
went	1
down,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
said,	1
Trouble	1
not	1
yourselves;	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
20:11	1
When	1
he	1
therefore	1
was	1
come	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
had	1
broken	1
bread,	1
and	1
eaten,	1
and	1
talked	1
a	1
long	1
while,	1
even	1
till	1
break	1
of	1
day,	1
so	1
he	1
departed.	1
	1
20:12	1
And	1
they	1
brought	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
alive,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
comforted.	1
	1
20:13	1
And	1
we	1
went	1
before	1
to	1
ship,	1
and	1
sailed	1
unto	1
Assos,	1
there	1
intending	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
Paul:	1
for	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
appointed,	1
minding	1
himself	1
to	1
go	1
afoot.	1
	1
20:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
Assos,	1
we	1
took	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Mitylene.	1
	1
20:15	1
And	1
we	1
sailed	1
thence,	1
and	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
over	1
against	1
Chios;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
Samos,	1
and	1
tarried	1
at	1
Trogyllium;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Miletus.	1
	1
20:16	1
For	1
Paul	1
had	1
determined	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
Ephesus,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
Asia:	1
for	1
he	1
hasted,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
Pentecost.	1
	1
20:17	1
And	1
from	1
Miletus	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
Ephesus,	1
and	1
called	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
20:18	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
know,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Asia,	1
after	1
what	1
manner	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
all	1
seasons,	1
20:19	1
Serving	1
the	1
LORD	1
with	1
all	1
humility	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
tears,	1
and	1
temptations,	1
which	1
befell	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
20:20	1
And	1
how	1
I	1
kept	1
back	1
nothing	1
that	1
was	1
profitable	1
unto	1
you,	1
but	1
have	1
shewed	1
you,	1
and	1
have	1
taught	1
you	1
publickly,	1
and	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house,	1
20:21	1
Testifying	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
repentance	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
faith	1
toward	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
20:22	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
go	1
bound	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
not	1
knowing	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
shall	1
befall	1
me	1
there:	1
20:23	1
Save	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
witnesseth	1
in	1
every	1
city,	1
saying	1
that	1
bonds	1
and	1
afflictions	1
abide	1
me.	1
	1
20:24	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
move	1
me,	1
neither	1
count	1
I	1
my	1
life	1
dear	1
unto	1
myself,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
finish	1
my	1
course	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
ministry,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:25	1
And	1
now,	1
behold,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
all,	1
among	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
gone	1
preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
shall	1
see	1
my	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
	1
20:26	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
record	1
this	1
day,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
pure	1
from	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
20:27	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
shunned	1
to	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
counsel	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
20:28	1
Take	1
heed	1
therefore	1
unto	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
flock,	1
over	1
the	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
hath	1
made	1
you	1
overseers,	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
purchased	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
blood.	1
	1
20:29	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
this,	1
that	1
after	1
my	1
departing	1
shall	1
grievous	1
wolves	1
enter	1
in	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
sparing	1
the	1
flock.	1
	1
20:30	1
Also	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
selves	1
shall	1
men	1
arise,	1
speaking	1
perverse	1
things,	1
to	1
draw	1
away	1
disciples	1
after	1
them.	1
	1
20:31	1
Therefore	1
watch,	1
and	1
remember,	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
ceased	1
not	1
to	1
warn	1
every	1
one	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
with	1
tears.	1
	1
20:32	1
And	1
now,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
commend	1
you	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
you	1
up,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
an	1
inheritance	1
among	1
all	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified.	1
	1
20:33	1
I	1
have	1
coveted	1
no	1
man's	1
silver,	1
or	1
gold,	1
or	1
apparel.	1
	1
20:34	1
Yea,	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
know,	1
that	1
these	1
hands	1
have	1
ministered	1
unto	1
my	1
necessities,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
20:35	1
I	1
have	1
shewed	1
you	1
all	1
things,	1
how	1
that	1
so	1
labouring	1
ye	1
ought	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
how	1
he	1
said,	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
blessed	1
to	1
give	1
than	1
to	1
receive.	1
	1
20:36	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
kneeled	1
down,	1
and	1
prayed	1
with	1
them	1
all.	1
	1
20:37	1
And	1
they	1
all	1
wept	1
sore,	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
Paul's	1
neck,	1
and	1
kissed	1
him,	1
20:38	1
Sorrowing	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spake,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
his	1
face	1
no	1
more.	1
And	1
they	1
accompanied	1
him	1
unto	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
21:1	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
we	1
were	1
gotten	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
had	1
launched,	1
we	1
came	1
with	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
unto	1
Coos,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
unto	1
Rhodes,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
unto	1
Patara:	1
21:2	1
And	1
finding	1
a	1
ship	1
sailing	1
over	1
unto	1
Phenicia,	1
we	1
went	1
aboard,	1
and	1
set	1
forth.	1
	1
21:3	1
Now	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
discovered	1
Cyprus,	1
we	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
hand,	1
and	1
sailed	1
into	1
Syria,	1
and	1
landed	1
at	1
Tyre:	1
for	1
there	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
to	1
unlade	1
her	1
burden.	1
	1
21:4	1
And	1
finding	1
disciples,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
seven	1
days:	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
Paul	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
accomplished	1
those	1
days,	1
we	1
departed	1
and	1
went	1
our	1
way;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
brought	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
way,	1
with	1
wives	1
and	1
children,	1
till	1
we	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city:	1
and	1
we	1
kneeled	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
prayed.	1
	1
21:6	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
our	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
another,	1
we	1
took	1
ship;	1
and	1
they	1
returned	1
home	1
again.	1
	1
21:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
finished	1
our	1
course	1
from	1
Tyre,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Ptolemais,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
day.	1
	1
21:8	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
Paul's	1
company	1
departed,	1
and	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea:	1
and	1
we	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Philip	1
the	1
evangelist,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven;	1
and	1
abode	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:9	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
had	1
four	1
daughters,	1
virgins,	1
which	1
did	1
prophesy.	1
	1
21:10	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
there	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Judaea	1
a	1
certain	1
prophet,	1
named	1
Agabus.	1
	1
21:11	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come	1
unto	1
us,	1
he	1
took	1
Paul's	1
girdle,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
and	1
feet,	1
and	1
said,	1
Thus	1
saith	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
So	1
shall	1
the	1
Jews	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
bind	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
owneth	1
this	1
girdle,	1
and	1
shall	1
deliver	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
21:12	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
both	1
we,	1
and	1
they	1
of	1
that	1
place,	1
besought	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:13	1
Then	1
Paul	1
answered,	1
What	1
mean	1
ye	1
to	1
weep	1
and	1
to	1
break	1
mine	1
heart?	1
	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
die	1
at	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
21:14	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
we	1
ceased,	1
saying,	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
be	1
done.	1
	1
21:15	1
And	1
after	1
those	1
days	1
we	1
took	1
up	1
our	1
carriages,	1
and	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
21:16	1
There	1
went	1
with	1
us	1
also	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
disciples	1
of	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
one	1
Mnason	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
an	1
old	1
disciple,	1
with	1
whom	1
we	1
should	1
lodge.	1
	1
21:17	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
come	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
brethren	1
received	1
us	1
gladly.	1
	1
21:18	1
And	1
the	1
day	1
following	1
Paul	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
us	1
unto	1
James;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
elders	1
were	1
present.	1
	1
21:19	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
saluted	1
them,	1
he	1
declared	1
particularly	1
what	1
things	1
God	1
had	1
wrought	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
by	1
his	1
ministry.	1
	1
21:20	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
it,	1
they	1
glorified	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Thou	1
seest,	1
brother,	1
how	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
Jews	1
there	1
are	1
which	1
believe;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
zealous	1
of	1
the	1
law:	1
21:21	1
And	1
they	1
are	1
informed	1
of	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
teachest	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
to	1
forsake	1
Moses,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
circumcise	1
their	1
children,	1
neither	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
the	1
customs.	1
	1
21:22	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
therefore?	1
the	1
multitude	1
must	1
needs	1
come	1
together:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come.	1
	1
21:23	1
Do	1
therefore	1
this	1
that	1
we	1
say	1
to	1
thee:	1
We	1
have	1
four	1
men	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
vow	1
on	1
them;	1
21:24	1
Them	1
take,	1
and	1
purify	1
thyself	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
at	1
charges	1
with	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
shave	1
their	1
heads:	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
those	1
things,	1
whereof	1
they	1
were	1
informed	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
are	1
nothing;	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
also	1
walkest	1
orderly,	1
and	1
keepest	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
21:25	1
As	1
touching	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
which	1
believe,	1
we	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
concluded	1
that	1
they	1
observe	1
no	1
such	1
thing,	1
save	1
only	1
that	1
they	1
keep	1
themselves	1
from	1
things	1
offered	1
to	1
idols,	1
and	1
from	1
blood,	1
and	1
from	1
strangled,	1
and	1
from	1
fornication.	1
	1
21:26	1
Then	1
Paul	1
took	1
the	1
men,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
purifying	1
himself	1
with	1
them	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
purification,	1
until	1
that	1
an	1
offering	1
should	1
be	1
offered	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
21:27	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
seven	1
days	1
were	1
almost	1
ended,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
were	1
of	1
Asia,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
stirred	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
21:28	1
Crying	1
out,	1
Men	1
of	1
Israel,	1
help:	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
man,	1
that	1
teacheth	1
all	1
men	1
every	1
where	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
this	1
place:	1
and	1
further	1
brought	1
Greeks	1
also	1
into	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
hath	1
polluted	1
this	1
holy	1
place.	1
	1
21:29	1
(For	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
before	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
Trophimus	1
an	1
Ephesian,	1
whom	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
temple.)	1
21:30	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
moved,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
ran	1
together:	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
temple:	1
and	1
forthwith	1
the	1
doors	1
were	1
shut.	1
	1
21:31	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
him,	1
tidings	1
came	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
band,	1
that	1
all	1
Jerusalem	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
uproar.	1
	1
21:32	1
Who	1
immediately	1
took	1
soldiers	1
and	1
centurions,	1
and	1
ran	1
down	1
unto	1
them:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
and	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
they	1
left	1
beating	1
of	1
Paul.	1
	1
21:33	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came	1
near,	1
and	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
with	1
two	1
chains;	1
and	1
demanded	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
	1
21:34	1
And	1
some	1
cried	1
one	1
thing,	1
some	1
another,	1
among	1
the	1
multitude:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
certainty	1
for	1
the	1
tumult,	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
21:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
stairs,	1
so	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
borne	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
for	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:36	1
For	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
followed	1
after,	1
crying,	1
Away	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
21:37	1
And	1
as	1
Paul	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
May	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
thee?	1
Who	1
said,	1
Canst	1
thou	1
speak	1
Greek?	1
	1
21:38	1
Art	1
not	1
thou	1
that	1
Egyptian,	1
which	1
before	1
these	1
days	1
madest	1
an	1
uproar,	1
and	1
leddest	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
wilderness	1
four	1
thousand	1
men	1
that	1
were	1
murderers?	1
	1
21:39	1
But	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew	1
of	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
no	1
mean	1
city:	1
and,	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee,	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
	1
21:40	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
licence,	1
Paul	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
beckoned	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
unto	1
the	1
people.	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
silence,	1
he	1
spake	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
saying,	1
22:1	1
Men,	1
brethren,	1
and	1
fathers,	1
hear	1
ye	1
my	1
defence	1
which	1
I	1
make	1
now	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
22:2	1
(And	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
that	1
he	1
spake	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
kept	1
the	1
more	1
silence:	1
and	1
he	1
saith,)	1
22:3	1
I	1
am	1
verily	1
a	1
man	1
which	1
am	1
a	1
Jew,	1
born	1
in	1
Tarsus,	1
a	1
city	1
in	1
Cilicia,	1
yet	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Gamaliel,	1
and	1
taught	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
perfect	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
was	1
zealous	1
toward	1
God,	1
as	1
ye	1
all	1
are	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
22:4	1
And	1
I	1
persecuted	1
this	1
way	1
unto	1
the	1
death,	1
binding	1
and	1
delivering	1
into	1
prisons	1
both	1
men	1
and	1
women.	1
	1
22:5	1
As	1
also	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
doth	1
bear	1
me	1
witness,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
elders:	1
from	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
received	1
letters	1
unto	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
which	1
were	1
there	1
bound	1
unto	1
Jerusalem,	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
punished.	1
	1
22:6	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
was	1
come	1
nigh	1
unto	1
Damascus	1
about	1
noon,	1
suddenly	1
there	1
shone	1
from	1
heaven	1
a	1
great	1
light	1
round	1
about	1
me.	1
	1
22:7	1
And	1
I	1
fell	1
unto	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
	1
22:8	1
And	1
I	1
answered,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth,	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
22:9	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
saw	1
indeed	1
the	1
light,	1
and	1
were	1
afraid;	1
but	1
they	1
heard	1
not	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
spake	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
22:10	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
do,	1
LORD?	1
And	1
the	1
Lord	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Arise,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
Damascus;	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
thee	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
do.	1
	1
22:11	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
that	1
light,	1
being	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
Damascus.	1
	1
22:12	1
And	1
one	1
Ananias,	1
a	1
devout	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
report	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
dwelt	1
there,	1
22:13	1
Came	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
stood,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Brother	1
Saul,	1
receive	1
thy	1
sight.	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
hour	1
I	1
looked	1
up	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
22:14	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
God	1
of	1
our	1
fathers	1
hath	1
chosen	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldest	1
know	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
Just	1
One,	1
and	1
shouldest	1
hear	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
his	1
mouth.	1
	1
22:15	1
For	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
his	1
witness	1
unto	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
and	1
heard.	1
	1
22:16	1
And	1
now	1
why	1
tarriest	1
thou?	1
arise,	1
and	1
be	1
baptized,	1
and	1
wash	1
away	1
thy	1
sins,	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
22:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
come	1
again	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
even	1
while	1
I	1
prayed	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
trance;	1
22:18	1
And	1
saw	1
him	1
saying	1
unto	1
me,	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
get	1
thee	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
Jerusalem:	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
thy	1
testimony	1
concerning	1
me.	1
	1
22:19	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Lord,	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
imprisoned	1
and	1
beat	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue	1
them	1
that	1
believed	1
on	1
thee:	1
22:20	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
thy	1
martyr	1
Stephen	1
was	1
shed,	1
I	1
also	1
was	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
consenting	1
unto	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
raiment	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slew	1
him.	1
	1
22:21	1
And	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
me,	1
Depart:	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
far	1
hence	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
22:22	1
And	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
audience	1
unto	1
this	1
word,	1
and	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices,	1
and	1
said,	1
Away	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
fellow	1
from	1
the	1
earth:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
live.	1
	1
22:23	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
cried	1
out,	1
and	1
cast	1
off	1
their	1
clothes,	1
and	1
threw	1
dust	1
into	1
the	1
air,	1
22:24	1
The	1
chief	1
captain	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
bade	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
scourging;	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
know	1
wherefore	1
they	1
cried	1
so	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
22:25	1
And	1
as	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
with	1
thongs,	1
Paul	1
said	1
unto	1
the	1
centurion	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
Is	1
it	1
lawful	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
scourge	1
a	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
uncondemned?	1
	1
22:26	1
When	1
the	1
centurion	1
heard	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
saying,	1
Take	1
heed	1
what	1
thou	1
doest:	1
for	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
22:27	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
came,	1
and	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
Tell	1
me,	1
art	1
thou	1
a	1
Roman?	1
He	1
said,	1
Yea.	1
	1
22:28	1
And	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
answered,	1
With	1
a	1
great	1
sum	1
obtained	1
I	1
this	1
freedom.	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
But	1
I	1
was	1
free	1
born.	1
	1
22:29	1
Then	1
straightway	1
they	1
departed	1
from	1
him	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
examined	1
him:	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
also	1
was	1
afraid,	1
after	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
bound	1
him.	1
	1
22:30	1
On	1
the	1
morrow,	1
because	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
certainty	1
wherefore	1
he	1
was	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
he	1
loosed	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
bands,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
council	1
to	1
appear,	1
and	1
brought	1
Paul	1
down,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
before	1
them.	1
	1
23:1	1
And	1
Paul,	1
earnestly	1
beholding	1
the	1
council,	1
said,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
lived	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
conscience	1
before	1
God	1
until	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
23:2	1
And	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
Ananias	1
commanded	1
them	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
smite	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
mouth.	1
	1
23:3	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul	1
unto	1
him,	1
God	1
shall	1
smite	1
thee,	1
thou	1
whited	1
wall:	1
for	1
sittest	1
thou	1
to	1
judge	1
me	1
after	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
commandest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
smitten	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
23:4	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
said,	1
Revilest	1
thou	1
God's	1
high	1
priest?	1
	1
23:5	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
wist	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
high	1
priest:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
the	1
ruler	1
of	1
thy	1
people.	1
	1
23:6	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
part	1
were	1
Sadducees,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Pharisees,	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
council,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Pharisee,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
Pharisee:	1
of	1
the	1
hope	1
and	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question.	1
	1
23:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
said,	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
dissension	1
between	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
and	1
the	1
Sadducees:	1
and	1
the	1
multitude	1
was	1
divided.	1
	1
23:8	1
For	1
the	1
Sadducees	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection,	1
neither	1
angel,	1
nor	1
spirit:	1
but	1
the	1
Pharisees	1
confess	1
both.	1
	1
23:9	1
And	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
cry:	1
and	1
the	1
scribes	1
that	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
Pharisees'	1
part	1
arose,	1
and	1
strove,	1
saying,	1
We	1
find	1
no	1
evil	1
in	1
this	1
man:	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
spirit	1
or	1
an	1
angel	1
hath	1
spoken	1
to	1
him,	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
fight	1
against	1
God.	1
	1
23:10	1
And	1
when	1
there	1
arose	1
a	1
great	1
dissension,	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
Paul	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
pulled	1
in	1
pieces	1
of	1
them,	1
commanded	1
the	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
castle.	1
	1
23:11	1
And	1
the	1
night	1
following	1
the	1
Lord	1
stood	1
by	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
Paul:	1
for	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
testified	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
Jerusalem,	1
so	1
must	1
thou	1
bear	1
witness	1
also	1
at	1
Rome.	1
	1
23:12	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
banded	1
together,	1
and	1
bound	1
themselves	1
under	1
a	1
curse,	1
saying	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:13	1
And	1
they	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
this	1
conspiracy.	1
	1
23:14	1
And	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
elders,	1
and	1
said,	1
We	1
have	1
bound	1
ourselves	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
curse,	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
eat	1
nothing	1
until	1
we	1
have	1
slain	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:15	1
Now	1
therefore	1
ye	1
with	1
the	1
council	1
signify	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
that	1
he	1
bring	1
him	1
down	1
unto	1
you	1
to	1
morrow,	1
as	1
though	1
ye	1
would	1
enquire	1
something	1
more	1
perfectly	1
concerning	1
him:	1
and	1
we,	1
or	1
ever	1
he	1
come	1
near,	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
23:16	1
And	1
when	1
Paul's	1
sister's	1
son	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
lying	1
in	1
wait,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
told	1
Paul.	1
	1
23:17	1
Then	1
Paul	1
called	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
centurions	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
Bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
the	1
chief	1
captain:	1
for	1
he	1
hath	1
a	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
tell	1
him.	1
	1
23:18	1
So	1
he	1
took	1
him,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
captain,	1
and	1
said,	1
Paul	1
the	1
prisoner	1
called	1
me	1
unto	1
him,	1
and	1
prayed	1
me	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
unto	1
thee,	1
who	1
hath	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
unto	1
thee.	1
	1
23:19	1
Then	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
with	1
him	1
aside	1
privately,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
What	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
tell	1
me?	1
23:20	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
The	1
Jews	1
have	1
agreed	1
to	1
desire	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
bring	1
down	1
Paul	1
to	1
morrow	1
into	1
the	1
council,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
enquire	1
somewhat	1
of	1
him	1
more	1
perfectly.	1
	1
23:21	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
thou	1
yield	1
unto	1
them:	1
for	1
there	1
lie	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
of	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
forty	1
men,	1
which	1
have	1
bound	1
themselves	1
with	1
an	1
oath,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
drink	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
him:	1
and	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
ready,	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
promise	1
from	1
thee.	1
	1
23:22	1
So	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
then	1
let	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
depart,	1
and	1
charged	1
him,	1
See	1
thou	1
tell	1
no	1
man	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
shewed	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
me.	1
	1
23:23	1
And	1
he	1
called	1
unto	1
him	1
two	1
centurions,	1
saying,	1
Make	1
ready	1
two	1
hundred	1
soldiers	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
horsemen	1
threescore	1
and	1
ten,	1
and	1
spearmen	1
two	1
hundred,	1
at	1
the	1
third	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
night;	1
23:24	1
And	1
provide	1
them	1
beasts,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
set	1
Paul	1
on,	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
safe	1
unto	1
Felix	1
the	1
governor.	1
	1
23:25	1
And	1
he	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
after	1
this	1
manner:	1
23:26	1
Claudius	1
Lysias	1
unto	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
governor	1
Felix	1
sendeth	1
greeting.	1
	1
23:27	1
This	1
man	1
was	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
killed	1
of	1
them:	1
then	1
came	1
I	1
with	1
an	1
army,	1
and	1
rescued	1
him,	1
having	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Roman.	1
	1
23:28	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
cause	1
wherefore	1
they	1
accused	1
him,	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
into	1
their	1
council:	1
23:29	1
Whom	1
I	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
accused	1
of	1
questions	1
of	1
their	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
laid	1
to	1
his	1
charge	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
23:30	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
Jews	1
laid	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
man,	1
I	1
sent	1
straightway	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
gave	1
commandment	1
to	1
his	1
accusers	1
also	1
to	1
say	1
before	1
thee	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
against	1
him.	1
Farewell.	1
	1
23:31	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
commanded	1
them,	1
took	1
Paul,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
by	1
night	1
to	1
Antipatris.	1
	1
23:32	1
On	1
the	1
morrow	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
horsemen	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
castle:	1
23:33	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
Caesarea	1
and	1
delivered	1
the	1
epistle	1
to	1
the	1
governor,	1
presented	1
Paul	1
also	1
before	1
him.	1
	1
23:34	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
he	1
asked	1
of	1
what	1
province	1
he	1
was.	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
understood	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
Cilicia;	1
23:35	1
I	1
will	1
hear	1
thee,	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
thine	1
accusers	1
are	1
also	1
come.	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
Herod's	1
judgment	1
hall.	1
	1
24:1	1
And	1
after	1
five	1
days	1
Ananias	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
descended	1
with	1
the	1
elders,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
orator	1
named	1
Tertullus,	1
who	1
informed	1
the	1
governor	1
against	1
Paul.	1
	1
24:2	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
forth,	1
Tertullus	1
began	1
to	1
accuse	1
him,	1
saying,	1
Seeing	1
that	1
by	1
thee	1
we	1
enjoy	1
great	1
quietness,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
worthy	1
deeds	1
are	1
done	1
unto	1
this	1
nation	1
by	1
thy	1
providence,	1
24:3	1
We	1
accept	1
it	1
always,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
places,	1
most	1
noble	1
Felix,	1
with	1
all	1
thankfulness.	1
	1
24:4	1
Notwithstanding,	1
that	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
further	1
tedious	1
unto	1
thee,	1
I	1
pray	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldest	1
hear	1
us	1
of	1
thy	1
clemency	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
	1
24:5	1
For	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
this	1
man	1
a	1
pestilent	1
fellow,	1
and	1
a	1
mover	1
of	1
sedition	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
Jews	1
throughout	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
a	1
ringleader	1
of	1
the	1
sect	1
of	1
the	1
Nazarenes:	1
24:6	1
Who	1
also	1
hath	1
gone	1
about	1
to	1
profane	1
the	1
temple:	1
whom	1
we	1
took,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
judged	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
law.	1
	1
24:7	1
But	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
Lysias	1
came	1
upon	1
us,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
violence	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
24:8	1
Commanding	1
his	1
accusers	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
thee:	1
by	1
examining	1
of	1
whom	1
thyself	1
mayest	1
take	1
knowledge	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
whereof	1
we	1
accuse	1
him.	1
	1
24:9	1
And	1
the	1
Jews	1
also	1
assented,	1
saying	1
that	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
so.	1
	1
24:10	1
Then	1
Paul,	1
after	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
beckoned	1
unto	1
him	1
to	1
speak,	1
answered,	1
Forasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
of	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
judge	1
unto	1
this	1
nation,	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
more	1
cheerfully	1
answer	1
for	1
myself:	1
24:11	1
Because	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
understand,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
yet	1
but	1
twelve	1
days	1
since	1
I	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem	1
for	1
to	1
worship.	1
	1
24:12	1
And	1
they	1
neither	1
found	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
disputing	1
with	1
any	1
man,	1
neither	1
raising	1
up	1
the	1
people,	1
neither	1
in	1
the	1
synagogues,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
city:	1
24:13	1
Neither	1
can	1
they	1
prove	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
they	1
now	1
accuse	1
me.	1
	1
24:14	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
confess	1
unto	1
thee,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
heresy,	1
so	1
worship	1
I	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
my	1
fathers,	1
believing	1
all	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
prophets:	1
24:15	1
And	1
have	1
hope	1
toward	1
God,	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
also	1
allow,	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
unjust.	1
	1
24:16	1
And	1
herein	1
do	1
I	1
exercise	1
myself,	1
to	1
have	1
always	1
a	1
conscience	1
void	1
to	1
offence	1
toward	1
God,	1
and	1
toward	1
men.	1
	1
24:17	1
Now	1
after	1
many	1
years	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
bring	1
alms	1
to	1
my	1
nation,	1
and	1
offerings.	1
	1
24:18	1
Whereupon	1
certain	1
Jews	1
from	1
Asia	1
found	1
me	1
purified	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
neither	1
with	1
multitude,	1
nor	1
with	1
tumult.	1
	1
24:19	1
Who	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
before	1
thee,	1
and	1
object,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
ought	1
against	1
me.	1
	1
24:20	1
Or	1
else	1
let	1
these	1
same	1
here	1
say,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
found	1
any	1
evil	1
doing	1
in	1
me,	1
while	1
I	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
council,	1
24:21	1
Except	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
voice,	1
that	1
I	1
cried	1
standing	1
among	1
them,	1
Touching	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
by	1
you	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
24:22	1
And	1
when	1
Felix	1
heard	1
these	1
things,	1
having	1
more	1
perfect	1
knowledge	1
of	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
deferred	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
When	1
Lysias	1
the	1
chief	1
captain	1
shall	1
come	1
down,	1
I	1
will	1
know	1
the	1
uttermost	1
of	1
your	1
matter.	1
	1
24:23	1
And	1
he	1
commanded	1
a	1
centurion	1
to	1
keep	1
Paul,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
liberty,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
forbid	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
to	1
minister	1
or	1
come	1
unto	1
him.	1
	1
24:24	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days,	1
when	1
Felix	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
Drusilla,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
Jewess,	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
Paul,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
concerning	1
the	1
faith	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
24:25	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
reasoned	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
temperance,	1
and	1
judgment	1
to	1
come,	1
Felix	1
trembled,	1
and	1
answered,	1
Go	1
thy	1
way	1
for	1
this	1
time;	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
convenient	1
season,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
thee.	1
	1
24:26	1
He	1
hoped	1
also	1
that	1
money	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
given	1
him	1
of	1
Paul,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
loose	1
him:	1
wherefore	1
he	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
oftener,	1
and	1
communed	1
with	1
him.	1
	1
24:27	1
But	1
after	1
two	1
years	1
Porcius	1
Festus	1
came	1
into	1
Felix'	1
room:	1
and	1
Felix,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
left	1
Paul	1
bound.	1
	1
25:1	1
Now	1
when	1
Festus	1
was	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
province,	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
ascended	1
from	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
25:2	1
Then	1
the	1
high	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
him	1
against	1
Paul,	1
and	1
besought	1
him,	1
25:3	1
And	1
desired	1
favour	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
laying	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
kill	1
him.	1
	1
25:4	1
But	1
Festus	1
answered,	1
that	1
Paul	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
at	1
Caesarea,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
depart	1
shortly	1
thither.	1
	1
25:5	1
Let	1
them	1
therefore,	1
said	1
he,	1
which	1
among	1
you	1
are	1
able,	1
go	1
down	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
accuse	1
this	1
man,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wickedness	1
in	1
him.	1
	1
25:6	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
tarried	1
among	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
days,	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
unto	1
Caesarea;	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
commanded	1
Paul	1
to	1
be	1
brought.	1
	1
25:7	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
come,	1
the	1
Jews	1
which	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
stood	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
laid	1
many	1
and	1
grievous	1
complaints	1
against	1
Paul,	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
prove.	1
	1
25:8	1
While	1
he	1
answered	1
for	1
himself,	1
Neither	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
neither	1
against	1
the	1
temple,	1
nor	1
yet	1
against	1
Caesar,	1
have	1
I	1
offended	1
any	1
thing	1
at	1
all.	1
	1
25:9	1
But	1
Festus,	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
pleasure,	1
answered	1
Paul,	1
and	1
said,	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
before	1
me?	1
	1
25:10	1
Then	1
said	1
Paul,	1
I	1
stand	1
at	1
Caesar's	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
where	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
judged:	1
to	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
I	1
done	1
no	1
wrong,	1
as	1
thou	1
very	1
well	1
knowest.	1
	1
25:11	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
an	1
offender,	1
or	1
have	1
committed	1
any	1
thing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
I	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
whereof	1
these	1
accuse	1
me,	1
no	1
man	1
may	1
deliver	1
me	1
unto	1
them.	1
I	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:12	1
Then	1
Festus,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
conferred	1
with	1
the	1
council,	1
answered,	1
Hast	1
thou	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar?	1
unto	1
Caesar	1
shalt	1
thou	1
go.	1
	1
25:13	1
And	1
after	1
certain	1
days	1
king	1
Agrippa	1
and	1
Bernice	1
came	1
unto	1
Caesarea	1
to	1
salute	1
Festus.	1
	1
25:14	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
many	1
days,	1
Festus	1
declared	1
Paul's	1
cause	1
unto	1
the	1
king,	1
saying,	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
man	1
left	1
in	1
bonds	1
by	1
Felix:	1
25:15	1
About	1
whom,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
the	1
chief	1
priests	1
and	1
the	1
elders	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
informed	1
me,	1
desiring	1
to	1
have	1
judgment	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:16	1
To	1
whom	1
I	1
answered,	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
Romans	1
to	1
deliver	1
any	1
man	1
to	1
die,	1
before	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
accused	1
have	1
the	1
accusers	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
and	1
have	1
licence	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
himself	1
concerning	1
the	1
crime	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
25:17	1
Therefore,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
hither,	1
without	1
any	1
delay	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
I	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat,	1
and	1
commanded	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:18	1
Against	1
whom	1
when	1
the	1
accusers	1
stood	1
up,	1
they	1
brought	1
none	1
accusation	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
I	1
supposed:	1
25:19	1
But	1
had	1
certain	1
questions	1
against	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
superstition,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
Jesus,	1
which	1
was	1
dead,	1
whom	1
Paul	1
affirmed	1
to	1
be	1
alive.	1
	1
25:20	1
And	1
because	1
I	1
doubted	1
of	1
such	1
manner	1
of	1
questions,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
there	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
these	1
matters.	1
	1
25:21	1
But	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
appealed	1
to	1
be	1
reserved	1
unto	1
the	1
hearing	1
of	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
till	1
I	1
might	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
Caesar.	1
	1
25:22	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
I	1
would	1
also	1
hear	1
the	1
man	1
myself.	1
To	1
morrow,	1
said	1
he,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hear	1
him.	1
	1
25:23	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
when	1
Agrippa	1
was	1
come,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
with	1
great	1
pomp,	1
and	1
was	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
hearing,	1
with	1
the	1
chief	1
captains,	1
and	1
principal	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
at	1
Festus'	1
commandment	1
Paul	1
was	1
brought	1
forth.	1
	1
25:24	1
And	1
Festus	1
said,	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
and	1
all	1
men	1
which	1
are	1
here	1
present	1
with	1
us,	1
ye	1
see	1
this	1
man,	1
about	1
whom	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
me,	1
both	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
also	1
here,	1
crying	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
live	1
any	1
longer.	1
	1
25:25	1
But	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
hath	1
appealed	1
to	1
Augustus,	1
I	1
have	1
determined	1
to	1
send	1
him.	1
	1
25:26	1
Of	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
unto	1
my	1
lord.	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
forth	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
specially	1
before	1
thee,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
that,	1
after	1
examination	1
had,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
somewhat	1
to	1
write.	1
	1
25:27	1
For	1
it	1
seemeth	1
to	1
me	1
unreasonable	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
prisoner,	1
and	1
not	1
withal	1
to	1
signify	1
the	1
crimes	1
laid	1
against	1
him.	1
	1
26:1	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Thou	1
art	1
permitted	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
thyself.	1
	1
Then	1
Paul	1
stretched	1
forth	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
answered	1
for	1
himself:	1
26:2	1
I	1
think	1
myself	1
happy,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
because	1
I	1
shall	1
answer	1
for	1
myself	1
this	1
day	1
before	1
thee	1
touching	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews:	1
26:3	1
Especially	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
expert	1
in	1
all	1
customs	1
and	1
questions	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
Jews:	1
wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
thee	1
to	1
hear	1
me	1
patiently.	1
	1
26:4	1
My	1
manner	1
of	1
life	1
from	1
my	1
youth,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
among	1
mine	1
own	1
nation	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
know	1
all	1
the	1
Jews;	1
26:5	1
Which	1
knew	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
testify,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
straitest	1
sect	1
of	1
our	1
religion	1
I	1
lived	1
a	1
Pharisee.	1
	1
26:6	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
stand	1
and	1
am	1
judged	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
God,	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers:	1
26:7	1
Unto	1
which	1
promise	1
our	1
twelve	1
tribes,	1
instantly	1
serving	1
God	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
hope	1
to	1
come.	1
For	1
which	1
hope's	1
sake,	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
am	1
accused	1
of	1
the	1
Jews.	1
	1
26:8	1
Why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
thing	1
incredible	1
with	1
you,	1
that	1
God	1
should	1
raise	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
26:9	1
I	1
verily	1
thought	1
with	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
many	1
things	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
of	1
Nazareth.	1
	1
26:10	1
Which	1
thing	1
I	1
also	1
did	1
in	1
Jerusalem:	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
did	1
I	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
prison,	1
having	1
received	1
authority	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
to	1
death,	1
I	1
gave	1
my	1
voice	1
against	1
them.	1
	1
26:11	1
And	1
I	1
punished	1
them	1
oft	1
in	1
every	1
synagogue,	1
and	1
compelled	1
them	1
to	1
blaspheme;	1
and	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
mad	1
against	1
them,	1
I	1
persecuted	1
them	1
even	1
unto	1
strange	1
cities.	1
	1
26:12	1
Whereupon	1
as	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Damascus	1
with	1
authority	1
and	1
commission	1
from	1
the	1
chief	1
priests,	1
26:13	1
At	1
midday,	1
O	1
king,	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
heaven,	1
above	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
shining	1
round	1
about	1
me	1
and	1
them	1
which	1
journeyed	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
26:14	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
I	1
heard	1
a	1
voice	1
speaking	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
saying	1
in	1
the	1
Hebrew	1
tongue,	1
Saul,	1
Saul,	1
why	1
persecutest	1
thou	1
me?	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.	1
	1
26:15	1
And	1
I	1
said,	1
Who	1
art	1
thou,	1
Lord?	1
And	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
Jesus	1
whom	1
thou	1
persecutest.	1
	1
26:16	1
But	1
rise,	1
and	1
stand	1
upon	1
thy	1
feet:	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
appeared	1
unto	1
thee	1
for	1
this	1
purpose,	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
minister	1
and	1
a	1
witness	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
appear	1
unto	1
thee;	1
26:17	1
Delivering	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
unto	1
whom	1
now	1
I	1
send	1
thee,	1
26:18	1
To	1
open	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
from	1
darkness	1
to	1
light,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Satan	1
unto	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
forgiveness	1
of	1
sins,	1
and	1
inheritance	1
among	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
sanctified	1
by	1
faith	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
26:19	1
Whereupon,	1
O	1
king	1
Agrippa,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
disobedient	1
unto	1
the	1
heavenly	1
vision:	1
26:20	1
But	1
shewed	1
first	1
unto	1
them	1
of	1
Damascus,	1
and	1
at	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Judaea,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
repent	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
do	1
works	1
meet	1
for	1
repentance.	1
	1
26:21	1
For	1
these	1
causes	1
the	1
Jews	1
caught	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
temple,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
to	1
kill	1
me.	1
	1
26:22	1
Having	1
therefore	1
obtained	1
help	1
of	1
God,	1
I	1
continue	1
unto	1
this	1
day,	1
witnessing	1
both	1
to	1
small	1
and	1
great,	1
saying	1
none	1
other	1
things	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
prophets	1
and	1
Moses	1
did	1
say	1
should	1
come:	1
26:23	1
That	1
Christ	1
should	1
suffer,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
should	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
should	1
shew	1
light	1
unto	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
26:24	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
thus	1
spake	1
for	1
himself,	1
Festus	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
Paul,	1
thou	1
art	1
beside	1
thyself;	1
much	1
learning	1
doth	1
make	1
thee	1
mad.	1
	1
26:25	1
But	1
he	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mad,	1
most	1
noble	1
Festus;	1
but	1
speak	1
forth	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
soberness.	1
	1
26:26	1
For	1
the	1
king	1
knoweth	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
before	1
whom	1
also	1
I	1
speak	1
freely:	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
are	1
hidden	1
from	1
him;	1
for	1
this	1
thing	1
was	1
not	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
corner.	1
	1
26:27	1
King	1
Agrippa,	1
believest	1
thou	1
the	1
prophets?	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
thou	1
believest.	1
	1
26:28	1
Then	1
Agrippa	1
said	1
unto	1
Paul,	1
Almost	1
thou	1
persuadest	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian.	1
	1
26:29	1
And	1
Paul	1
said,	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
thou,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
that	1
hear	1
me	1
this	1
day,	1
were	1
both	1
almost,	1
and	1
altogether	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
except	1
these	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:30	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
the	1
king	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
Bernice,	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
sat	1
with	1
them:	1
26:31	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
aside,	1
they	1
talked	1
between	1
themselves,	1
saying,	1
This	1
man	1
doeth	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
of	1
bonds.	1
	1
26:32	1
Then	1
said	1
Agrippa	1
unto	1
Festus,	1
This	1
man	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
at	1
liberty,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
appealed	1
unto	1
Caesar.	1
	1
27:1	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
determined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
sail	1
into	1
Italy,	1
they	1
delivered	1
Paul	1
and	1
certain	1
other	1
prisoners	1
unto	1
one	1
named	1
Julius,	1
a	1
centurion	1
of	1
Augustus'	1
band.	1
	1
27:2	1
And	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Adramyttium,	1
we	1
launched,	1
meaning	1
to	1
sail	1
by	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Asia;	1
one	1
Aristarchus,	1
a	1
Macedonian	1
of	1
Thessalonica,	1
being	1
with	1
us.	1
	1
27:3	1
And	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
touched	1
at	1
Sidon.	1
And	1
Julius	1
courteously	1
entreated	1
Paul,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
liberty	1
to	1
go	1
unto	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
refresh	1
himself.	1
	1
27:4	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
launched	1
from	1
thence,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Cyprus,	1
because	1
the	1
winds	1
were	1
contrary.	1
	1
27:5	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
Cilicia	1
and	1
Pamphylia,	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Myra,	1
a	1
city	1
of	1
Lycia.	1
	1
27:6	1
And	1
there	1
the	1
centurion	1
found	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria	1
sailing	1
into	1
Italy;	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
us	1
therein.	1
	1
27:7	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
sailed	1
slowly	1
many	1
days,	1
and	1
scarce	1
were	1
come	1
over	1
against	1
Cnidus,	1
the	1
wind	1
not	1
suffering	1
us,	1
we	1
sailed	1
under	1
Crete,	1
over	1
against	1
Salmone;	1
27:8	1
And,	1
hardly	1
passing	1
it,	1
came	1
unto	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
The	1
fair	1
havens;	1
nigh	1
whereunto	1
was	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Lasea.	1
	1
27:9	1
Now	1
when	1
much	1
time	1
was	1
spent,	1
and	1
when	1
sailing	1
was	1
now	1
dangerous,	1
because	1
the	1
fast	1
was	1
now	1
already	1
past,	1
Paul	1
admonished	1
them,	1
27:10	1
And	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Sirs,	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
voyage	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
hurt	1
and	1
much	1
damage,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
lading	1
and	1
ship,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
our	1
lives.	1
	1
27:11	1
Nevertheless	1
the	1
centurion	1
believed	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
more	1
than	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken	1
by	1
Paul.	1
	1
27:12	1
And	1
because	1
the	1
haven	1
was	1
not	1
commodious	1
to	1
winter	1
in,	1
the	1
more	1
part	1
advised	1
to	1
depart	1
thence	1
also,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
attain	1
to	1
Phenice,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
winter;	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
haven	1
of	1
Crete,	1
and	1
lieth	1
toward	1
the	1
south	1
west	1
and	1
north	1
west.	1
	1
27:13	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew	1
softly,	1
supposing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
obtained	1
their	1
purpose,	1
loosing	1
thence,	1
they	1
sailed	1
close	1
by	1
Crete.	1
	1
27:14	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
after	1
there	1
arose	1
against	1
it	1
a	1
tempestuous	1
wind,	1
called	1
Euroclydon.	1
	1
27:15	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
ship	1
was	1
caught,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
wind,	1
we	1
let	1
her	1
drive.	1
	1
27:16	1
And	1
running	1
under	1
a	1
certain	1
island	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
Clauda,	1
we	1
had	1
much	1
work	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
boat:	1
27:17	1
Which	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up,	1
they	1
used	1
helps,	1
undergirding	1
the	1
ship;	1
and,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
quicksands,	1
strake	1
sail,	1
and	1
so	1
were	1
driven.	1
	1
27:18	1
And	1
we	1
being	1
exceedingly	1
tossed	1
with	1
a	1
tempest,	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship;	1
27:19	1
And	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
we	1
cast	1
out	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands	1
the	1
tackling	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:20	1
And	1
when	1
neither	1
sun	1
nor	1
stars	1
in	1
many	1
days	1
appeared,	1
and	1
no	1
small	1
tempest	1
lay	1
on	1
us,	1
all	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
saved	1
was	1
then	1
taken	1
away.	1
	1
27:21	1
But	1
after	1
long	1
abstinence	1
Paul	1
stood	1
forth	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
said,	1
Sirs,	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
hearkened	1
unto	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
loosed	1
from	1
Crete,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
gained	1
this	1
harm	1
and	1
loss.	1
	1
27:22	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
exhort	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
loss	1
of	1
any	1
man's	1
life	1
among	1
you,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:23	1
For	1
there	1
stood	1
by	1
me	1
this	1
night	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
God,	1
whose	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
serve,	1
27:24	1
Saying,	1
Fear	1
not,	1
Paul;	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
Caesar:	1
and,	1
lo,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
thee	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
sail	1
with	1
thee.	1
	1
27:25	1
Wherefore,	1
sirs,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer:	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
God,	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
even	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me.	1
	1
27:26	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
cast	1
upon	1
a	1
certain	1
island.	1
	1
27:27	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
night	1
was	1
come,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
driven	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
Adria,	1
about	1
midnight	1
the	1
shipmen	1
deemed	1
that	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
some	1
country;	1
27:28	1
And	1
sounded,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
twenty	1
fathoms:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
further,	1
they	1
sounded	1
again,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
fifteen	1
fathoms.	1
	1
27:29	1
Then	1
fearing	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
upon	1
rocks,	1
they	1
cast	1
four	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stern,	1
and	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
day.	1
	1
27:30	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
shipmen	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
flee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ship,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
boat	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
under	1
colour	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
cast	1
anchors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
foreship,	1
27:31	1
Paul	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
centurion	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
Except	1
these	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
ship,	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
27:32	1
Then	1
the	1
soldiers	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
fall	1
off.	1
	1
27:33	1
And	1
while	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
coming	1
on,	1
Paul	1
besought	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
take	1
meat,	1
saying,	1
This	1
day	1
is	1
the	1
fourteenth	1
day	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
tarried	1
and	1
continued	1
fasting,	1
having	1
taken	1
nothing.	1
	1
27:34	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
pray	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
meat:	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
health:	1
for	1
there	1
shall	1
not	1
an	1
hair	1
fall	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
27:35	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thus	1
spoken,	1
he	1
took	1
bread,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
presence	1
of	1
them	1
all:	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
it,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
27:36	1
Then	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
and	1
they	1
also	1
took	1
some	1
meat.	1
	1
27:37	1
And	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
two	1
hundred	1
threescore	1
and	1
sixteen	1
souls.	1
	1
27:38	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
enough,	1
they	1
lightened	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
cast	1
out	1
the	1
wheat	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
	1
27:39	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
day,	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
land:	1
but	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
certain	1
creek	1
with	1
a	1
shore,	1
into	1
the	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
minded,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,	1
to	1
thrust	1
in	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
27:40	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
anchors,	1
they	1
committed	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
loosed	1
the	1
rudder	1
bands,	1
and	1
hoised	1
up	1
the	1
mainsail	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
made	1
toward	1
shore.	1
	1
27:41	1
And	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
two	1
seas	1
met,	1
they	1
ran	1
the	1
ship	1
aground;	1
and	1
the	1
forepart	1
stuck	1
fast,	1
and	1
remained	1
unmoveable,	1
but	1
the	1
hinder	1
part	1
was	1
broken	1
with	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
waves.	1
	1
27:42	1
And	1
the	1
soldiers'	1
counsel	1
was	1
to	1
kill	1
the	1
prisoners,	1
lest	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
swim	1
out,	1
and	1
escape.	1
	1
27:43	1
But	1
the	1
centurion,	1
willing	1
to	1
save	1
Paul,	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
purpose;	1
and	1
commanded	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
could	1
swim	1
should	1
cast	1
themselves	1
first	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
land:	1
27:44	1
And	1
the	1
rest,	1
some	1
on	1
boards,	1
and	1
some	1
on	1
broken	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
ship.	1
	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
they	1
escaped	1
all	1
safe	1
to	1
land.	1
	1
28:1	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
escaped,	1
then	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
was	1
called	1
Melita.	1
	1
28:2	1
And	1
the	1
barbarous	1
people	1
shewed	1
us	1
no	1
little	1
kindness:	1
for	1
they	1
kindled	1
a	1
fire,	1
and	1
received	1
us	1
every	1
one,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
rain,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
cold.	1
	1
28:3	1
And	1
when	1
Paul	1
had	1
gathered	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
sticks,	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
fire,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
viper	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
heat,	1
and	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
	1
28:4	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
barbarians	1
saw	1
the	1
venomous	1
beast	1
hang	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
they	1
said	1
among	1
themselves,	1
No	1
doubt	1
this	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
murderer,	1
whom,	1
though	1
he	1
hath	1
escaped	1
the	1
sea,	1
yet	1
vengeance	1
suffereth	1
not	1
to	1
live.	1
	1
28:5	1
And	1
he	1
shook	1
off	1
the	1
beast	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
felt	1
no	1
harm.	1
	1
28:6	1
Howbeit	1
they	1
looked	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
swollen,	1
or	1
fallen	1
down	1
dead	1
suddenly:	1
but	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
looked	1
a	1
great	1
while,	1
and	1
saw	1
no	1
harm	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
minds,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
god.	1
	1
28:7	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
quarters	1
were	1
possessions	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Publius;	1
who	1
received	1
us,	1
and	1
lodged	1
us	1
three	1
days	1
courteously.	1
	1
28:8	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Publius	1
lay	1
sick	1
of	1
a	1
fever	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
bloody	1
flux:	1
to	1
whom	1
Paul	1
entered	1
in,	1
and	1
prayed,	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
healed	1
him.	1
	1
28:9	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
was	1
done,	1
others	1
also,	1
which	1
had	1
diseases	1
in	1
the	1
island,	1
came,	1
and	1
were	1
healed:	1
28:10	1
Who	1
also	1
honoured	1
us	1
with	1
many	1
honours;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
departed,	1
they	1
laded	1
us	1
with	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
necessary.	1
	1
28:11	1
And	1
after	1
three	1
months	1
we	1
departed	1
in	1
a	1
ship	1
of	1
Alexandria,	1
which	1
had	1
wintered	1
in	1
the	1
isle,	1
whose	1
sign	1
was	1
Castor	1
and	1
Pollux.	1
	1
28:12	1
And	1
landing	1
at	1
Syracuse,	1
we	1
tarried	1
there	1
three	1
days.	1
	1
28:13	1
And	1
from	1
thence	1
we	1
fetched	1
a	1
compass,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
Rhegium:	1
and	1
after	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
south	1
wind	1
blew,	1
and	1
we	1
came	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
to	1
Puteoli:	1
28:14	1
Where	1
we	1
found	1
brethren,	1
and	1
were	1
desired	1
to	1
tarry	1
with	1
them	1
seven	1
days:	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
went	1
toward	1
Rome.	1
	1
28:15	1
And	1
from	1
thence,	1
when	1
the	1
brethren	1
heard	1
of	1
us,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Appii	1
forum,	1
and	1
The	1
three	1
taverns:	1
whom	1
when	1
Paul	1
saw,	1
he	1
thanked	1
God,	1
and	1
took	1
courage.	1
	1
28:16	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
Rome,	1
the	1
centurion	1
delivered	1
the	1
prisoners	1
to	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
the	1
guard:	1
but	1
Paul	1
was	1
suffered	1
to	1
dwell	1
by	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
soldier	1
that	1
kept	1
him.	1
	1
28:17	1
And	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
after	1
three	1
days	1
Paul	1
called	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
together:	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
come	1
together,	1
he	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Men	1
and	1
brethren,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
committed	1
nothing	1
against	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
customs	1
of	1
our	1
fathers,	1
yet	1
was	1
I	1
delivered	1
prisoner	1
from	1
Jerusalem	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Romans.	1
	1
28:18	1
Who,	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
examined	1
me,	1
would	1
have	1
let	1
me	1
go,	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
28:19	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
Jews	1
spake	1
against	1
it,	1
I	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
appeal	1
unto	1
Caesar;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ought	1
to	1
accuse	1
my	1
nation	1
of.	1
	1
28:20	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
therefore	1
have	1
I	1
called	1
for	1
you,	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you:	1
because	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Israel	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
with	1
this	1
chain.	1
	1
28:21	1
And	1
they	1
said	1
unto	1
him,	1
We	1
neither	1
received	1
letters	1
out	1
of	1
Judaea	1
concerning	1
thee,	1
neither	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
brethren	1
that	1
came	1
shewed	1
or	1
spake	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
thee.	1
	1
28:22	1
But	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
thinkest:	1
for	1
as	1
concerning	1
this	1
sect,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
spoken	1
against.	1
	1
28:23	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
appointed	1
him	1
a	1
day,	1
there	1
came	1
many	1
to	1
him	1
into	1
his	1
lodging;	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
expounded	1
and	1
testified	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
persuading	1
them	1
concerning	1
Jesus,	1
both	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
evening.	1
	1
28:24	1
And	1
some	1
believed	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
were	1
spoken,	1
and	1
some	1
believed	1
not.	1
	1
28:25	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
agreed	1
not	1
among	1
themselves,	1
they	1
departed,	1
after	1
that	1
Paul	1
had	1
spoken	1
one	1
word,	1
Well	1
spake	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
by	1
Esaias	1
the	1
prophet	1
unto	1
our	1
fathers,	1
28:26	1
Saying,	1
Go	1
unto	1
this	1
people,	1
and	1
say,	1
Hearing	1
ye	1
shall	1
hear,	1
and	1
shall	1
not	1
understand;	1
and	1
seeing	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
and	1
not	1
perceive:	1
28:27	1
For	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
people	1
is	1
waxed	1
gross,	1
and	1
their	1
ears	1
are	1
dull	1
of	1
hearing,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
have	1
they	1
closed;	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
see	1
with	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
hear	1
with	1
their	1
ears,	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
their	1
heart,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
converted,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
heal	1
them.	1
	1
28:28	1
Be	1
it	1
known	1
therefore	1
unto	1
you,	1
that	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
sent	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
hear	1
it.	1
	1
28:29	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
Jews	1
departed,	1
and	1
had	1
great	1
reasoning	1
among	1
themselves.	1
	1
28:30	1
And	1
Paul	1
dwelt	1
two	1
whole	1
years	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
hired	1
house,	1
and	1
received	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
unto	1
him,	1
28:31	1
Preaching	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
teaching	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
with	1
all	1
confidence,	1
no	1
man	1
forbidding	1
him.	1

	1
The	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Romans	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle,	1
separated	1
unto	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
1:2	1
(Which	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
afore	1
by	1
his	1
prophets	1
in	1
the	1
holy	1
scriptures,)	1
1:3	1
Concerning	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
David	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh;	1
1:4	1
And	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Son	1
of	1
God	1
with	1
power,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
holiness,	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
from	1
the	1
dead:	1
1:5	1
By	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
received	1
grace	1
and	1
apostleship,	1
for	1
obedience	1
to	1
the	1
faith	1
among	1
all	1
nations,	1
for	1
his	1
name:	1
1:6	1
Among	1
whom	1
are	1
ye	1
also	1
the	1
called	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:7	1
To	1
all	1
that	1
be	1
in	1
Rome,	1
beloved	1
of	1
God,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints:	1
Grace	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
peace	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:8	1
First,	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
you	1
all,	1
that	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
spoken	1
of	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
	1
1:9	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
my	1
witness,	1
whom	1
I	1
serve	1
with	1
my	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
without	1
ceasing	1
I	1
make	1
mention	1
of	1
you	1
always	1
in	1
my	1
prayers;	1
1:10	1
Making	1
request,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
now	1
at	1
length	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
prosperous	1
journey	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
impart	1
unto	1
you	1
some	1
spiritual	1
gift,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
established;	1
1:12	1
That	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
comforted	1
together	1
with	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
faith	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
me.	1
	1
1:13	1
Now	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
oftentimes	1
I	1
purposed	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
(but	1
was	1
let	1
hitherto,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
some	1
fruit	1
among	1
you	1
also,	1
even	1
as	1
among	1
other	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
am	1
debtor	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Barbarians;	1
both	1
to	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unwise.	1
	1
1:15	1
So,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
me	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
Rome	1
also.	1
	1
1:16	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
salvation	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth;	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Greek.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
therein	1
is	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
revealed	1
from	1
faith	1
to	1
faith:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
just	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
faith.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
revealed	1
from	1
heaven	1
against	1
all	1
ungodliness	1
and	1
unrighteousness	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
hold	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
unrighteousness;	1
1:19	1
Because	1
that	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
known	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
manifest	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
shewed	1
it	1
unto	1
them.	1
	1
1:20	1
For	1
the	1
invisible	1
things	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
clearly	1
seen,	1
being	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
made,	1
even	1
his	1
eternal	1
power	1
and	1
Godhead;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
excuse:	1
1:21	1
Because	1
that,	1
when	1
they	1
knew	1
God,	1
they	1
glorified	1
him	1
not	1
as	1
God,	1
neither	1
were	1
thankful;	1
but	1
became	1
vain	1
in	1
their	1
imaginations,	1
and	1
their	1
foolish	1
heart	1
was	1
darkened.	1
	1
1:22	1
Professing	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
wise,	1
they	1
became	1
fools,	1
1:23	1
And	1
changed	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
uncorruptible	1
God	1
into	1
an	1
image	1
made	1
like	1
to	1
corruptible	1
man,	1
and	1
to	1
birds,	1
and	1
fourfooted	1
beasts,	1
and	1
creeping	1
things.	1
	1
1:24	1
Wherefore	1
God	1
also	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
through	1
the	1
lusts	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
to	1
dishonour	1
their	1
own	1
bodies	1
between	1
themselves:	1
1:25	1
Who	1
changed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
into	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
worshipped	1
and	1
served	1
the	1
creature	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
Creator,	1
who	1
is	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
up	1
unto	1
vile	1
affections:	1
for	1
even	1
their	1
women	1
did	1
change	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
into	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
against	1
nature:	1
1:27	1
And	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
men,	1
leaving	1
the	1
natural	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
woman,	1
burned	1
in	1
their	1
lust	1
one	1
toward	1
another;	1
men	1
with	1
men	1
working	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unseemly,	1
and	1
receiving	1
in	1
themselves	1
that	1
recompence	1
of	1
their	1
error	1
which	1
was	1
meet.	1
	1
1:28	1
And	1
even	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
retain	1
God	1
in	1
their	1
knowledge,	1
God	1
gave	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
a	1
reprobate	1
mind,	1
to	1
do	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
convenient;	1
1:29	1
Being	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
unrighteousness,	1
fornication,	1
wickedness,	1
covetousness,	1
maliciousness;	1
full	1
of	1
envy,	1
murder,	1
debate,	1
deceit,	1
malignity;	1
whisperers,	1
1:30	1
Backbiters,	1
haters	1
of	1
God,	1
despiteful,	1
proud,	1
boasters,	1
inventors	1
of	1
evil	1
things,	1
disobedient	1
to	1
parents,	1
1:31	1
Without	1
understanding,	1
covenantbreakers,	1
without	1
natural	1
affection,	1
implacable,	1
unmerciful:	1
1:32	1
Who	1
knowing	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things	1
are	1
worthy	1
of	1
death,	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
them.	1
	1
2:1	1
Therefore	1
thou	1
art	1
inexcusable,	1
O	1
man,	1
whosoever	1
thou	1
art	1
that	1
judgest:	1
for	1
wherein	1
thou	1
judgest	1
another,	1
thou	1
condemnest	1
thyself;	1
for	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
doest	1
the	1
same	1
things.	1
	1
2:2	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
according	1
to	1
truth	1
against	1
them	1
which	1
commit	1
such	1
things.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
this,	1
O	1
man,	1
that	1
judgest	1
them	1
which	1
do	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
doest	1
the	1
same,	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
2:4	1
Or	1
despisest	1
thou	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
forbearance	1
and	1
longsuffering;	1
not	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
God	1
leadeth	1
thee	1
to	1
repentance?	1
	1
2:5	1
But	1
after	1
thy	1
hardness	1
and	1
impenitent	1
heart	1
treasurest	1
up	1
unto	1
thyself	1
wrath	1
against	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
righteous	1
judgment	1
of	1
God;	1
2:6	1
Who	1
will	1
render	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
deeds:	1
2:7	1
To	1
them	1
who	1
by	1
patient	1
continuance	1
in	1
well	1
doing	1
seek	1
for	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
and	1
immortality,	1
eternal	1
life:	1
2:8	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
contentious,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
obey	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
obey	1
unrighteousness,	1
indignation	1
and	1
wrath,	1
2:9	1
Tribulation	1
and	1
anguish,	1
upon	1
every	1
soul	1
of	1
man	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil,	1
of	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentile;	1
2:10	1
But	1
glory,	1
honour,	1
and	1
peace,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
worketh	1
good,	1
to	1
the	1
Jew	1
first,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
Gentile:	1
2:11	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
respect	1
of	1
persons	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
without	1
law	1
shall	1
also	1
perish	1
without	1
law:	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
have	1
sinned	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
law;	1
2:13	1
(For	1
not	1
the	1
hearers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
are	1
just	1
before	1
God,	1
but	1
the	1
doers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
justified.	1
	1
2:14	1
For	1
when	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
do	1
by	1
nature	1
the	1
things	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
these,	1
having	1
not	1
the	1
law,	1
are	1
a	1
law	1
unto	1
themselves:	1
2:15	1
Which	1
shew	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
written	1
in	1
their	1
hearts,	1
their	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
witness,	1
and	1
their	1
thoughts	1
the	1
mean	1
while	1
accusing	1
or	1
else	1
excusing	1
one	1
another;)	1
2:16	1
In	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
God	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
men	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel.	1
	1
2:17	1
Behold,	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
a	1
Jew,	1
and	1
restest	1
in	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
God,	1
2:18	1
And	1
knowest	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
approvest	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
more	1
excellent,	1
being	1
instructed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
2:19	1
And	1
art	1
confident	1
that	1
thou	1
thyself	1
art	1
a	1
guide	1
of	1
the	1
blind,	1
a	1
light	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
darkness,	1
2:20	1
An	1
instructor	1
of	1
the	1
foolish,	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
babes,	1
which	1
hast	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
2:21	1
Thou	1
therefore	1
which	1
teachest	1
another,	1
teachest	1
thou	1
not	1
thyself?	1
thou	1
that	1
preachest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
steal,	1
dost	1
thou	1
steal?	1
	1
2:22	1
Thou	1
that	1
sayest	1
a	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
adultery?	1
thou	1
that	1
abhorrest	1
idols,	1
dost	1
thou	1
commit	1
sacrilege?	1
	1
2:23	1
Thou	1
that	1
makest	1
thy	1
boast	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
through	1
breaking	1
the	1
law	1
dishonourest	1
thou	1
God?	1
	1
2:24	1
For	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
blasphemed	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
through	1
you,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written.	1
	1
2:25	1
For	1
circumcision	1
verily	1
profiteth,	1
if	1
thou	1
keep	1
the	1
law:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breaker	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
thy	1
circumcision	1
is	1
made	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
2:26	1
Therefore	1
if	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
keep	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
shall	1
not	1
his	1
uncircumcision	1
be	1
counted	1
for	1
circumcision?	1
	1
2:27	1
And	1
shall	1
not	1
uncircumcision	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
nature,	1
if	1
it	1
fulfil	1
the	1
law,	1
judge	1
thee,	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
circumcision	1
dost	1
transgress	1
the	1
law?	1
	1
2:28	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
outwardly;	1
neither	1
is	1
that	1
circumcision,	1
which	1
is	1
outward	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
2:29	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Jew,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
inwardly;	1
and	1
circumcision	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
in	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
letter;	1
whose	1
praise	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:1	1
What	1
advantage	1
then	1
hath	1
the	1
Jew?	1
or	1
what	1
profit	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
circumcision?	1
	1
3:2	1
Much	1
every	1
way:	1
chiefly,	1
because	1
that	1
unto	1
them	1
were	1
committed	1
the	1
oracles	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
what	1
if	1
some	1
did	1
not	1
believe?	1
shall	1
their	1
unbelief	1
make	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
effect?	1
	1
3:4	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
let	1
God	1
be	1
true,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
a	1
liar;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
That	1
thou	1
mightest	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
thy	1
sayings,	1
and	1
mightest	1
overcome	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
judged.	1
	1
3:5	1
But	1
if	1
our	1
unrighteousness	1
commend	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say?	1
Is	1
God	1
unrighteous	1
who	1
taketh	1
vengeance?	1
(I	1
speak	1
as	1
a	1
man)	1
3:6	1
God	1
forbid:	1
for	1
then	1
how	1
shall	1
God	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
	1
3:7	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
more	1
abounded	1
through	1
my	1
lie	1
unto	1
his	1
glory;	1
why	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
also	1
judged	1
as	1
a	1
sinner?	1
	1
3:8	1
And	1
not	1
rather,	1
(as	1
we	1
be	1
slanderously	1
reported,	1
and	1
as	1
some	1
affirm	1
that	1
we	1
say,)	1
Let	1
us	1
do	1
evil,	1
that	1
good	1
may	1
come?	1
whose	1
damnation	1
is	1
just.	1
	1
3:9	1
What	1
then?	1
are	1
we	1
better	1
than	1
they?	1
No,	1
in	1
no	1
wise:	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
proved	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
under	1
sin;	1
3:10	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
righteous,	1
no,	1
not	1
one:	1
3:11	1
There	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
understandeth,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
seeketh	1
after	1
God.	1
	1
3:12	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
they	1
are	1
together	1
become	1
unprofitable;	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
doeth	1
good,	1
no,	1
not	1
one.	1
	1
3:13	1
Their	1
throat	1
is	1
an	1
open	1
sepulchre;	1
with	1
their	1
tongues	1
they	1
have	1
used	1
deceit;	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
asps	1
is	1
under	1
their	1
lips:	1
3:14	1
Whose	1
mouth	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
cursing	1
and	1
bitterness:	1
3:15	1
Their	1
feet	1
are	1
swift	1
to	1
shed	1
blood:	1
3:16	1
Destruction	1
and	1
misery	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
ways:	1
3:17	1
And	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
peace	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
known:	1
3:18	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
before	1
their	1
eyes.	1
	1
3:19	1
Now	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
things	1
soever	1
the	1
law	1
saith,	1
it	1
saith	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law:	1
that	1
every	1
mouth	1
may	1
be	1
stopped,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
become	1
guilty	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
3:20	1
Therefore	1
by	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
there	1
shall	1
no	1
flesh	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
his	1
sight:	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
3:21	1
But	1
now	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
manifested,	1
being	1
witnessed	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
the	1
prophets;	1
3:22	1
Even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
faith	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
unto	1
all	1
and	1
upon	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe:	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference:	1
3:23	1
For	1
all	1
have	1
sinned,	1
and	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God;	1
3:24	1
Being	1
justified	1
freely	1
by	1
his	1
grace	1
through	1
the	1
redemption	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
3:25	1
Whom	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
propitiation	1
through	1
faith	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
righteousness	1
for	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
sins	1
that	1
are	1
past,	1
through	1
the	1
forbearance	1
of	1
God;	1
3:26	1
To	1
declare,	1
I	1
say,	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
his	1
righteousness:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
just,	1
and	1
the	1
justifier	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
believeth	1
in	1
Jesus.	1
	1
3:27	1
Where	1
is	1
boasting	1
then?	1
It	1
is	1
excluded.	1
By	1
what	1
law?	1
of	1
works?	1
Nay:	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
3:28	1
Therefore	1
we	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
faith	1
without	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
3:29	1
Is	1
he	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only?	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
Yes,	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
also:	1
3:30	1
Seeing	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
God,	1
which	1
shall	1
justify	1
the	1
circumcision	1
by	1
faith,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
through	1
faith.	1
	1
3:31	1
Do	1
we	1
then	1
make	1
void	1
the	1
law	1
through	1
faith?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
yea,	1
we	1
establish	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
4:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then	1
that	1
Abraham	1
our	1
father,	1
as	1
pertaining	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
hath	1
found?	1
	1
4:2	1
For	1
if	1
Abraham	1
were	1
justified	1
by	1
works,	1
he	1
hath	1
whereof	1
to	1
glory;	1
but	1
not	1
before	1
God.	1
	1
4:3	1
For	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
scripture?	1
Abraham	1
believed	1
God,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
counted	1
unto	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:4	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
is	1
the	1
reward	1
not	1
reckoned	1
of	1
grace,	1
but	1
of	1
debt.	1
	1
4:5	1
But	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
worketh	1
not,	1
but	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
justifieth	1
the	1
ungodly,	1
his	1
faith	1
is	1
counted	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:6	1
Even	1
as	1
David	1
also	1
describeth	1
the	1
blessedness	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
unto	1
whom	1
God	1
imputeth	1
righteousness	1
without	1
works,	1
4:7	1
Saying,	1
Blessed	1
are	1
they	1
whose	1
iniquities	1
are	1
forgiven,	1
and	1
whose	1
sins	1
are	1
covered.	1
	1
4:8	1
Blessed	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
Lord	1
will	1
not	1
impute	1
sin.	1
	1
4:9	1
Cometh	1
this	1
blessedness	1
then	1
upon	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
or	1
upon	1
the	1
uncircumcision	1
also?	1
for	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
faith	1
was	1
reckoned	1
to	1
Abraham	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:10	1
How	1
was	1
it	1
then	1
reckoned?	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
or	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
Not	1
in	1
circumcision,	1
but	1
in	1
uncircumcision.	1
	1
4:11	1
And	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
circumcision,	1
a	1
seal	1
of	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
being	1
uncircumcised:	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
all	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
circumcised;	1
that	1
righteousness	1
might	1
be	1
imputed	1
unto	1
them	1
also:	1
4:12	1
And	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
circumcision	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
only,	1
but	1
who	1
also	1
walk	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
that	1
faith	1
of	1
our	1
father	1
Abraham,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
being	1
yet	1
uncircumcised.	1
	1
4:13	1
For	1
the	1
promise,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
heir	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
Abraham,	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
seed,	1
through	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
through	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
4:14	1
For	1
if	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
be	1
heirs,	1
faith	1
is	1
made	1
void,	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect:	1
4:15	1
Because	1
the	1
law	1
worketh	1
wrath:	1
for	1
where	1
no	1
law	1
is,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
transgression.	1
	1
4:16	1
Therefore	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
faith,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
by	1
grace;	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
promise	1
might	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
seed;	1
not	1
to	1
that	1
only	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
also	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Abraham;	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
us	1
all,	1
4:17	1
(As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
thee	1
a	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,)	1
before	1
him	1
whom	1
he	1
believed,	1
even	1
God,	1
who	1
quickeneth	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
calleth	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
be	1
not	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were.	1
	1
4:18	1
Who	1
against	1
hope	1
believed	1
in	1
hope,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
many	1
nations,	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
spoken,	1
So	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be.	1
	1
4:19	1
And	1
being	1
not	1
weak	1
in	1
faith,	1
he	1
considered	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
body	1
now	1
dead,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
an	1
hundred	1
years	1
old,	1
neither	1
yet	1
the	1
deadness	1
of	1
Sarah's	1
womb:	1
4:20	1
He	1
staggered	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
God	1
through	1
unbelief;	1
but	1
was	1
strong	1
in	1
faith,	1
giving	1
glory	1
to	1
God;	1
4:21	1
And	1
being	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
promised,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
perform.	1
	1
4:22	1
And	1
therefore	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
righteousness.	1
	1
4:23	1
Now	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
written	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
alone,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
imputed	1
to	1
him;	1
4:24	1
But	1
for	1
us	1
also,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
imputed,	1
if	1
we	1
believe	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord	1
from	1
the	1
dead;	1
4:25	1
Who	1
was	1
delivered	1
for	1
our	1
offences,	1
and	1
was	1
raised	1
again	1
for	1
our	1
justification.	1
	1
5:1	1
Therefore	1
being	1
justified	1
by	1
faith,	1
we	1
have	1
peace	1
with	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
5:2	1
By	1
whom	1
also	1
we	1
have	1
access	1
by	1
faith	1
into	1
this	1
grace	1
wherein	1
we	1
stand,	1
and	1
rejoice	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
5:3	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
glory	1
in	1
tribulations	1
also:	1
knowing	1
that	1
tribulation	1
worketh	1
patience;	1
5:4	1
And	1
patience,	1
experience;	1
and	1
experience,	1
hope:	1
5:5	1
And	1
hope	1
maketh	1
not	1
ashamed;	1
because	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
shed	1
abroad	1
in	1
our	1
hearts	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
us.	1
	1
5:6	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
without	1
strength,	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
the	1
ungodly.	1
	1
5:7	1
For	1
scarcely	1
for	1
a	1
righteous	1
man	1
will	1
one	1
die:	1
yet	1
peradventure	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
man	1
some	1
would	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
die.	1
	1
5:8	1
But	1
God	1
commendeth	1
his	1
love	1
toward	1
us,	1
in	1
that,	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
yet	1
sinners,	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
5:9	1
Much	1
more	1
then,	1
being	1
now	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
blood,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
from	1
wrath	1
through	1
him.	1
	1
5:10	1
For	1
if,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
enemies,	1
we	1
were	1
reconciled	1
to	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
much	1
more,	1
being	1
reconciled,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
saved	1
by	1
his	1
life.	1
	1
5:11	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
so,	1
but	1
we	1
also	1
joy	1
in	1
God	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
received	1
the	1
atonement.	1
	1
5:12	1
Wherefore,	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man	1
sin	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
death	1
by	1
sin;	1
and	1
so	1
death	1
passed	1
upon	1
all	1
men,	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
have	1
sinned:	1
5:13	1
(For	1
until	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
world:	1
but	1
sin	1
is	1
not	1
imputed	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
law.	1
	1
5:14	1
Nevertheless	1
death	1
reigned	1
from	1
Adam	1
to	1
Moses,	1
even	1
over	1
them	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
sinned	1
after	1
the	1
similitude	1
of	1
Adam's	1
transgression,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
come.	1
	1
5:15	1
But	1
not	1
as	1
the	1
offence,	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
free	1
gift.	1
For	1
if	1
through	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
many	1
be	1
dead,	1
much	1
more	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
gift	1
by	1
grace,	1
which	1
is	1
by	1
one	1
man,	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
hath	1
abounded	1
unto	1
many.	1
	1
5:16	1
And	1
not	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
that	1
sinned,	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
gift:	1
for	1
the	1
judgment	1
was	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
condemnation,	1
but	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
is	1
of	1
many	1
offences	1
unto	1
justification.	1
	1
5:17	1
For	1
if	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
offence	1
death	1
reigned	1
by	1
one;	1
much	1
more	1
they	1
which	1
receive	1
abundance	1
of	1
grace	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
righteousness	1
shall	1
reign	1
in	1
life	1
by	1
one,	1
Jesus	1
Christ.)	1
	1
5:18	1
Therefore	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
one	1
judgment	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
condemnation;	1
even	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
one	1
the	1
free	1
gift	1
came	1
upon	1
all	1
men	1
unto	1
justification	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
5:19	1
For	1
as	1
by	1
one	1
man's	1
disobedience	1
many	1
were	1
made	1
sinners,	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
one	1
shall	1
many	1
be	1
made	1
righteous.	1
	1
5:20	1
Moreover	1
the	1
law	1
entered,	1
that	1
the	1
offence	1
might	1
abound.	1
But	1
where	1
sin	1
abounded,	1
grace	1
did	1
much	1
more	1
abound:	1
5:21	1
That	1
as	1
sin	1
hath	1
reigned	1
unto	1
death,	1
even	1
so	1
might	1
grace	1
reign	1
through	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
eternal	1
life	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:1	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Shall	1
we	1
continue	1
in	1
sin,	1
that	1
grace	1
may	1
abound?	1
	1
6:2	1
God	1
forbid.	1
How	1
shall	1
we,	1
that	1
are	1
dead	1
to	1
sin,	1
live	1
any	1
longer	1
therein?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
were	1
baptized	1
into	1
his	1
death?	1
	1
6:4	1
Therefore	1
we	1
are	1
buried	1
with	1
him	1
by	1
baptism	1
into	1
death:	1
that	1
like	1
as	1
Christ	1
was	1
raised	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
by	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Father,	1
even	1
so	1
we	1
also	1
should	1
walk	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
life.	1
	1
6:5	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
planted	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
his	1
resurrection:	1
6:6	1
Knowing	1
this,	1
that	1
our	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
crucified	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
sin	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
that	1
henceforth	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
serve	1
sin.	1
	1
6:7	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
dead	1
is	1
freed	1
from	1
sin.	1
	1
6:8	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
be	1
dead	1
with	1
Christ,	1
we	1
believe	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
live	1
with	1
him:	1
6:9	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Christ	1
being	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dieth	1
no	1
more;	1
death	1
hath	1
no	1
more	1
dominion	1
over	1
him.	1
	1
6:10	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
died	1
unto	1
sin	1
once:	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
he	1
liveth,	1
he	1
liveth	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
Likewise	1
reckon	1
ye	1
also	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
dead	1
indeed	1
unto	1
sin,	1
but	1
alive	1
unto	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
6:12	1
Let	1
not	1
sin	1
therefore	1
reign	1
in	1
your	1
mortal	1
body,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
obey	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
6:13	1
Neither	1
yield	1
ye	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
unrighteousness	1
unto	1
sin:	1
but	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
unto	1
God,	1
as	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
alive	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
your	1
members	1
as	1
instruments	1
of	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
6:14	1
For	1
sin	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
dominion	1
over	1
you:	1
for	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace.	1
	1
6:15	1
What	1
then?	1
shall	1
we	1
sin,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
but	1
under	1
grace?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
that	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
yield	1
yourselves	1
servants	1
to	1
obey,	1
his	1
servants	1
ye	1
are	1
to	1
whom	1
ye	1
obey;	1
whether	1
of	1
sin	1
unto	1
death,	1
or	1
of	1
obedience	1
unto	1
righteousness?	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
God	1
be	1
thanked,	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
obeyed	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
that	1
form	1
of	1
doctrine	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
you.	1
	1
6:18	1
Being	1
then	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
ye	1
became	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:19	1
I	1
speak	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
infirmity	1
of	1
your	1
flesh:	1
for	1
as	1
ye	1
have	1
yielded	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
to	1
iniquity	1
unto	1
iniquity;	1
even	1
so	1
now	1
yield	1
your	1
members	1
servants	1
to	1
righteousness	1
unto	1
holiness.	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
when	1
ye	1
were	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
sin,	1
ye	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
righteousness.	1
	1
6:21	1
What	1
fruit	1
had	1
ye	1
then	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
are	1
now	1
ashamed?	1
	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
6:22	1
But	1
now	1
being	1
made	1
free	1
from	1
sin,	1
and	1
become	1
servants	1
to	1
God,	1
ye	1
have	1
your	1
fruit	1
unto	1
holiness,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
everlasting	1
life.	1
	1
6:23	1
For	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
eternal	1
life	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:1	1
Know	1
ye	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
(for	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
know	1
the	1
law,)	1
how	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
hath	1
dominion	1
over	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth?	1
	1
7:2	1
For	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
loosed	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
So	1
then	1
if,	1
while	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth,	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man,	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
adulteress:	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
free	1
from	1
that	1
law;	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
no	1
adulteress,	1
though	1
she	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another	1
man.	1
	1
7:4	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
become	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ;	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
another,	1
even	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
God.	1
	1
7:5	1
For	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
the	1
motions	1
of	1
sins,	1
which	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
law,	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
our	1
members	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
fruit	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
being	1
dead	1
wherein	1
we	1
were	1
held;	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
serve	1
in	1
newness	1
of	1
spirit,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
oldness	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
	1
7:7	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
the	1
law	1
sin?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
Nay,	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
sin,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
law:	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
lust,	1
except	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
said,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet.	1
	1
7:8	1
But	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
wrought	1
in	1
me	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
concupiscence.	1
For	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
sin	1
was	1
dead.	1
	1
7:9	1
For	1
I	1
was	1
alive	1
without	1
the	1
law	1
once:	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
commandment	1
came,	1
sin	1
revived,	1
and	1
I	1
died.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
the	1
commandment,	1
which	1
was	1
ordained	1
to	1
life,	1
I	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
unto	1
death.	1
	1
7:11	1
For	1
sin,	1
taking	1
occasion	1
by	1
the	1
commandment,	1
deceived	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
slew	1
me.	1
	1
7:12	1
Wherefore	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
holy,	1
and	1
the	1
commandment	1
holy,	1
and	1
just,	1
and	1
good.	1
	1
7:13	1
Was	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
made	1
death	1
unto	1
me?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
But	1
sin,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
appear	1
sin,	1
working	1
death	1
in	1
me	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good;	1
that	1
sin	1
by	1
the	1
commandment	1
might	1
become	1
exceeding	1
sinful.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
spiritual:	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
carnal,	1
sold	1
under	1
sin.	1
	1
7:15	1
For	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
I	1
allow	1
not:	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
would,	1
that	1
do	1
I	1
not;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
hate,	1
that	1
do	1
I.	1
	1
7:16	1
If	1
then	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
I	1
consent	1
unto	1
the	1
law	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
7:17	1
Now	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:18	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
me	1
(that	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
flesh,)	1
dwelleth	1
no	1
good	1
thing:	1
for	1
to	1
will	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
how	1
to	1
perform	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good	1
I	1
find	1
not.	1
	1
7:19	1
For	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
do	1
not:	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
that	1
I	1
do.	1
	1
7:20	1
Now	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
that	1
do	1
it,	1
but	1
sin	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
me.	1
	1
7:21	1
I	1
find	1
then	1
a	1
law,	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
good,	1
evil	1
is	1
present	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
I	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God	1
after	1
the	1
inward	1
man:	1
7:23	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
another	1
law	1
in	1
my	1
members,	1
warring	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
bringing	1
me	1
into	1
captivity	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
members.	1
	1
7:24	1
O	1
wretched	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
who	1
shall	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
this	1
death?	1
	1
7:25	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
So	1
then	1
with	1
the	1
mind	1
I	1
myself	1
serve	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
flesh	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin.	1
	1
8:1	1
There	1
is	1
therefore	1
now	1
no	1
condemnation	1
to	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:2	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
hath	1
made	1
me	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
sin	1
and	1
death.	1
	1
8:3	1
For	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
could	1
not	1
do,	1
in	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
weak	1
through	1
the	1
flesh,	1
God	1
sending	1
his	1
own	1
Son	1
in	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
sinful	1
flesh,	1
and	1
for	1
sin,	1
condemned	1
sin	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
8:4	1
That	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
might	1
be	1
fulfilled	1
in	1
us,	1
who	1
walk	1
not	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
flesh	1
do	1
mind	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
flesh;	1
but	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit.	1
	1
8:6	1
For	1
to	1
be	1
carnally	1
minded	1
is	1
death;	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
spiritually	1
minded	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
peace.	1
	1
8:7	1
Because	1
the	1
carnal	1
mind	1
is	1
enmity	1
against	1
God:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
God,	1
neither	1
indeed	1
can	1
be.	1
	1
8:8	1
So	1
then	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
flesh	1
cannot	1
please	1
God.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwell	1
in	1
you.	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
Christ,	1
he	1
is	1
none	1
of	1
his.	1
	1
8:10	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
in	1
you,	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
dead	1
because	1
of	1
sin;	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
life	1
because	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
8:11	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Jesus	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
dwell	1
in	1
you,	1
he	1
that	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ	1
from	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
also	1
quicken	1
your	1
mortal	1
bodies	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit	1
that	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you.	1
	1
8:12	1
Therefore,	1
brethren,	1
we	1
are	1
debtors,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh.	1
	1
8:13	1
For	1
if	1
ye	1
live	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
ye	1
shall	1
die:	1
but	1
if	1
ye	1
through	1
the	1
Spirit	1
do	1
mortify	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
ye	1
shall	1
live.	1
	1
8:14	1
For	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
are	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:15	1
For	1
ye	1
have	1
not	1
received	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
bondage	1
again	1
to	1
fear;	1
but	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
adoption,	1
whereby	1
we	1
cry,	1
Abba,	1
Father.	1
	1
8:16	1
The	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
beareth	1
witness	1
with	1
our	1
spirit,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
8:17	1
And	1
if	1
children,	1
then	1
heirs;	1
heirs	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
joint-heirs	1
with	1
Christ;	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
suffer	1
with	1
him,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
also	1
glorified	1
together.	1
	1
8:18	1
For	1
I	1
reckon	1
that	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
are	1
not	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
glory	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
in	1
us.	1
	1
8:19	1
For	1
the	1
earnest	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
creature	1
waiteth	1
for	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:20	1
For	1
the	1
creature	1
was	1
made	1
subject	1
to	1
vanity,	1
not	1
willingly,	1
but	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
hath	1
subjected	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
hope,	1
8:21	1
Because	1
the	1
creature	1
itself	1
also	1
shall	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
bondage	1
of	1
corruption	1
into	1
the	1
glorious	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:22	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
creation	1
groaneth	1
and	1
travaileth	1
in	1
pain	1
together	1
until	1
now.	1
	1
8:23	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
they,	1
but	1
ourselves	1
also,	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
even	1
we	1
ourselves	1
groan	1
within	1
ourselves,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
adoption,	1
to	1
wit,	1
the	1
redemption	1
of	1
our	1
body.	1
	1
8:24	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
hope:	1
but	1
hope	1
that	1
is	1
seen	1
is	1
not	1
hope:	1
for	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
seeth,	1
why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
hope	1
for?	1
	1
8:25	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
hope	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
not,	1
then	1
do	1
we	1
with	1
patience	1
wait	1
for	1
it.	1
	1
8:26	1
Likewise	1
the	1
Spirit	1
also	1
helpeth	1
our	1
infirmities:	1
for	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
we	1
should	1
pray	1
for	1
as	1
we	1
ought:	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
itself	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us	1
with	1
groanings	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
uttered.	1
	1
8:27	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
searcheth	1
the	1
hearts	1
knoweth	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
because	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
the	1
saints	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:28	1
And	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
work	1
together	1
for	1
good	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
God,	1
to	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
called	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
purpose.	1
	1
8:29	1
For	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
foreknow,	1
he	1
also	1
did	1
predestinate	1
to	1
be	1
conformed	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
his	1
Son,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
firstborn	1
among	1
many	1
brethren.	1
	1
8:30	1
Moreover	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
predestinate,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
called:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
called,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
justified:	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
justified,	1
them	1
he	1
also	1
glorified.	1
	1
8:31	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
then	1
say	1
to	1
these	1
things?	1
If	1
God	1
be	1
for	1
us,	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
against	1
us?	1
	1
8:32	1
He	1
that	1
spared	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
Son,	1
but	1
delivered	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
us	1
all,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
not	1
with	1
him	1
also	1
freely	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
things?	1
	1
8:33	1
Who	1
shall	1
lay	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
God's	1
elect?	1
It	1
is	1
God	1
that	1
justifieth.	1
	1
8:34	1
Who	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth?	1
It	1
is	1
Christ	1
that	1
died,	1
yea	1
rather,	1
that	1
is	1
risen	1
again,	1
who	1
is	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
hand	1
of	1
God,	1
who	1
also	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
for	1
us.	1
	1
8:35	1
Who	1
shall	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
tribulation,	1
or	1
distress,	1
or	1
persecution,	1
or	1
famine,	1
or	1
nakedness,	1
or	1
peril,	1
or	1
sword?	1
	1
8:36	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
thy	1
sake	1
we	1
are	1
killed	1
all	1
the	1
day	1
long;	1
we	1
are	1
accounted	1
as	1
sheep	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter.	1
	1
8:37	1
Nay,	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
we	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
conquerors	1
through	1
him	1
that	1
loved	1
us.	1
	1
8:38	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
that	1
neither	1
death,	1
nor	1
life,	1
nor	1
angels,	1
nor	1
principalities,	1
nor	1
powers,	1
nor	1
things	1
present,	1
nor	1
things	1
to	1
come,	1
8:39	1
Nor	1
height,	1
nor	1
depth,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
creature,	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
separate	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:1	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
Christ,	1
I	1
lie	1
not,	1
my	1
conscience	1
also	1
bearing	1
me	1
witness	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost,	1
9:2	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
heaviness	1
and	1
continual	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart.	1
	1
9:3	1
For	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
that	1
myself	1
were	1
accursed	1
from	1
Christ	1
for	1
my	1
brethren,	1
my	1
kinsmen	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flesh:	1
9:4	1
Who	1
are	1
Israelites;	1
to	1
whom	1
pertaineth	1
the	1
adoption,	1
and	1
the	1
glory,	1
and	1
the	1
covenants,	1
and	1
the	1
giving	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
promises;	1
9:5	1
Whose	1
are	1
the	1
fathers,	1
and	1
of	1
whom	1
as	1
concerning	1
the	1
flesh	1
Christ	1
came,	1
who	1
is	1
over	1
all,	1
God	1
blessed	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
9:6	1
Not	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
hath	1
taken	1
none	1
effect.	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
Israel,	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Israel:	1
9:7	1
Neither,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
children:	1
but,	1
In	1
Isaac	1
shall	1
thy	1
seed	1
be	1
called.	1
	1
9:8	1
That	1
is,	1
They	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
are	1
counted	1
for	1
the	1
seed.	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
promise,	1
At	1
this	1
time	1
will	1
I	1
come,	1
and	1
Sarah	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
	1
9:10	1
And	1
not	1
only	1
this;	1
but	1
when	1
Rebecca	1
also	1
had	1
conceived	1
by	1
one,	1
even	1
by	1
our	1
father	1
Isaac;	1
9:11	1
(For	1
the	1
children	1
being	1
not	1
yet	1
born,	1
neither	1
having	1
done	1
any	1
good	1
or	1
evil,	1
that	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
God	1
according	1
to	1
election	1
might	1
stand,	1
not	1
of	1
works,	1
but	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
calleth;)	1
9:12	1
It	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
her,	1
The	1
elder	1
shall	1
serve	1
the	1
younger.	1
	1
9:13	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Jacob	1
have	1
I	1
loved,	1
but	1
Esau	1
have	1
I	1
hated.	1
	1
9:14	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
Is	1
there	1
unrighteousness	1
with	1
God?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
9:15	1
For	1
he	1
saith	1
to	1
Moses,	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
compassion.	1
	1
9:16	1
So	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
willeth,	1
nor	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
runneth,	1
but	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy.	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
unto	1
Pharaoh,	1
Even	1
for	1
this	1
same	1
purpose	1
have	1
I	1
raised	1
thee	1
up,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
shew	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
might	1
be	1
declared	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:18	1
Therefore	1
hath	1
he	1
mercy	1
on	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
mercy,	1
and	1
whom	1
he	1
will	1
he	1
hardeneth.	1
	1
9:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then	1
unto	1
me,	1
Why	1
doth	1
he	1
yet	1
find	1
fault?	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
resisted	1
his	1
will?	1
	1
9:20	1
Nay	1
but,	1
O	1
man,	1
who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
repliest	1
against	1
God?	1
Shall	1
the	1
thing	1
formed	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
formed	1
it,	1
Why	1
hast	1
thou	1
made	1
me	1
thus?	1
	1
9:21	1
Hath	1
not	1
the	1
potter	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
clay,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
lump	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
vessel	1
unto	1
honour,	1
and	1
another	1
unto	1
dishonour?	1
	1
9:22	1
What	1
if	1
God,	1
willing	1
to	1
shew	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
power	1
known,	1
endured	1
with	1
much	1
longsuffering	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
wrath	1
fitted	1
to	1
destruction:	1
9:23	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
his	1
glory	1
on	1
the	1
vessels	1
of	1
mercy,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
afore	1
prepared	1
unto	1
glory,	1
9:24	1
Even	1
us,	1
whom	1
he	1
hath	1
called,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
Jews	1
only,	1
but	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles?	1
	1
9:25	1
As	1
he	1
saith	1
also	1
in	1
Osee,	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
them	1
my	1
people,	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
and	1
her	1
beloved,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
beloved.	1
	1
9:26	1
And	1
it	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
said	1
unto	1
them,	1
Ye	1
are	1
not	1
my	1
people;	1
there	1
shall	1
they	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
God.	1
	1
9:27	1
Esaias	1
also	1
crieth	1
concerning	1
Israel,	1
Though	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
Israel	1
be	1
as	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
a	1
remnant	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
9:28	1
For	1
he	1
will	1
finish	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
short	1
in	1
righteousness:	1
because	1
a	1
short	1
work	1
will	1
the	1
Lord	1
make	1
upon	1
the	1
earth.	1
	1
9:29	1
And	1
as	1
Esaias	1
said	1
before,	1
Except	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
Sabaoth	1
had	1
left	1
us	1
a	1
seed,	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
Sodoma,	1
and	1
been	1
made	1
like	1
unto	1
Gomorrha.	1
	1
9:30	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
then?	1
That	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
which	1
followed	1
not	1
after	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
attained	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
even	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
9:31	1
But	1
Israel,	1
which	1
followed	1
after	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness,	1
hath	1
not	1
attained	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
righteousness.	1
	1
9:32	1
Wherefore?	1
Because	1
they	1
sought	1
it	1
not	1
by	1
faith,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
For	1
they	1
stumbled	1
at	1
that	1
stumblingstone;	1
9:33	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Behold,	1
I	1
lay	1
in	1
Sion	1
a	1
stumblingstone	1
and	1
rock	1
of	1
offence:	1
and	1
whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:1	1
Brethren,	1
my	1
heart's	1
desire	1
and	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
Israel	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:2	1
For	1
I	1
bear	1
them	1
record	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
zeal	1
of	1
God,	1
but	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
knowledge.	1
	1
10:3	1
For	1
they	1
being	1
ignorant	1
of	1
God's	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
going	1
about	1
to	1
establish	1
their	1
own	1
righteousness,	1
have	1
not	1
submitted	1
themselves	1
unto	1
the	1
righteousness	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:4	1
For	1
Christ	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
for	1
righteousness	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
that	1
believeth.	1
	1
10:5	1
For	1
Moses	1
describeth	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
That	1
the	1
man	1
which	1
doeth	1
those	1
things	1
shall	1
live	1
by	1
them.	1
	1
10:6	1
But	1
the	1
righteousness	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
faith	1
speaketh	1
on	1
this	1
wise,	1
Say	1
not	1
in	1
thine	1
heart,	1
Who	1
shall	1
ascend	1
into	1
heaven?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
Christ	1
down	1
from	1
above:)	1
10:7	1
Or,	1
Who	1
shall	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
deep?	1
(that	1
is,	1
to	1
bring	1
up	1
Christ	1
again	1
from	1
the	1
dead.)	1
	1
10:8	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
it?	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
nigh	1
thee,	1
even	1
in	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
heart:	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
faith,	1
which	1
we	1
preach;	1
10:9	1
That	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
confess	1
with	1
thy	1
mouth	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
shalt	1
believe	1
in	1
thine	1
heart	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
raised	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:10	1
For	1
with	1
the	1
heart	1
man	1
believeth	1
unto	1
righteousness;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mouth	1
confession	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
salvation.	1
	1
10:11	1
For	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith,	1
Whosoever	1
believeth	1
on	1
him	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
ashamed.	1
	1
10:12	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
Jew	1
and	1
the	1
Greek:	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
Lord	1
over	1
all	1
is	1
rich	1
unto	1
all	1
that	1
call	1
upon	1
him.	1
	1
10:13	1
For	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
shall	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
10:14	1
How	1
then	1
shall	1
they	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
believed?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
believe	1
in	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
heard?	1
and	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
hear	1
without	1
a	1
preacher?	1
	1
10:15	1
And	1
how	1
shall	1
they	1
preach,	1
except	1
they	1
be	1
sent?	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
How	1
beautiful	1
are	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
bring	1
glad	1
tidings	1
of	1
good	1
things!	1
	1
10:16	1
But	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all	1
obeyed	1
the	1
gospel.	1
For	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
Lord,	1
who	1
hath	1
believed	1
our	1
report?	1
	1
10:17	1
So	1
then	1
faith	1
cometh	1
by	1
hearing,	1
and	1
hearing	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:18	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Have	1
they	1
not	1
heard?	1
Yes	1
verily,	1
their	1
sound	1
went	1
into	1
all	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
their	1
words	1
unto	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
10:19	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
Did	1
not	1
Israel	1
know?	1
First	1
Moses	1
saith,	1
I	1
will	1
provoke	1
you	1
to	1
jealousy	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
no	1
people,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
foolish	1
nation	1
I	1
will	1
anger	1
you.	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
Esaias	1
is	1
very	1
bold,	1
and	1
saith,	1
I	1
was	1
found	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
sought	1
me	1
not;	1
I	1
was	1
made	1
manifest	1
unto	1
them	1
that	1
asked	1
not	1
after	1
me.	1
	1
10:21	1
But	1
to	1
Israel	1
he	1
saith,	1
All	1
day	1
long	1
I	1
have	1
stretched	1
forth	1
my	1
hands	1
unto	1
a	1
disobedient	1
and	1
gainsaying	1
people.	1
	1
11:1	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Hath	1
God	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
For	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
an	1
Israelite,	1
of	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
Abraham,	1
of	1
the	1
tribe	1
of	1
Benjamin.	1
	1
11:2	1
God	1
hath	1
not	1
cast	1
away	1
his	1
people	1
which	1
he	1
foreknew.	1
Wot	1
ye	1
not	1
what	1
the	1
scripture	1
saith	1
of	1
Elias?	1
how	1
he	1
maketh	1
intercession	1
to	1
God	1
against	1
Israel	1
saying,	1
11:3	1
Lord,	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
thy	1
prophets,	1
and	1
digged	1
down	1
thine	1
altars;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
they	1
seek	1
my	1
life.	1
	1
11:4	1
But	1
what	1
saith	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
God	1
unto	1
him?	1
I	1
have	1
reserved	1
to	1
myself	1
seven	1
thousand	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
bowed	1
the	1
knee	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
Baal.	1
	1
11:5	1
Even	1
so	1
then	1
at	1
this	1
present	1
time	1
also	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
remnant	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
grace.	1
	1
11:6	1
And	1
if	1
by	1
grace,	1
then	1
is	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
works:	1
otherwise	1
grace	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
of	1
works,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
grace:	1
otherwise	1
work	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
work.	1
	1
11:7	1
What	1
then?	1
Israel	1
hath	1
not	1
obtained	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
seeketh	1
for;	1
but	1
the	1
election	1
hath	1
obtained	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
were	1
blinded.	1
	1
11:8	1
(According	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
God	1
hath	1
given	1
them	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
slumber,	1
eyes	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
ears	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
hear;)	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
11:9	1
And	1
David	1
saith,	1
Let	1
their	1
table	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
snare,	1
and	1
a	1
trap,	1
and	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
a	1
recompence	1
unto	1
them:	1
11:10	1
Let	1
their	1
eyes	1
be	1
darkened,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
see,	1
and	1
bow	1
down	1
their	1
back	1
alway.	1
	1
11:11	1
I	1
say	1
then,	1
Have	1
they	1
stumbled	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
fall?	1
God	1
forbid:	1
but	1
rather	1
through	1
their	1
fall	1
salvation	1
is	1
come	1
unto	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
for	1
to	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
	1
11:12	1
Now	1
if	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
diminishing	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
their	1
fulness?	1
	1
11:13	1
For	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
Gentiles,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
apostle	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
I	1
magnify	1
mine	1
office:	1
11:14	1
If	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
I	1
may	1
provoke	1
to	1
emulation	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
might	1
save	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
	1
11:15	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
casting	1
away	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
reconciling	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
what	1
shall	1
the	1
receiving	1
of	1
them	1
be,	1
but	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
11:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
firstfruit	1
be	1
holy,	1
the	1
lump	1
is	1
also	1
holy:	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
root	1
be	1
holy,	1
so	1
are	1
the	1
branches.	1
	1
11:17	1
And	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
be	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou,	1
being	1
a	1
wild	1
olive	1
tree,	1
wert	1
graffed	1
in	1
among	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
partakest	1
of	1
the	1
root	1
and	1
fatness	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree;	1
11:18	1
Boast	1
not	1
against	1
the	1
branches.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
boast,	1
thou	1
bearest	1
not	1
the	1
root,	1
but	1
the	1
root	1
thee.	1
	1
11:19	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
then,	1
The	1
branches	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
graffed	1
in.	1
	1
11:20	1
Well;	1
because	1
of	1
unbelief	1
they	1
were	1
broken	1
off,	1
and	1
thou	1
standest	1
by	1
faith.	1
Be	1
not	1
highminded,	1
but	1
fear:	1
11:21	1
For	1
if	1
God	1
spared	1
not	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
also	1
spare	1
not	1
thee.	1
	1
11:22	1
Behold	1
therefore	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
severity	1
of	1
God:	1
on	1
them	1
which	1
fell,	1
severity;	1
but	1
toward	1
thee,	1
goodness,	1
if	1
thou	1
continue	1
in	1
his	1
goodness:	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
also	1
shalt	1
be	1
cut	1
off.	1
	1
11:23	1
And	1
they	1
also,	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
not	1
still	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
shall	1
be	1
graffed	1
in:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
graff	1
them	1
in	1
again.	1
	1
11:24	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
cut	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
olive	1
tree	1
which	1
is	1
wild	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
wert	1
graffed	1
contrary	1
to	1
nature	1
into	1
a	1
good	1
olive	1
tree:	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
shall	1
these,	1
which	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
branches,	1
be	1
graffed	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
olive	1
tree?	1
	1
11:25	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
not,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
this	1
mystery,	1
lest	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits;	1
that	1
blindness	1
in	1
part	1
is	1
happened	1
to	1
Israel,	1
until	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
be	1
come	1
in.	1
	1
11:26	1
And	1
so	1
all	1
Israel	1
shall	1
be	1
saved:	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
There	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
Sion	1
the	1
Deliverer,	1
and	1
shall	1
turn	1
away	1
ungodliness	1
from	1
Jacob:	1
11:27	1
For	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
covenant	1
unto	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
sins.	1
	1
11:28	1
As	1
concerning	1
the	1
gospel,	1
they	1
are	1
enemies	1
for	1
your	1
sakes:	1
but	1
as	1
touching	1
the	1
election,	1
they	1
are	1
beloved	1
for	1
the	1
father's	1
sakes.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
the	1
gifts	1
and	1
calling	1
of	1
God	1
are	1
without	1
repentance.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
as	1
ye	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
have	1
not	1
believed	1
God,	1
yet	1
have	1
now	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
through	1
their	1
unbelief:	1
11:31	1
Even	1
so	1
have	1
these	1
also	1
now	1
not	1
believed,	1
that	1
through	1
your	1
mercy	1
they	1
also	1
may	1
obtain	1
mercy.	1
	1
11:32	1
For	1
God	1
hath	1
concluded	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
unbelief,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
mercy	1
upon	1
all.	1
	1
11:33	1
O	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
riches	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God!	1
	1
how	1
unsearchable	1
are	1
his	1
judgments,	1
and	1
his	1
ways	1
past	1
finding	1
out!	1
	1
11:34	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord?	1
or	1
who	1
hath	1
been	1
his	1
counsellor?	1
	1
11:35	1
Or	1
who	1
hath	1
first	1
given	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
recompensed	1
unto	1
him	1
again?	1
	1
11:36	1
For	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
through	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
are	1
all	1
things:	1
to	1
whom	1
be	1
glory	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
12:1	1
I	1
beseech	1
you	1
therefore,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
mercies	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
ye	1
present	1
your	1
bodies	1
a	1
living	1
sacrifice,	1
holy,	1
acceptable	1
unto	1
God,	1
which	1
is	1
your	1
reasonable	1
service.	1
	1
12:2	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
conformed	1
to	1
this	1
world:	1
but	1
be	1
ye	1
transformed	1
by	1
the	1
renewing	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prove	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
good,	1
and	1
acceptable,	1
and	1
perfect,	1
will	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
12:3	1
For	1
I	1
say,	1
through	1
the	1
grace	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
among	1
you,	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
himself	1
more	1
highly	1
than	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
think;	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
soberly,	1
according	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
dealt	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
faith.	1
	1
12:4	1
For	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
many	1
members	1
in	1
one	1
body,	1
and	1
all	1
members	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
office:	1
12:5	1
So	1
we,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
members	1
one	1
of	1
another.	1
	1
12:6	1
Having	1
then	1
gifts	1
differing	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
us,	1
whether	1
prophecy,	1
let	1
us	1
prophesy	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
faith;	1
12:7	1
Or	1
ministry,	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
on	1
our	1
ministering:	1
or	1
he	1
that	1
teacheth,	1
on	1
teaching;	1
12:8	1
Or	1
he	1
that	1
exhorteth,	1
on	1
exhortation:	1
he	1
that	1
giveth,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
simplicity;	1
he	1
that	1
ruleth,	1
with	1
diligence;	1
he	1
that	1
sheweth	1
mercy,	1
with	1
cheerfulness.	1
	1
12:9	1
Let	1
love	1
be	1
without	1
dissimulation.	1
Abhor	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil;	1
cleave	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
	1
12:10	1
Be	1
kindly	1
affectioned	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
brotherly	1
love;	1
in	1
honour	1
preferring	1
one	1
another;	1
12:11	1
Not	1
slothful	1
in	1
business;	1
fervent	1
in	1
spirit;	1
serving	1
the	1
Lord;	1
12:12	1
Rejoicing	1
in	1
hope;	1
patient	1
in	1
tribulation;	1
continuing	1
instant	1
in	1
prayer;	1
12:13	1
Distributing	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saints;	1
given	1
to	1
hospitality.	1
	1
12:14	1
Bless	1
them	1
which	1
persecute	1
you:	1
bless,	1
and	1
curse	1
not.	1
	1
12:15	1
Rejoice	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
rejoice,	1
and	1
weep	1
with	1
them	1
that	1
weep.	1
	1
12:16	1
Be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
one	1
toward	1
another.	1
Mind	1
not	1
high	1
things,	1
but	1
condescend	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
estate.	1
Be	1
not	1
wise	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
conceits.	1
	1
12:17	1
Recompense	1
to	1
no	1
man	1
evil	1
for	1
evil.	1
Provide	1
things	1
honest	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:18	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
lieth	1
in	1
you,	1
live	1
peaceably	1
with	1
all	1
men.	1
	1
12:19	1
Dearly	1
beloved,	1
avenge	1
not	1
yourselves,	1
but	1
rather	1
give	1
place	1
unto	1
wrath:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Vengeance	1
is	1
mine;	1
I	1
will	1
repay,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:20	1
Therefore	1
if	1
thine	1
enemy	1
hunger,	1
feed	1
him;	1
if	1
he	1
thirst,	1
give	1
him	1
drink:	1
for	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
shalt	1
heap	1
coals	1
of	1
fire	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
12:21	1
Be	1
not	1
overcome	1
of	1
evil,	1
but	1
overcome	1
evil	1
with	1
good.	1
	1
13:1	1
Let	1
every	1
soul	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
the	1
higher	1
powers.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
but	1
of	1
God:	1
the	1
powers	1
that	1
be	1
are	1
ordained	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
13:2	1
Whosoever	1
therefore	1
resisteth	1
the	1
power,	1
resisteth	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
God:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
resist	1
shall	1
receive	1
to	1
themselves	1
damnation.	1
	1
13:3	1
For	1
rulers	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
terror	1
to	1
good	1
works,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
evil.	1
Wilt	1
thou	1
then	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
power?	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
same:	1
13:4	1
For	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
thee	1
for	1
good.	1
But	1
if	1
thou	1
do	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
evil,	1
be	1
afraid;	1
for	1
he	1
beareth	1
not	1
the	1
sword	1
in	1
vain:	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
God,	1
a	1
revenger	1
to	1
execute	1
wrath	1
upon	1
him	1
that	1
doeth	1
evil.	1
	1
13:5	1
Wherefore	1
ye	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
subject,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
wrath,	1
but	1
also	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
13:6	1
For	1
for	1
this	1
cause	1
pay	1
ye	1
tribute	1
also:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
God's	1
ministers,	1
attending	1
continually	1
upon	1
this	1
very	1
thing.	1
	1
13:7	1
Render	1
therefore	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
dues:	1
tribute	1
to	1
whom	1
tribute	1
is	1
due;	1
custom	1
to	1
whom	1
custom;	1
fear	1
to	1
whom	1
fear;	1
honour	1
to	1
whom	1
honour.	1
	1
13:8	1
Owe	1
no	1
man	1
any	1
thing,	1
but	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
another:	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
loveth	1
another	1
hath	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
this,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
commit	1
adultery,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
kill,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
steal,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
bear	1
false	1
witness,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
covet;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
commandment,	1
it	1
is	1
briefly	1
comprehended	1
in	1
this	1
saying,	1
namely,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
love	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
as	1
thyself.	1
	1
13:10	1
Love	1
worketh	1
no	1
ill	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour:	1
therefore	1
love	1
is	1
the	1
fulfilling	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
13:11	1
And	1
that,	1
knowing	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
to	1
awake	1
out	1
of	1
sleep:	1
for	1
now	1
is	1
our	1
salvation	1
nearer	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
believed.	1
	1
13:12	1
The	1
night	1
is	1
far	1
spent,	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
at	1
hand:	1
let	1
us	1
therefore	1
cast	1
off	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
light.	1
	1
13:13	1
Let	1
us	1
walk	1
honestly,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
day;	1
not	1
in	1
rioting	1
and	1
drunkenness,	1
not	1
in	1
chambering	1
and	1
wantonness,	1
not	1
in	1
strife	1
and	1
envying.	1
	1
13:14	1
But	1
put	1
ye	1
on	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
not	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
flesh,	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
lusts	1
thereof.	1
	1
14:1	1
Him	1
that	1
is	1
weak	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
receive	1
ye,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
doubtful	1
disputations.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
one	1
believeth	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
eat	1
all	1
things:	1
another,	1
who	1
is	1
weak,	1
eateth	1
herbs.	1
	1
14:3	1
Let	1
not	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
despise	1
him	1
that	1
eateth	1
not;	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
him	1
which	1
eateth	1
not	1
judge	1
him	1
that	1
eateth:	1
for	1
God	1
hath	1
received	1
him.	1
	1
14:4	1
Who	1
art	1
thou	1
that	1
judgest	1
another	1
man's	1
servant?	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
master	1
he	1
standeth	1
or	1
falleth.	1
Yea,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
holden	1
up:	1
for	1
God	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
stand.	1
	1
14:5	1
One	1
man	1
esteemeth	1
one	1
day	1
above	1
another:	1
another	1
esteemeth	1
every	1
day	1
alike.	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
be	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind.	1
	1
14:6	1
He	1
that	1
regardeth	1
the	1
day,	1
regardeth	1
it	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
regardeth	1
not	1
the	1
day,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
doth	1
not	1
regard	1
it.	1
He	1
that	1
eateth,	1
eateth	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
for	1
he	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
not,	1
to	1
the	1
Lord	1
he	1
eateth	1
not,	1
and	1
giveth	1
God	1
thanks.	1
	1
14:7	1
For	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
liveth	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
dieth	1
to	1
himself.	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
whether	1
we	1
live,	1
we	1
live	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
whether	1
we	1
die,	1
we	1
die	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord:	1
whether	1
we	1
live	1
therefore,	1
or	1
die,	1
we	1
are	1
the	1
Lord's.	1
	1
14:9	1
For	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
Christ	1
both	1
died,	1
and	1
rose,	1
and	1
revived,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
Lord	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
and	1
living.	1
	1
14:10	1
But	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
judge	1
thy	1
brother?	1
or	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
set	1
at	1
nought	1
thy	1
brother?	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
stand	1
before	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
14:11	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
As	1
I	1
live,	1
saith	1
the	1
Lord,	1
every	1
knee	1
shall	1
bow	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
every	1
tongue	1
shall	1
confess	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:12	1
So	1
then	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
shall	1
give	1
account	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:13	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
therefore	1
judge	1
one	1
another	1
any	1
more:	1
but	1
judge	1
this	1
rather,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
put	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
or	1
an	1
occasion	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
his	1
brother's	1
way.	1
	1
14:14	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
am	1
persuaded	1
by	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
unclean	1
of	1
itself:	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
esteemeth	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
unclean,	1
to	1
him	1
it	1
is	1
unclean.	1
	1
14:15	1
But	1
if	1
thy	1
brother	1
be	1
grieved	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
now	1
walkest	1
thou	1
not	1
charitably.	1
Destroy	1
not	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
meat,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died.	1
	1
14:16	1
Let	1
not	1
then	1
your	1
good	1
be	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of:	1
14:17	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
meat	1
and	1
drink;	1
but	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
peace,	1
and	1
joy	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
14:18	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
things	1
serveth	1
Christ	1
is	1
acceptable	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
approved	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
14:19	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
follow	1
after	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
make	1
for	1
peace,	1
and	1
things	1
wherewith	1
one	1
may	1
edify	1
another.	1
	1
14:20	1
For	1
meat	1
destroy	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
God.	1
All	1
things	1
indeed	1
are	1
pure;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evil	1
for	1
that	1
man	1
who	1
eateth	1
with	1
offence.	1
	1
14:21	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
neither	1
to	1
eat	1
flesh,	1
nor	1
to	1
drink	1
wine,	1
nor	1
any	1
thing	1
whereby	1
thy	1
brother	1
stumbleth,	1
or	1
is	1
offended,	1
or	1
is	1
made	1
weak.	1
	1
14:22	1
Hast	1
thou	1
faith?	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
thyself	1
before	1
God.	1
Happy	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
condemneth	1
not	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
thing	1
which	1
he	1
alloweth.	1
	1
14:23	1
And	1
he	1
that	1
doubteth	1
is	1
damned	1
if	1
he	1
eat,	1
because	1
he	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
faith:	1
for	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
faith	1
is	1
sin.	1
	1
15:1	1
We	1
then	1
that	1
are	1
strong	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
infirmities	1
of	1
the	1
weak,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
please	1
ourselves.	1
	1
15:2	1
Let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
please	1
his	1
neighbour	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
to	1
edification.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
pleased	1
not	1
himself;	1
but,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
reproaches	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
reproached	1
thee	1
fell	1
on	1
me.	1
	1
15:4	1
For	1
whatsoever	1
things	1
were	1
written	1
aforetime	1
were	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
learning,	1
that	1
we	1
through	1
patience	1
and	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
scriptures	1
might	1
have	1
hope.	1
	1
15:5	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
patience	1
and	1
consolation	1
grant	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
likeminded	1
one	1
toward	1
another	1
according	1
to	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
15:6	1
That	1
ye	1
may	1
with	1
one	1
mind	1
and	1
one	1
mouth	1
glorify	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:7	1
Wherefore	1
receive	1
ye	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
Christ	1
also	1
received	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:8	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
was	1
a	1
minister	1
of	1
the	1
circumcision	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
God,	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
promises	1
made	1
unto	1
the	1
fathers:	1
15:9	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
glorify	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
mercy;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
I	1
will	1
confess	1
to	1
thee	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
and	1
sing	1
unto	1
thy	1
name.	1
	1
15:10	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
saith,	1
Rejoice,	1
ye	1
Gentiles,	1
with	1
his	1
people.	1
	1
15:11	1
And	1
again,	1
Praise	1
the	1
Lord,	1
all	1
ye	1
Gentiles;	1
and	1
laud	1
him,	1
all	1
ye	1
people.	1
	1
15:12	1
And	1
again,	1
Esaias	1
saith,	1
There	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
root	1
of	1
Jesse,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
shall	1
rise	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
the	1
Gentiles;	1
in	1
him	1
shall	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
trust.	1
	1
15:13	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
hope	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
joy	1
and	1
peace	1
in	1
believing,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
hope,	1
through	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:14	1
And	1
I	1
myself	1
also	1
am	1
persuaded	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
also	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
goodness,	1
filled	1
with	1
all	1
knowledge,	1
able	1
also	1
to	1
admonish	1
one	1
another.	1
	1
15:15	1
Nevertheless,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
the	1
more	1
boldly	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
some	1
sort,	1
as	1
putting	1
you	1
in	1
mind,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
God,	1
15:16	1
That	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
minister	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
ministering	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
God,	1
that	1
the	1
offering	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
might	1
be	1
acceptable,	1
being	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
15:17	1
I	1
have	1
therefore	1
whereof	1
I	1
may	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
in	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
pertain	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
15:18	1
For	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
Christ	1
hath	1
not	1
wrought	1
by	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
obedient,	1
by	1
word	1
and	1
deed,	1
15:19	1
Through	1
mighty	1
signs	1
and	1
wonders,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God;	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
Jerusalem,	1
and	1
round	1
about	1
unto	1
Illyricum,	1
I	1
have	1
fully	1
preached	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:20	1
Yea,	1
so	1
have	1
I	1
strived	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
not	1
where	1
Christ	1
was	1
named,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
build	1
upon	1
another	1
man's	1
foundation:	1
15:21	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
spoken	1
of,	1
they	1
shall	1
see:	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
shall	1
understand.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
which	1
cause	1
also	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
hindered	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
now	1
having	1
no	1
more	1
place	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
these	1
many	1
years	1
to	1
come	1
unto	1
you;	1
15:24	1
Whensoever	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
journey	1
into	1
Spain,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
my	1
journey,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
thitherward	1
by	1
you,	1
if	1
first	1
I	1
be	1
somewhat	1
filled	1
with	1
your	1
company.	1
	1
15:25	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
go	1
unto	1
Jerusalem	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
15:26	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
of	1
Macedonia	1
and	1
Achaia	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
certain	1
contribution	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
Jerusalem.	1
	1
15:27	1
It	1
hath	1
pleased	1
them	1
verily;	1
and	1
their	1
debtors	1
they	1
are.	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
partakers	1
of	1
their	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
their	1
duty	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
minister	1
unto	1
them	1
in	1
carnal	1
things.	1
	1
15:28	1
When	1
therefore	1
I	1
have	1
performed	1
this,	1
and	1
have	1
sealed	1
to	1
them	1
this	1
fruit,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
by	1
you	1
into	1
Spain.	1
	1
15:29	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you,	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:30	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
for	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit,	1
that	1
ye	1
strive	1
together	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
prayers	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
me;	1
15:31	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
delivered	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
Judaea;	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
service	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
Jerusalem	1
may	1
be	1
accepted	1
of	1
the	1
saints;	1
15:32	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
joy	1
by	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
may	1
with	1
you	1
be	1
refreshed.	1
	1
15:33	1
Now	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:1	1
I	1
commend	1
unto	1
you	1
Phebe	1
our	1
sister,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Cenchrea:	1
16:2	1
That	1
ye	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
as	1
becometh	1
saints,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
assist	1
her	1
in	1
whatsoever	1
business	1
she	1
hath	1
need	1
of	1
you:	1
for	1
she	1
hath	1
been	1
a	1
succourer	1
of	1
many,	1
and	1
of	1
myself	1
also.	1
	1
16:3	1
Greet	1
Priscilla	1
and	1
Aquila	1
my	1
helpers	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus:	1
16:4	1
Who	1
have	1
for	1
my	1
life	1
laid	1
down	1
their	1
own	1
necks:	1
unto	1
whom	1
not	1
only	1
I	1
give	1
thanks,	1
but	1
also	1
all	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles.	1
	1
16:5	1
Likewise	1
greet	1
the	1
church	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
their	1
house.	1
Salute	1
my	1
well-beloved	1
Epaenetus,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
Achaia	1
unto	1
Christ.	1
	1
16:6	1
Greet	1
Mary,	1
who	1
bestowed	1
much	1
labour	1
on	1
us.	1
	1
16:7	1
Salute	1
Andronicus	1
and	1
Junia,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
and	1
my	1
fellow-prisoners,	1
who	1
are	1
of	1
note	1
among	1
the	1
apostles,	1
who	1
also	1
were	1
in	1
Christ	1
before	1
me.	1
	1
16:8	1
Greet	1
Amplias	1
my	1
beloved	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:9	1
Salute	1
Urbane,	1
our	1
helper	1
in	1
Christ,	1
and	1
Stachys	1
my	1
beloved.	1
	1
16:10	1
Salute	1
Apelles	1
approved	1
in	1
Christ.	1
Salute	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
Aristobulus'	1
household.	1
	1
16:11	1
Salute	1
Herodion	1

kinsman.	1
Greet	1

the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:12	1
Salute	1
Tryphena	1
and	1
Tryphosa,	1
who	1
labour	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
Salute	1
the	1

laboured	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:13	1
Salute	1
Rufus	1
chosen	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1

	1
16:14	1
Salute	1
Asyncritus,	1
Phlegon,	1
Hermas,	1

and	1
the	1

them.	1
	1
16:15	1
Salute	1
Philologus,	1

Julia,	1
Nereus,	1
and	1
his	1
sister,	1
and	1
Olympas,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
saints	1
which	1
are	1
with	1
them.	1
	1
16:16	1
Salute	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
an	1
holy	1
kiss.	1
The	1
churches	1
of	1
Christ	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:17	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
mark	1
them	1
which	1
cause	1
divisions	1
and	1
offences	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
learned;	1
and	1
avoid	1
them.	1
	1
16:18	1
For	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
such	1
serve	1
not	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
but	1
their	1
own	1
belly;	1
and	1
by	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
fair	1
speeches	1
deceive	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
simple.	1
	1
16:19	1
For	1
your	1
obedience	1
is	1
come	1
abroad	1
unto	1
all	1
men.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
therefore	1
on	1
your	1
behalf:	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
wise	1
unto	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good,	1
and	1
simple	1
concerning	1
evil.	1
	1
16:20	1
And	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
peace	1
shall	1
bruise	1
Satan	1
under	1
your	1
feet	1
shortly.	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:21	1
Timotheus	1
my	1
workfellow,	1
and	1
Lucius,	1
and	1
Jason,	1
and	1
Sosipater,	1
my	1
kinsmen,	1
salute	1
you.	1
	1
16:22	1
I	1
Tertius,	1
who	1
wrote	1
this	1
epistle,	1
salute	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:23	1
Gaius	1
mine	1
host,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
church,	1
saluteth	1
you.	1
Erastus	1
the	1
chamberlain	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
saluteth	1
you,	1
and	1
Quartus	1
a	1
brother.	1
	1
16:24	1
The	1
grace	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
all.	1
Amen.	1
	1
16:25	1
Now	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
stablish	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
gospel,	1
and	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
mystery,	1
which	1
was	1
kept	1
secret	1
since	1
the	1
world	1
began,	1
16:26	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
made	1
manifest,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
scriptures	1
of	1
the	1
prophets,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
everlasting	1
God,	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
nations	1
for	1
the	1
obedience	1
of	1
faith:	1
16:27	1
To	1
God	1
only	1
wise,	1
be	1
glory	1
through	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
for	1
ever.	1
Amen.	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
The	1
First	1
Epistle	1
of	1
Paul	1
the	1
Apostle	1
to	1
the	1
Corinthians	1
	1
	1
1:1	1
Paul	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
apostle	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
through	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
Sosthenes	1
our	1
brother,	1
1:2	1
Unto	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
Corinth,	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
sanctified	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
called	1
to	1
be	1
saints,	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
place	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord,	1
both	1
their's	1
and	1
our's:	1
1:3	1
Grace	1
be	1
unto	1
you,	1
and	1
peace,	1
from	1
God	1
our	1
Father,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:4	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God	1
always	1
on	1
your	1
behalf,	1
for	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
you	1
by	1
Jesus	1
Christ;	1
1:5	1
That	1
in	1
every	1
thing	1
ye	1
are	1
enriched	1
by	1
him,	1
in	1
all	1
utterance,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
1:6	1
Even	1
as	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Christ	1
was	1
confirmed	1
in	1
you:	1
1:7	1
So	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
behind	1
in	1
no	1
gift;	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ:	1
1:8	1
Who	1
shall	1
also	1
confirm	1
you	1
unto	1
the	1
end,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
blameless	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:9	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
were	1
called	1
unto	1
the	1
fellowship	1
of	1
his	1
Son	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord.	1
	1
1:10	1
Now	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
speak	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
but	1
that	1
ye	1
be	1
perfectly	1
joined	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mind	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
judgment.	1
	1
1:11	1
For	1
it	1
hath	1
been	1
declared	1
unto	1
me	1
of	1
you,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
by	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Chloe,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
contentions	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
1:12	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Cephas;	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
1:13	1
Is	1
Christ	1
divided?	1
was	1
Paul	1
crucified	1
for	1
you?	1
or	1
were	1
ye	1
baptized	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Paul?	1
	1
1:14	1
I	1
thank	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
baptized	1
none	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
Crispus	1
and	1
Gaius;	1
1:15	1
Lest	1
any	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
baptized	1
in	1
mine	1
own	1
name.	1
	1
1:16	1
And	1
I	1
baptized	1
also	1
the	1
household	1
of	1
Stephanas:	1
besides,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
I	1
baptized	1
any	1
other.	1
	1
1:17	1
For	1
Christ	1
sent	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
baptize,	1
but	1
to	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel:	1
not	1
with	1
wisdom	1
of	1
words,	1
lest	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
Christ	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
none	1
effect.	1
	1
1:18	1
For	1
the	1
preaching	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
is	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
perish	1
foolishness;	1
but	1
unto	1
us	1
which	1
are	1
saved	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:19	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
I	1
will	1
destroy	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
and	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
nothing	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
prudent.	1
	1
1:20	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
wise?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
scribe?	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
disputer	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
hath	1
not	1
God	1
made	1
foolish	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world?	1
	1
1:21	1
For	1
after	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
wisdom	1
knew	1
not	1
God,	1
it	1
pleased	1
God	1
by	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
preaching	1
to	1
save	1
them	1
that	1
believe.	1
	1
1:22	1
For	1
the	1
Jews	1
require	1
a	1
sign,	1
and	1
the	1
Greeks	1
seek	1
after	1
wisdom:	1
1:23	1
But	1
we	1
preach	1
Christ	1
crucified,	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
a	1
stumblingblock,	1
and	1
unto	1
the	1
Greeks	1
foolishness;	1
1:24	1
But	1
unto	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
called,	1
both	1
Jews	1
and	1
Greeks,	1
Christ	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
1:25	1
Because	1
the	1
foolishness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
wiser	1
than	1
men;	1
and	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
stronger	1
than	1
men.	1
	1
1:26	1
For	1
ye	1
see	1
your	1
calling,	1
brethren,	1
how	1
that	1
not	1
many	1
wise	1
men	1
after	1
the	1
flesh,	1
not	1
many	1
mighty,	1
not	1
many	1
noble,	1
are	1
called:	1
1:27	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
wise;	1
and	1
God	1
hath	1
chosen	1
the	1
weak	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
confound	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
mighty;	1
1:28	1
And	1
base	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
despised,	1
hath	1
God	1
chosen,	1
yea,	1
and	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
not,	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
nought	1
things	1
that	1
are:	1
1:29	1
That	1
no	1
flesh	1
should	1
glory	1
in	1
his	1
presence.	1
	1
1:30	1
But	1
of	1
him	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus,	1
who	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
made	1
unto	1
us	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sanctification,	1
and	1
redemption:	1
1:31	1
That,	1
according	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
that	1
glorieth,	1
let	1
him	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
2:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you,	1
came	1
not	1
with	1
excellency	1
of	1
speech	1
or	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
declaring	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:2	1
For	1
I	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
any	1
thing	1
among	1
you,	1
save	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
and	1
him	1
crucified.	1
	1
2:3	1
And	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
weakness,	1
and	1
in	1
fear,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
trembling.	1
	1
2:4	1
And	1
my	1
speech	1
and	1
my	1
preaching	1
was	1
not	1
with	1
enticing	1
words	1
of	1
man's	1
wisdom,	1
but	1
in	1
demonstration	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
and	1
of	1
power:	1
2:5	1
That	1
your	1
faith	1
should	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:6	1
Howbeit	1
we	1
speak	1
wisdom	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
perfect:	1
yet	1
not	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
nought:	1
2:7	1
But	1
we	1
speak	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
God	1
in	1
a	1
mystery,	1
even	1
the	1
hidden	1
wisdom,	1
which	1
God	1
ordained	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
unto	1
our	1
glory:	1
2:8	1
Which	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
princes	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
knew:	1
for	1
had	1
they	1
known	1
it,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
crucified	1
the	1
Lord	1
of	1
glory.	1
	1
2:9	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
Eye	1
hath	1
not	1
seen,	1
nor	1
ear	1
heard,	1
neither	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man,	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
God	1
hath	1
prepared	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
love	1
him.	1
	1
2:10	1
But	1
God	1
hath	1
revealed	1
them	1
unto	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
Spirit:	1
for	1
the	1
Spirit	1
searcheth	1
all	1
things,	1
yea,	1
the	1
deep	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:11	1
For	1
what	1
man	1
knoweth	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
save	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
man	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
him?	1
even	1
so	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
God	1
knoweth	1
no	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:12	1
Now	1
we	1
have	1
received,	1
not	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
God;	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
know	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
freely	1
given	1
to	1
us	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
2:13	1
Which	1
things	1
also	1
we	1
speak,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
which	1
man's	1
wisdom	1
teacheth,	1
but	1
which	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
teacheth;	1
comparing	1
spiritual	1
things	1
with	1
spiritual.	1
	1
2:14	1
But	1
the	1
natural	1
man	1
receiveth	1
not	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God:	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
foolishness	1
unto	1
him:	1
neither	1
can	1
he	1
know	1
them,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
spiritually	1
discerned.	1
	1
2:15	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
spiritual	1
judgeth	1
all	1
things,	1
yet	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
no	1
man.	1
	1
2:16	1
For	1
who	1
hath	1
known	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
instruct	1
him?	1
	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:1	1
And	1
I,	1
brethren,	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
unto	1
you	1
as	1
unto	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
as	1
unto	1
carnal,	1
even	1
as	1
unto	1
babes	1
in	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:2	1
I	1
have	1
fed	1
you	1
with	1
milk,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
meat:	1
for	1
hitherto	1
ye	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it,	1
neither	1
yet	1
now	1
are	1
ye	1
able.	1
	1
3:3	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
carnal:	1
for	1
whereas	1
there	1
is	1
among	1
you	1
envying,	1
and	1
strife,	1
and	1
divisions,	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal,	1
and	1
walk	1
as	1
men?	1
	1
3:4	1
For	1
while	1
one	1
saith,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Paul;	1
and	1
another,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
Apollos;	1
are	1
ye	1
not	1
carnal?	1
	1
3:5	1
Who	1
then	1
is	1
Paul,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
Apollos,	1
but	1
ministers	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
believed,	1
even	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
gave	1
to	1
every	1
man?	1
	1
3:6	1
I	1
have	1
planted,	1
Apollos	1
watered;	1
but	1
God	1
gave	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:7	1
So	1
then	1
neither	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
any	1
thing,	1
neither	1
he	1
that	1
watereth;	1
but	1
God	1
that	1
giveth	1
the	1
increase.	1
	1
3:8	1
Now	1
he	1
that	1
planteth	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watereth	1
are	1
one:	1
and	1
every	1
man	1
shall	1
receive	1
his	1
own	1
reward	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
labour.	1
	1
3:9	1
For	1
we	1
are	1
labourers	1
together	1
with	1
God:	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
husbandry,	1
ye	1
are	1
God's	1
building.	1
	1
3:10	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
is	1
given	1
unto	1
me,	1
as	1
a	1
wise	1
masterbuilder,	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation,	1
and	1
another	1
buildeth	1
thereon.	1
But	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
take	1
heed	1
how	1
he	1
buildeth	1
thereupon.	1
	1
3:11	1
For	1
other	1
foundation	1
can	1
no	1
man	1
lay	1
than	1
that	1
is	1
laid,	1
which	1
is	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
3:12	1
Now	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
build	1
upon	1
this	1
foundation	1
gold,	1
silver,	1
precious	1
stones,	1
wood,	1
hay,	1
stubble;	1
3:13	1
Every	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
manifest:	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
shall	1
declare	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
revealed	1
by	1
fire;	1
and	1
the	1
fire	1
shall	1
try	1
every	1
man's	1
work	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
it	1
is.	1
	1
3:14	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
abide	1
which	1
he	1
hath	1
built	1
thereupon,	1
he	1
shall	1
receive	1
a	1
reward.	1
	1
3:15	1
If	1
any	1
man's	1
work	1
shall	1
be	1
burned,	1
he	1
shall	1
suffer	1
loss:	1
but	1
he	1
himself	1
shall	1
be	1
saved;	1
yet	1
so	1
as	1
by	1
fire.	1
	1
3:16	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
dwelleth	1
in	1
you?	1
	1
3:17	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
defile	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God,	1
him	1
shall	1
God	1
destroy;	1
for	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
holy,	1
which	1
temple	1
ye	1
are.	1
	1
3:18	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
deceive	1
himself.	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
among	1
you	1
seemeth	1
to	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
let	1
him	1
become	1
a	1
fool,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
wise.	1
	1
3:19	1
For	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
foolishness	1
with	1
God.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
He	1
taketh	1
the	1
wise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
craftiness.	1
	1
3:20	1
And	1
again,	1
The	1
Lord	1
knoweth	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
wise,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
vain.	1
	1
3:21	1
Therefore	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
glory	1
in	1
men.	1
For	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:22	1
Whether	1
Paul,	1
or	1
Apollos,	1
or	1
Cephas,	1
or	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
life,	1
or	1
death,	1
or	1
things	1
present,	1
or	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
all	1
are	1
your's;	1
3:23	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
Christ's;	1
and	1
Christ	1
is	1
God's.	1
	1
4:1	1
Let	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
account	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
stewards	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:2	1
Moreover	1
it	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
stewards,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
be	1
found	1
faithful.	1
	1
4:3	1
But	1
with	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
you,	1
or	1
of	1
man's	1
judgment:	1
yea,	1
I	1
judge	1
not	1
mine	1
own	1
self.	1
	1
4:4	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
by	1
myself;	1
yet	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
hereby	1
justified:	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
judgeth	1
me	1
is	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
4:5	1
Therefore	1
judge	1
nothing	1
before	1
the	1
time,	1
until	1
the	1
Lord	1
come,	1
who	1
both	1
will	1
bring	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
hidden	1
things	1
of	1
darkness,	1
and	1
will	1
make	1
manifest	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
hearts:	1
and	1
then	1
shall	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
praise	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
4:6	1
And	1
these	1
things,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
figure	1
transferred	1
to	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
Apollos	1
for	1
your	1
sakes;	1
that	1
ye	1
might	1
learn	1
in	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
men	1
above	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
written,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
puffed	1
up	1
for	1
one	1
against	1
another.	1
	1
4:7	1
For	1
who	1
maketh	1
thee	1
to	1
differ	1
from	1
another?	1
and	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
not	1
receive?	1
now	1
if	1
thou	1
didst	1
receive	1
it,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
glory,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
received	1
it?	1
	1
4:8	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
full,	1
now	1
ye	1
are	1
rich,	1
ye	1
have	1
reigned	1
as	1
kings	1
without	1
us:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
to	1
God	1
ye	1
did	1
reign,	1
that	1
we	1
also	1
might	1
reign	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
4:9	1
For	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
forth	1
us	1
the	1
apostles	1
last,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
appointed	1
to	1
death:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
a	1
spectacle	1
unto	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to	1
angels,	1
and	1
to	1
men.	1
	1
4:10	1
We	1
are	1
fools	1
for	1
Christ's	1
sake,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
wise	1
in	1
Christ;	1
we	1
are	1
weak,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
strong;	1
ye	1
are	1
honourable,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
despised.	1
	1
4:11	1
Even	1
unto	1
this	1
present	1
hour	1
we	1
both	1
hunger,	1
and	1
thirst,	1
and	1
are	1
naked,	1
and	1
are	1
buffeted,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
certain	1
dwellingplace;	1
4:12	1
And	1
labour,	1
working	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
hands:	1
being	1
reviled,	1
we	1
bless;	1
being	1
persecuted,	1
we	1
suffer	1
it:	1
4:13	1
Being	1
defamed,	1
we	1
intreat:	1
we	1
are	1
made	1
as	1
the	1
filth	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
are	1
the	1
offscouring	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
unto	1
this	1
day.	1
	1
4:14	1
I	1
write	1
not	1
these	1
things	1
to	1
shame	1
you,	1
but	1
as	1
my	1
beloved	1
sons	1
I	1
warn	1
you.	1
	1
4:15	1
For	1
though	1
ye	1
have	1
ten	1
thousand	1
instructers	1
in	1
Christ,	1
yet	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
many	1
fathers:	1
for	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
I	1
have	1
begotten	1
you	1
through	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
4:16	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
4:17	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
have	1
I	1
sent	1
unto	1
you	1
Timotheus,	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
beloved	1
son,	1
and	1
faithful	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
who	1
shall	1
bring	1
you	1
into	1
remembrance	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
which	1
be	1
in	1
Christ,	1
as	1
I	1
teach	1
every	1
where	1
in	1
every	1
church.	1
	1
4:18	1
Now	1
some	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
4:19	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
shortly,	1
if	1
the	1
Lord	1
will,	1
and	1
will	1
know,	1
not	1
the	1
speech	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
but	1
the	1
power.	1
	1
4:20	1
For	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
word,	1
but	1
in	1
power.	1
	1
4:21	1
What	1
will	1
ye?	1
shall	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
with	1
a	1
rod,	1
or	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
meekness?	1
	1
5:1	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
commonly	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
fornication	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
such	1
fornication	1
as	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
named	1
among	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
that	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
his	1
father's	1
wife.	1
	1
5:2	1
And	1
ye	1
are	1
puffed	1
up,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
rather	1
mourned,	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
hath	1
done	1
this	1
deed	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
5:3	1
For	1
I	1
verily,	1
as	1
absent	1
in	1
body,	1
but	1
present	1
in	1
spirit,	1
have	1
judged	1
already,	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
present,	1
concerning	1
him	1
that	1
hath	1
so	1
done	1
this	1
deed,	1
5:4	1
In	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
when	1
ye	1
are	1
gathered	1
together,	1
and	1
my	1
spirit,	1
with	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
5:5	1
To	1
deliver	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
unto	1
Satan	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
flesh,	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
may	1
be	1
saved	1
in	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus.	1
	1
5:6	1
Your	1
glorying	1
is	1
not	1
good.	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
leaven	1
leaveneth	1
the	1
whole	1
lump?	1
	1
5:7	1
Purge	1
out	1
therefore	1
the	1
old	1
leaven,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
lump,	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
unleavened.	1
For	1
even	1
Christ	1
our	1
passover	1
is	1
sacrificed	1
for	1
us:	1
5:8	1
Therefore	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
the	1
feast,	1
not	1
with	1
old	1
leaven,	1
neither	1
with	1
the	1
leaven	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
wickedness;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
unleavened	1
bread	1
of	1
sincerity	1
and	1
truth.	1
	1
5:9	1
I	1
wrote	1
unto	1
you	1
in	1
an	1
epistle	1
not	1
to	1
company	1
with	1
fornicators:	1
5:10	1
Yet	1
not	1
altogether	1
with	1
the	1
fornicators	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
covetous,	1
or	1
extortioners,	1
or	1
with	1
idolaters;	1
for	1
then	1
must	1
ye	1
needs	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
5:11	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
unto	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
company,	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
brother	1
be	1
a	1
fornicator,	1
or	1
covetous,	1
or	1
an	1
idolater,	1
or	1
a	1
railer,	1
or	1
a	1
drunkard,	1
or	1
an	1
extortioner;	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
no	1
not	1
to	1
eat.	1
	1
5:12	1
For	1
what	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
judge	1
them	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
without?	1
do	1
not	1
ye	1
judge	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
within?	1
	1
5:13	1
But	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
God	1
judgeth.	1
Therefore	1
put	1
away	1
from	1
among	1
yourselves	1
that	1
wicked	1
person.	1
	1
6:1	1
Dare	1
any	1
of	1
you,	1
having	1
a	1
matter	1
against	1
another,	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
before	1
the	1
unjust,	1
and	1
not	1
before	1
the	1
saints?	1
	1
6:2	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
saints	1
shall	1
judge	1
the	1
world?	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
you,	1
are	1
ye	1
unworthy	1
to	1
judge	1
the	1
smallest	1
matters?	1
	1
6:3	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
judge	1
angels?	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
things	1
that	1
pertain	1
to	1
this	1
life?	1
6:4	1
If	1
then	1
ye	1
have	1
judgments	1
of	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
this	1
life,	1
set	1
them	1
to	1
judge	1
who	1
are	1
least	1
esteemed	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
6:5	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
Is	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
among	1
you?	1
no,	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
judge	1
between	1
his	1
brethren?	1
	1
6:6	1
But	1
brother	1
goeth	1
to	1
law	1
with	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
unbelievers.	1
	1
6:7	1
Now	1
therefore	1
there	1
is	1
utterly	1
a	1
fault	1
among	1
you,	1
because	1
ye	1
go	1
to	1
law	1
one	1
with	1
another.	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
take	1
wrong?	1
why	1
do	1
ye	1
not	1
rather	1
suffer	1
yourselves	1
to	1
be	1
defrauded?	1
	1
6:8	1
Nay,	1
ye	1
do	1
wrong,	1
and	1
defraud,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
brethren.	1
	1
6:9	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
unrighteous	1
shall	1
not	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God?	1
	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
neither	1
fornicators,	1
nor	1
idolaters,	1
nor	1
adulterers,	1
nor	1
effeminate,	1
nor	1
abusers	1
of	1
themselves	1
with	1
mankind,	1
6:10	1
Nor	1
thieves,	1
nor	1
covetous,	1
nor	1
drunkards,	1
nor	1
revilers,	1
nor	1
extortioners,	1
shall	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
6:11	1
And	1
such	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
you:	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
washed,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
sanctified,	1
but	1
ye	1
are	1
justified	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
our	1
God.	1
	1
6:12	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
unto	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
brought	1
under	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any.	1
	1
6:13	1
Meats	1
for	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
the	1
belly	1
for	1
meats:	1
but	1
God	1
shall	1
destroy	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
them.	1
Now	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
fornication,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
Lord;	1
and	1
the	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
body.	1
	1
6:14	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
both	1
raised	1
up	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
will	1
also	1
raise	1
up	1
us	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
power.	1
	1
6:15	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
bodies	1
are	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ?	1
shall	1
I	1
then	1
take	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
an	1
harlot?	1
God	1
forbid.	1
	1
6:16	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
which	1
is	1
joined	1
to	1
an	1
harlot	1
is	1
one	1
body?	1
	1
for	1
two,	1
saith	1
he,	1
shall	1
be	1
one	1
flesh.	1
	1
6:17	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
joined	1
unto	1
the	1
Lord	1
is	1
one	1
spirit.	1
	1
6:18	1
Flee	1
fornication.	1
Every	1
sin	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
doeth	1
is	1
without	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
committeth	1
fornication	1
sinneth	1
against	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
6:19	1
What?	1
know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
your	1
body	1
is	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
you,	1
which	1
ye	1
have	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
ye	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own?	1
	1
6:20	1
For	1
ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price:	1
therefore	1
glorify	1
God	1
in	1
your	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
spirit,	1
which	1
are	1
God's.	1
	1
7:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
things	1
whereof	1
ye	1
wrote	1
unto	1
me:	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
woman.	1
	1
7:2	1
Nevertheless,	1
to	1
avoid	1
fornication,	1
let	1
every	1
man	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
woman	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
husband.	1
	1
7:3	1
Let	1
the	1
husband	1
render	1
unto	1
the	1
wife	1
due	1
benevolence:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
wife	1
unto	1
the	1
husband.	1
	1
7:4	1
The	1
wife	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
husband:	1
and	1
likewise	1
also	1
the	1
husband	1
hath	1
not	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
wife.	1
	1
7:5	1
Defraud	1
ye	1
not	1
one	1
the	1
other,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
consent	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
give	1
yourselves	1
to	1
fasting	1
and	1
prayer;	1
and	1
come	1
together	1
again,	1
that	1
Satan	1
tempt	1
you	1
not	1
for	1
your	1
incontinency.	1
	1
7:6	1
But	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
by	1
permission,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
commandment.	1
	1
7:7	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
were	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
myself.	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
his	1
proper	1
gift	1
of	1
God,	1
one	1
after	1
this	1
manner,	1
and	1
another	1
after	1
that.	1
	1
7:8	1
I	1
say	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
unmarried	1
and	1
widows,	1
It	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
abide	1
even	1
as	1
I.	1
	1
7:9	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
contain,	1
let	1
them	1
marry:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
marry	1
than	1
to	1
burn.	1
	1
7:10	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
married	1
I	1
command,	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
Lord,	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
wife	1
depart	1
from	1
her	1
husband:	1
7:11	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
depart,	1
let	1
her	1
remain	1
unmarried	1
or	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
her	1
husband:	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
the	1
husband	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:12	1
But	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
speak	1
I,	1
not	1
the	1
Lord:	1
If	1
any	1
brother	1
hath	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
she	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
put	1
her	1
away.	1
	1
7:13	1
And	1
the	1
woman	1
which	1
hath	1
an	1
husband	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
dwell	1
with	1
her,	1
let	1
her	1
not	1
leave	1
him.	1
	1
7:14	1
For	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
husband	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
wife,	1
and	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
wife	1
is	1
sanctified	1
by	1
the	1
husband:	1
else	1
were	1
your	1
children	1
unclean;	1
but	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
holy.	1
	1
7:15	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
unbelieving	1
depart,	1
let	1
him	1
depart.	1
A	1
brother	1
or	1
a	1
sister	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
bondage	1
in	1
such	1
cases:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
called	1
us	1
to	1
peace.	1
	1
7:16	1
For	1
what	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
wife,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
husband?	1
	1
or	1
how	1
knowest	1
thou,	1
O	1
man,	1
whether	1
thou	1
shalt	1
save	1
thy	1
wife?	1
	1
7:17	1
But	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
distributed	1
to	1
every	1
man,	1
as	1
the	1
Lord	1
hath	1
called	1
every	1
one,	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
walk.	1
And	1
so	1
ordain	1
I	1
in	1
all	1
churches.	1
	1
7:18	1
Is	1
any	1
man	1
called	1
being	1
circumcised?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
become	1
uncircumcised.	1
Is	1
any	1
called	1
in	1
uncircumcision?	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
circumcised.	1
	1
7:19	1
Circumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
and	1
uncircumcision	1
is	1
nothing,	1
but	1
the	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
7:20	1
Let	1
every	1
man	1
abide	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
calling	1
wherein	1
he	1
was	1
called.	1
	1
7:21	1
Art	1
thou	1
called	1
being	1
a	1
servant?	1
care	1
not	1
for	1
it:	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
made	1
free,	1
use	1
it	1
rather.	1
	1
7:22	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
Lord,	1
being	1
a	1
servant,	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's	1
freeman:	1
likewise	1
also	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
called,	1
being	1
free,	1
is	1
Christ's	1
servant.	1
	1
7:23	1
Ye	1
are	1
bought	1
with	1
a	1
price;	1
be	1
not	1
ye	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
men.	1
	1
7:24	1
Brethren,	1
let	1
every	1
man,	1
wherein	1
he	1
is	1
called,	1
therein	1
abide	1
with	1
God.	1
	1
7:25	1
Now	1
concerning	1
virgins	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
commandment	1
of	1
the	1
Lord:	1
yet	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
judgment,	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
hath	1
obtained	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
be	1
faithful.	1
	1
7:26	1
I	1
suppose	1
therefore	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
distress,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
to	1
be.	1
	1
7:27	1
Art	1
thou	1
bound	1
unto	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
loosed.	1
Art	1
thou	1
loosed	1
from	1
a	1
wife?	1
seek	1
not	1
a	1
wife.	1
	1
7:28	1
But	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
marry,	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
sinned;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
virgin	1
marry,	1
she	1
hath	1
not	1
sinned.	1
Nevertheless	1
such	1
shall	1
have	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
flesh:	1
but	1
I	1
spare	1
you.	1
	1
7:29	1
But	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
the	1
time	1
is	1
short:	1
it	1
remaineth,	1
that	1
both	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
wives	1
be	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
none;	1
7:30	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
weep,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
wept	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
rejoice,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
rejoiced	1
not;	1
and	1
they	1
that	1
buy,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
possessed	1
not;	1
7:31	1
And	1
they	1
that	1
use	1
this	1
world,	1
as	1
not	1
abusing	1
it:	1
for	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
passeth	1
away.	1
	1
7:32	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
without	1
carefulness.	1
He	1
that	1
is	1
unmarried	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Lord,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
the	1
Lord:	1
7:33	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
please	1
his	1
wife.	1
	1
7:34	1
There	1
is	1
difference	1
also	1
between	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
virgin.	1
The	1
unmarried	1
woman	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
holy	1
both	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
spirit:	1
but	1
she	1
that	1
is	1
married	1
careth	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
how	1
she	1
may	1
please	1
her	1
husband.	1
	1
7:35	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
speak	1
for	1
your	1
own	1
profit;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
snare	1
upon	1
you,	1
but	1
for	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
comely,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
attend	1
upon	1
the	1
Lord	1
without	1
distraction.	1
	1
7:36	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
behaveth	1
himself	1
uncomely	1
toward	1
his	1
virgin,	1
if	1
she	1
pass	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
her	1
age,	1
and	1
need	1
so	1
require,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
he	1
sinneth	1
not:	1
let	1
them	1
marry.	1
	1
7:37	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
that	1
standeth	1
stedfast	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
having	1
no	1
necessity,	1
but	1
hath	1
power	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
will,	1
and	1
hath	1
so	1
decreed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
virgin,	1
doeth	1
well.	1
	1
7:38	1
So	1
then	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
well;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
giveth	1
her	1
not	1
in	1
marriage	1
doeth	1
better.	1
	1
7:39	1
The	1
wife	1
is	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
liveth;	1
but	1
if	1
her	1
husband	1
be	1
dead,	1
she	1
is	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
will;	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
7:40	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
happier	1
if	1
she	1
so	1
abide,	1
after	1
my	1
judgment:	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
also	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
8:1	1
Now	1
as	1
touching	1
things	1
offered	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
have	1
knowledge.	1
Knowledge	1
puffeth	1
up,	1
but	1
charity	1
edifieth.	1
	1
8:2	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
knoweth	1
any	1
thing,	1
he	1
knoweth	1
nothing	1
yet	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
know.	1
	1
8:3	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
love	1
God,	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
him.	1
	1
8:4	1
As	1
concerning	1
therefore	1
the	1
eating	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
an	1
idol	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
God	1
but	1
one.	1
	1
8:5	1
For	1
though	1
there	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
gods,	1
whether	1
in	1
heaven	1
or	1
in	1
earth,	1
(as	1
there	1
be	1
gods	1
many,	1
and	1
lords	1
many,)	1
8:6	1
But	1
to	1
us	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
God,	1
the	1
Father,	1
of	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
in	1
him;	1
and	1
one	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
by	1
whom	1
are	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
we	1
by	1
him.	1
	1
8:7	1
Howbeit	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
knowledge:	1
for	1
some	1
with	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
idol	1
unto	1
this	1
hour	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
offered	1
unto	1
an	1
idol;	1
and	1
their	1
conscience	1
being	1
weak	1
is	1
defiled.	1
	1
8:8	1
But	1
meat	1
commendeth	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
for	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
better;	1
neither,	1
if	1
we	1
eat	1
not,	1
are	1
we	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
8:9	1
But	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
this	1
liberty	1
of	1
your's	1
become	1
a	1
stumblingblock	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
weak.	1
	1
8:10	1
For	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
see	1
thee	1
which	1
hast	1
knowledge	1
sit	1
at	1
meat	1
in	1
the	1
idol's	1
temple,	1
shall	1
not	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
him	1
which	1
is	1
weak	1
be	1
emboldened	1
to	1
eat	1
those	1
things	1
which	1
are	1
offered	1
to	1
idols;	1
8:11	1
And	1
through	1
thy	1
knowledge	1
shall	1
the	1
weak	1
brother	1
perish,	1
for	1
whom	1
Christ	1
died?	1
	1
8:12	1
But	1
when	1
ye	1
sin	1
so	1
against	1
the	1
brethren,	1
and	1
wound	1
their	1
weak	1
conscience,	1
ye	1
sin	1
against	1
Christ.	1
	1
8:13	1
Wherefore,	1
if	1
meat	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend,	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
no	1
flesh	1
while	1
the	1
world	1
standeth,	1
lest	1
I	1
make	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
offend.	1
	1
9:1	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
an	1
apostle?	1
am	1
I	1
not	1
free?	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
our	1
Lord?	1
are	1
not	1
ye	1
my	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
Lord?	1
	1
9:2	1
If	1
I	1
be	1
not	1
an	1
apostle	1
unto	1
others,	1
yet	1
doubtless	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
you:	1
for	1
the	1
seal	1
of	1
mine	1
apostleship	1
are	1
ye	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
9:3	1
Mine	1
answer	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
do	1
examine	1
me	1
is	1
this,	1
9:4	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink?	1
	1
9:5	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
lead	1
about	1
a	1
sister,	1
a	1
wife,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
other	1
apostles,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
brethren	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
Cephas?	1
	1
9:6	1
Or	1
I	1
only	1
and	1
Barnabas,	1
have	1
not	1
we	1
power	1
to	1
forbear	1
working?	1
	1
9:7	1
Who	1
goeth	1
a	1
warfare	1
any	1
time	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
charges?	1
who	1
planteth	1
a	1
vineyard,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
fruit	1
thereof?	1
or	1
who	1
feedeth	1
a	1
flock,	1
and	1
eateth	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
milk	1
of	1
the	1
flock?	1
	1
9:8	1
Say	1
I	1
these	1
things	1
as	1
a	1
man?	1
or	1
saith	1
not	1
the	1
law	1
the	1
same	1
also?	1
	1
9:9	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
Moses,	1
Thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
muzzle	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
that	1
treadeth	1
out	1
the	1
corn.	1
Doth	1
God	1
take	1
care	1
for	1
oxen?	1
	1
9:10	1
Or	1
saith	1
he	1
it	1
altogether	1
for	1
our	1
sakes?	1
For	1
our	1
sakes,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
this	1
is	1
written:	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
ploweth	1
should	1
plow	1
in	1
hope;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
that	1
thresheth	1
in	1
hope	1
should	1
be	1
partaker	1
of	1
his	1
hope.	1
	1
9:11	1
If	1
we	1
have	1
sown	1
unto	1
you	1
spiritual	1
things,	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
great	1
thing	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
reap	1
your	1
carnal	1
things?	1
	1
9:12	1
If	1
others	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
over	1
you,	1
are	1
not	1
we	1
rather?	1
	1
Nevertheless	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
used	1
this	1
power;	1
but	1
suffer	1
all	1
things,	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
hinder	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
9:13	1
Do	1
ye	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
minister	1
about	1
holy	1
things	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
temple?	1
and	1
they	1
which	1
wait	1
at	1
the	1
altar	1
are	1
partakers	1
with	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
9:14	1
Even	1
so	1
hath	1
the	1
Lord	1
ordained	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel	1
should	1
live	1
of	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:15	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things:	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
written	1
these	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
done	1
unto	1
me:	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
die,	1
than	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
make	1
my	1
glorying	1
void.	1
	1
9:16	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
glory	1
of:	1
for	1
necessity	1
is	1
laid	1
upon	1
me;	1
yea,	1
woe	1
is	1
unto	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
preach	1
not	1
the	1
gospel!	1
	1
9:17	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
thing	1
willingly,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
reward:	1
but	1
if	1
against	1
my	1
will,	1
a	1
dispensation	1
of	1
the	1
gospel	1
is	1
committed	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
9:18	1
What	1
is	1
my	1
reward	1
then?	1
Verily	1
that,	1
when	1
I	1
preach	1
the	1
gospel,	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
the	1
gospel	1
of	1
Christ	1
without	1
charge,	1
that	1
I	1
abuse	1
not	1
my	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
gospel.	1
	1
9:19	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
men,	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
made	1
myself	1
servant	1
unto	1
all,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
more.	1
	1
9:20	1
And	1
unto	1
the	1
Jews	1
I	1
became	1
as	1
a	1
Jew,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
Jews;	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
law,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
law;	1
9:21	1
To	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law,	1
as	1
without	1
law,	1
(being	1
not	1
without	1
law	1
to	1
God,	1
but	1
under	1
the	1
law	1
to	1
Christ,)	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
them	1
that	1
are	1
without	1
law.	1
	1
9:22	1
To	1
the	1
weak	1
became	1
I	1
as	1
weak,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
gain	1
the	1
weak:	1
I	1
am	1
made	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
all	1
men,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
save	1
some.	1
	1
9:23	1
And	1
this	1
I	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
gospel's	1
sake,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
be	1
partaker	1
thereof	1
with	1
you.	1
	1
9:24	1
Know	1
ye	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
run	1
in	1
a	1
race	1
run	1
all,	1
but	1
one	1
receiveth	1
the	1
prize?	1
So	1
run,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
obtain.	1
	1
9:25	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
striveth	1
for	1
the	1
mastery	1
is	1
temperate	1
in	1
all	1
things.	1
Now	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
corruptible	1
crown;	1
but	1
we	1
an	1
incorruptible.	1
	1
9:26	1
I	1
therefore	1
so	1
run,	1
not	1
as	1
uncertainly;	1
so	1
fight	1
I,	1
not	1
as	1
one	1
that	1
beateth	1
the	1
air:	1
9:27	1
But	1
I	1
keep	1
under	1
my	1
body,	1
and	1
bring	1
it	1
into	1
subjection:	1
lest	1
that	1
by	1
any	1
means,	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
preached	1
to	1
others,	1
I	1
myself	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
castaway.	1
	1
10:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
how	1
that	1
all	1
our	1
fathers	1
were	1
under	1
the	1
cloud,	1
and	1
all	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:2	1
And	1
were	1
all	1
baptized	1
unto	1
Moses	1
in	1
the	1
cloud	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
10:3	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
eat	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
meat;	1
10:4	1
And	1
did	1
all	1
drink	1
the	1
same	1
spiritual	1
drink:	1
for	1
they	1
drank	1
of	1
that	1
spiritual	1
Rock	1
that	1
followed	1
them:	1
and	1
that	1
Rock	1
was	1
Christ.	1
	1
10:5	1
But	1
with	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
God	1
was	1
not	1
well	1
pleased:	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
overthrown	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness.	1
	1
10:6	1
Now	1
these	1
things	1
were	1
our	1
examples,	1
to	1
the	1
intent	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
lust	1
after	1
evil	1
things,	1
as	1
they	1
also	1
lusted.	1
	1
10:7	1
Neither	1
be	1
ye	1
idolaters,	1
as	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
them;	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
people	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
drink,	1
and	1
rose	1
up	1
to	1
play.	1
	1
10:8	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
commit	1
fornication,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
committed,	1
and	1
fell	1
in	1
one	1
day	1
three	1
and	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
	1
10:9	1
Neither	1
let	1
us	1
tempt	1
Christ,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
tempted,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
serpents.	1
	1
10:10	1
Neither	1
murmur	1
ye,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
murmured,	1
and	1
were	1
destroyed	1
of	1
the	1
destroyer.	1
	1
10:11	1
Now	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
happened	1
unto	1
them	1
for	1
ensamples:	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
written	1
for	1
our	1
admonition,	1
upon	1
whom	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
come.	1
	1
10:12	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
thinketh	1
he	1
standeth	1
take	1
heed	1
lest	1
he	1
fall.	1
	1
10:13	1
There	1
hath	1
no	1
temptation	1
taken	1
you	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
is	1
common	1
to	1
man:	1
but	1
God	1
is	1
faithful,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
tempted	1
above	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
able;	1
but	1
will	1
with	1
the	1
temptation	1
also	1
make	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
escape,	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
it.	1
	1
10:14	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved,	1
flee	1
from	1
idolatry.	1
	1
10:15	1
I	1
speak	1
as	1
to	1
wise	1
men;	1
judge	1
ye	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
	1
10:16	1
The	1
cup	1
of	1
blessing	1
which	1
we	1
bless,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
Christ?	1
The	1
bread	1
which	1
we	1
break,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
communion	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ?	1
	1
10:17	1
For	1
we	1
being	1
many	1
are	1
one	1
bread,	1
and	1
one	1
body:	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
partakers	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
bread.	1
	1
10:18	1
Behold	1
Israel	1
after	1
the	1
flesh:	1
are	1
not	1
they	1
which	1
eat	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifices	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
altar?	1
	1
10:19	1
What	1
say	1
I	1
then?	1
that	1
the	1
idol	1
is	1
any	1
thing,	1
or	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
idols	1
is	1
any	1
thing?	1
	1
10:20	1
But	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
which	1
the	1
Gentiles	1
sacrifice,	1
they	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
devils,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
God:	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
ye	1
should	1
have	1
fellowship	1
with	1
devils.	1
	1
10:21	1
Ye	1
cannot	1
drink	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
and	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
devils:	1
ye	1
cannot	1
be	1
partakers	1
of	1
the	1
Lord's	1
table,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
of	1
devils.	1
	1
10:22	1
Do	1
we	1
provoke	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
jealousy?	1
are	1
we	1
stronger	1
than	1
he?	1
10:23	1
All	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
expedient:	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
lawful	1
for	1
me,	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
edify	1
not.	1
	1
10:24	1
Let	1
no	1
man	1
seek	1
his	1
own,	1
but	1
every	1
man	1
another's	1
wealth.	1
	1
10:25	1
Whatsoever	1
is	1
sold	1
in	1
the	1
shambles,	1
that	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
10:26	1
For	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof.	1
	1
10:27	1
If	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not	1
bid	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
feast,	1
and	1
ye	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
go;	1
whatsoever	1
is	1
set	1
before	1
you,	1
eat,	1
asking	1
no	1
question	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake.	1
	1
10:28	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
say	1
unto	1
you,	1
This	1
is	1
offered	1
in	1
sacrifice	1
unto	1
idols,	1
eat	1
not	1
for	1
his	1
sake	1
that	1
shewed	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
conscience	1
sake:	1
for	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
the	1
Lord's,	1
and	1
the	1
fulness	1
thereof:	1
10:29	1
Conscience,	1
I	1
say,	1
not	1
thine	1
own,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
other:	1
for	1
why	1
is	1
my	1
liberty	1
judged	1
of	1
another	1
man's	1
conscience?	1
	1
10:30	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
by	1
grace	1
be	1
a	1
partaker,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
evil	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
thanks?	1
	1
10:31	1
Whether	1
therefore	1
ye	1
eat,	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
whatsoever	1
ye	1
do,	1
do	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
10:32	1
Give	1
none	1
offence,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
Jews,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God:	1
10:33	1
Even	1
as	1
I	1
please	1
all	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
not	1
seeking	1
mine	1
own	1
profit,	1
but	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
many,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
saved.	1
	1
11:1	1
Be	1
ye	1
followers	1
of	1
me,	1
even	1
as	1
I	1
also	1
am	1
of	1
Christ.	1
	1
11:2	1
Now	1
I	1
praise	1
you,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
ye	1
remember	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
keep	1
the	1
ordinances,	1
as	1
I	1
delivered	1
them	1
to	1
you.	1
	1
11:3	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
is	1
Christ;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
man;	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Christ	1
is	1
God.	1
	1
11:4	1
Every	1
man	1
praying	1
or	1
prophesying,	1
having	1
his	1
head	1
covered,	1
dishonoureth	1
his	1
head.	1
	1
11:5	1
But	1
every	1
woman	1
that	1
prayeth	1
or	1
prophesieth	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
uncovered	1
dishonoureth	1
her	1
head:	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
even	1
all	1
one	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
shaven.	1
	1
11:6	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
woman	1
be	1
not	1
covered,	1
let	1
her	1
also	1
be	1
shorn:	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
be	1
shorn	1
or	1
shaven,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
covered.	1
	1
11:7	1
For	1
a	1
man	1
indeed	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
head,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
image	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
God:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:8	1
For	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
woman:	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:9	1
Neither	1
was	1
the	1
man	1
created	1
for	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
the	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
man.	1
	1
11:10	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
ought	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
angels.	1
	1
11:11	1
Nevertheless	1
neither	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
without	1
the	1
woman,	1
neither	1
the	1
woman	1
without	1
the	1
man,	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
woman	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
even	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
also	1
by	1
the	1
woman;	1
but	1
all	1
things	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:13	1
Judge	1
in	1
yourselves:	1
is	1
it	1
comely	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
pray	1
unto	1
God	1
uncovered?	1
	1
11:14	1
Doth	1
not	1
even	1
nature	1
itself	1
teach	1
you,	1
that,	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
unto	1
him?	1
	1
11:15	1
But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
have	1
long	1
hair,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
glory	1
to	1
her:	1
for	1
her	1
hair	1
is	1
given	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
covering.	1
	1
11:16	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
contentious,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
custom,	1
neither	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
11:17	1
Now	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not,	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
better,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
	1
11:18	1
For	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
I	1
hear	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
divisions	1
among	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
partly	1
believe	1
it.	1
	1
11:19	1
For	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
also	1
heresies	1
among	1
you,	1
that	1
they	1
which	1
are	1
approved	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
manifest	1
among	1
you.	1
	1
11:20	1
When	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
therefore	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
Lord's	1
supper.	1
	1
11:21	1
For	1
in	1
eating	1
every	1
one	1
taketh	1
before	1
other	1
his	1
own	1
supper:	1
and	1
one	1
is	1
hungry,	1
and	1
another	1
is	1
drunken.	1
	1
11:22	1
What?	1
have	1
ye	1
not	1
houses	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
to	1
drink	1
in?	1
or	1
despise	1
ye	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
shame	1
them	1
that	1
have	1
not?	1
What	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you?	1
shall	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
in	1
this?	1
I	1
praise	1
you	1
not.	1
	1
11:23	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
that	1
which	1
also	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you,	1
That	1
the	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
betrayed	1
took	1
bread:	1
11:24	1
And	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
thanks,	1
he	1
brake	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
Take,	1
eat:	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
body,	1
which	1
is	1
broken	1
for	1
you:	1
this	1
do	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:25	1
After	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
also	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
cup,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
supped,	1
saying,	1
This	1
cup	1
is	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
in	1
my	1
blood:	1
this	1
do	1
ye,	1
as	1
oft	1
as	1
ye	1
drink	1
it,	1
in	1
remembrance	1
of	1
me.	1
	1
11:26	1
For	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
ye	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup,	1
ye	1
do	1
shew	1
the	1
Lord's	1
death	1
till	1
he	1
come.	1
	1
11:27	1
Wherefore	1
whosoever	1
shall	1
eat	1
this	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
this	1
cup	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
unworthily,	1
shall	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
11:28	1
But	1
let	1
a	1
man	1
examine	1
himself,	1
and	1
so	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
of	1
that	1
bread,	1
and	1
drink	1
of	1
that	1
cup.	1
	1
11:29	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
unworthily,	1
eateth	1
and	1
drinketh	1
damnation	1
to	1
himself,	1
not	1
discerning	1
the	1
Lord's	1
body.	1
	1
11:30	1
For	1
this	1
cause	1
many	1
are	1
weak	1
and	1
sickly	1
among	1
you,	1
and	1
many	1
sleep.	1
	1
11:31	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
would	1
judge	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
judged.	1
	1
11:32	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
judged,	1
we	1
are	1
chastened	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
condemned	1
with	1
the	1
world.	1
	1
11:33	1
Wherefore,	1
my	1
brethren,	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
eat,	1
tarry	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
11:34	1
And	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
hunger,	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
at	1
home;	1
that	1
ye	1
come	1
not	1
together	1
unto	1
condemnation.	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
will	1
I	1
set	1
in	1
order	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
12:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
you	1
ignorant.	1
	1
12:2	1
Ye	1
know	1
that	1
ye	1
were	1
Gentiles,	1
carried	1
away	1
unto	1
these	1
dumb	1
idols,	1
even	1
as	1
ye	1
were	1
led.	1
	1
12:3	1
Wherefore	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
speaking	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
of	1
God	1
calleth	1
Jesus	1
accursed:	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
Jesus	1
is	1
the	1
Lord,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
Holy	1
Ghost.	1
	1
12:4	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
gifts,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:5	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
differences	1
of	1
administrations,	1
but	1
the	1
same	1
Lord.	1
	1
12:6	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
diversities	1
of	1
operations,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
God	1
which	1
worketh	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
12:7	1
But	1
the	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
Spirit	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
profit	1
withal.	1
	1
12:8	1
For	1
to	1
one	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
Spirit	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
wisdom;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
knowledge	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:9	1
To	1
another	1
faith	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
Spirit;	1
12:10	1
To	1
another	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
miracles;	1
to	1
another	1
prophecy;	1
to	1
another	1
discerning	1
of	1
spirits;	1
to	1
another	1
divers	1
kinds	1
of	1
tongues;	1
to	1
another	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
tongues:	1
12:11	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
worketh	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
selfsame	1
Spirit,	1
dividing	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
severally	1
as	1
he	1
will.	1
	1
12:12	1
For	1
as	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
hath	1
many	1
members,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
one	1
body,	1
being	1
many,	1
are	1
one	1
body:	1
so	1
also	1
is	1
Christ.	1
	1
12:13	1
For	1
by	1
one	1
Spirit	1
are	1
we	1
all	1
baptized	1
into	1
one	1
body,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
Jews	1
or	1
Gentiles,	1
whether	1
we	1
be	1
bond	1
or	1
free;	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
made	1
to	1
drink	1
into	1
one	1
Spirit.	1
	1
12:14	1
For	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
member,	1
but	1
many.	1
	1
12:15	1
If	1
the	1
foot	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:16	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
ear	1
shall	1
say,	1
Because	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
eye,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
is	1
it	1
therefore	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:17	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
were	1
an	1
eye,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
hearing?	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
were	1
hearing,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
smelling?	1
	1
12:18	1
But	1
now	1
hath	1
God	1
set	1
the	1
members	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him.	1
	1
12:19	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
one	1
member,	1
where	1
were	1
the	1
body?	1
	1
12:20	1
But	1
now	1
are	1
they	1
many	1
members,	1
yet	1
but	1
one	1
body.	1
	1
12:21	1
And	1
the	1
eye	1
cannot	1
say	1
unto	1
the	1
hand,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
thee:	1
nor	1
again	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
feet,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
you.	1
	1
12:22	1
Nay,	1
much	1
more	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
feeble,	1
are	1
necessary:	1
12:23	1
And	1
those	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
we	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
honourable,	1
upon	1
these	1
we	1
bestow	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour;	1
and	1
our	1
uncomely	1
parts	1
have	1
more	1
abundant	1
comeliness.	1
	1
12:24	1
For	1
our	1
comely	1
parts	1
have	1
no	1
need:	1
but	1
God	1
hath	1
tempered	1
the	1
body	1
together,	1
having	1
given	1
more	1
abundant	1
honour	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
which	1
lacked.	1
	1
12:25	1
That	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
schism	1
in	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
care	1
one	1
for	1
another.	1
	1
12:26	1
And	1
whether	1
one	1
member	1
suffer,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
suffer	1
with	1
it;	1
or	1
one	1
member	1
be	1
honoured,	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
rejoice	1
with	1
it.	1
	1
12:27	1
Now	1
ye	1
are	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Christ,	1
and	1
members	1
in	1
particular.	1
	1
12:28	1
And	1
God	1
hath	1
set	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
first	1
apostles,	1
secondarily	1
prophets,	1
thirdly	1
teachers,	1
after	1
that	1
miracles,	1
then	1
gifts	1
of	1
healings,	1
helps,	1
governments,	1
diversities	1
of	1
tongues.	1
	1
12:29	1
Are	1
all	1
apostles?	1
are	1
all	1
prophets?	1
are	1
all	1
teachers?	1
are	1
all	1
workers	1
of	1
miracles?	1
	1
12:30	1
Have	1
all	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
healing?	1
do	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues?	1
do	1
all	1
interpret?	1
	1
12:31	1
But	1
covet	1
earnestly	1
the	1
best	1
gifts:	1
and	1
yet	1
shew	1
I	1
unto	1
you	1
a	1
more	1
excellent	1
way.	1
	1
13:1	1
Though	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
tongues	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
of	1
angels,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
become	1
as	1
sounding	1
brass,	1
or	1
a	1
tinkling	1
cymbal.	1
	1
13:2	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
and	1
understand	1
all	1
mysteries,	1
and	1
all	1
knowledge;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
all	1
faith,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
remove	1
mountains,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
I	1
am	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:3	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
bestow	1
all	1
my	1
goods	1
to	1
feed	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
give	1
my	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
charity,	1
it	1
profiteth	1
me	1
nothing.	1
	1
13:4	1
Charity	1
suffereth	1
long,	1
and	1
is	1
kind;	1
charity	1
envieth	1
not;	1
charity	1
vaunteth	1
not	1
itself,	1
is	1
not	1
puffed	1
up,	1
13:5	1
Doth	1
not	1
behave	1
itself	1
unseemly,	1
seeketh	1
not	1
her	1
own,	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
provoked,	1
thinketh	1
no	1
evil;	1
13:6	1
Rejoiceth	1
not	1
in	1
iniquity,	1
but	1
rejoiceth	1
in	1
the	1
truth;	1
13:7	1
Beareth	1
all	1
things,	1
believeth	1
all	1
things,	1
hopeth	1
all	1
things,	1
endureth	1
all	1
things.	1
	1
13:8	1
Charity	1
never	1
faileth:	1
but	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
prophecies,	1
they	1
shall	1
fail;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
tongues,	1
they	1
shall	1
cease;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
shall	1
vanish	1
away.	1
	1
13:9	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
in	1
part,	1
and	1
we	1
prophesy	1
in	1
part.	1
	1
13:10	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
perfect	1
is	1
come,	1
then	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
part	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
away.	1
	1
13:11	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
spake	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
understood	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
I	1
thought	1
as	1
a	1
child:	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
became	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
put	1
away	1
childish	1
things.	1
	1
13:12	1
For	1
now	1
we	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
glass,	1
darkly;	1
but	1
then	1
face	1
to	1
face:	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
in	1
part;	1
but	1
then	1
shall	1
I	1
know	1
even	1
as	1
also	1
I	1
am	1
known.	1
	1
13:13	1
And	1
now	1
abideth	1
faith,	1
hope,	1
charity,	1
these	1
three;	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
charity.	1
	1
14:1	1
Follow	1
after	1
charity,	1
and	1
desire	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
prophesy.	1
	1
14:2	1
For	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
speaketh	1
not	1
unto	1
men,	1
but	1
unto	1
God:	1
for	1
no	1
man	1
understandeth	1
him;	1
howbeit	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
he	1
speaketh	1
mysteries.	1
	1
14:3	1
But	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
speaketh	1
unto	1
men	1
to	1
edification,	1
and	1
exhortation,	1
and	1
comfort.	1
	1
14:4	1
He	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
edifieth	1
himself;	1
but	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
edifieth	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:5	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
ye	1
all	1
spake	1
with	1
tongues	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
ye	1
prophesied:	1
for	1
greater	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
prophesieth	1
than	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
with	1
tongues,	1
except	1
he	1
interpret,	1
that	1
the	1
church	1
may	1
receive	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:6	1
Now,	1
brethren,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
unto	1
you	1
speaking	1
with	1
tongues,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
profit	1
you,	1
except	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
either	1
by	1
revelation,	1
or	1
by	1
knowledge,	1
or	1
by	1
prophesying,	1
or	1
by	1
doctrine?	1
	1
14:7	1
And	1
even	1
things	1
without	1
life	1
giving	1
sound,	1
whether	1
pipe	1
or	1
harp,	1
except	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
distinction	1
in	1
the	1
sounds,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
piped	1
or	1
harped?	1
	1
14:8	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
trumpet	1
give	1
an	1
uncertain	1
sound,	1
who	1
shall	1
prepare	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
battle?	1
	1
14:9	1
So	1
likewise	1
ye,	1
except	1
ye	1
utter	1
by	1
the	1
tongue	1
words	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
how	1
shall	1
it	1
be	1
known	1
what	1
is	1
spoken?	1
for	1
ye	1
shall	1
speak	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
	1
14:10	1
There	1
are,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
so	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
without	1
signification.	1
	1
14:11	1
Therefore	1
if	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
voice,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
a	1
barbarian,	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
speaketh	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
barbarian	1
unto	1
me.	1
	1
14:12	1
Even	1
so	1
ye,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
zealous	1
of	1
spiritual	1
gifts,	1
seek	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
excel	1
to	1
the	1
edifying	1
of	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:13	1
Wherefore	1
let	1
him	1
that	1
speaketh	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue	1
pray	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:14	1
For	1
if	1
I	1
pray	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
my	1
spirit	1
prayeth,	1
but	1
my	1
understanding	1
is	1
unfruitful.	1
	1
14:15	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
then?	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also:	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
sing	1
with	1
the	1
understanding	1
also.	1
	1
14:16	1
Else	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
bless	1
with	1
the	1
spirit,	1
how	1
shall	1
he	1
that	1
occupieth	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
unlearned	1
say	1
Amen	1
at	1
thy	1
giving	1
of	1
thanks,	1
seeing	1
he	1
understandeth	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest?	1
	1
14:17	1
For	1
thou	1
verily	1
givest	1
thanks	1
well,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
not	1
edified.	1
	1
14:18	1
I	1
thank	1
my	1
God,	1
I	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues	1
more	1
than	1
ye	1
all:	1
14:19	1
Yet	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
speak	1
five	1
words	1
with	1
my	1
understanding,	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
voice	1
I	1
might	1
teach	1
others	1
also,	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
words	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue.	1
	1
14:20	1
Brethren,	1
be	1
not	1
children	1
in	1
understanding:	1
howbeit	1
in	1
malice	1
be	1
ye	1
children,	1
but	1
in	1
understanding	1
be	1
men.	1
	1
14:21	1
In	1
the	1
law	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
With	1
men	1
of	1
other	1
tongues	1
and	1
other	1
lips	1
will	1
I	1
speak	1
unto	1
this	1
people;	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
hear	1
me,	1
saith	1
the	1
LORD.	1
	1
14:22	1
Wherefore	1
tongues	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
sign,	1
not	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe,	1
but	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not:	1
but	1
prophesying	1
serveth	1
not	1
for	1
them	1
that	1
believe	1
not,	1
but	1
for	1
them	1
which	1
believe.	1
	1
14:23	1
If	1
therefore	1
the	1
whole	1
church	1
be	1
come	1
together	1
into	1
one	1
place,	1
and	1
all	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
unlearned,	1
or	1
unbelievers,	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
mad?	1
	1
14:24	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
there	1
come	1
in	1
one	1
that	1
believeth	1
not,	1
or	1
one	1
unlearned,	1
he	1
is	1
convinced	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
is	1
judged	1
of	1
all:	1
14:25	1
And	1
thus	1
are	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
made	1
manifest;	1
and	1
so	1
falling	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
he	1
will	1
worship	1
God,	1
and	1
report	1
that	1
God	1
is	1
in	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
truth.	1
	1
14:26	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
then,	1
brethren?	1
when	1
ye	1
come	1
together,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
hath	1
a	1
psalm,	1
hath	1
a	1
doctrine,	1
hath	1
a	1
tongue,	1
hath	1
a	1
revelation,	1
hath	1
an	1
interpretation.	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
unto	1
edifying.	1
	1
14:27	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
speak	1
in	1
an	1
unknown	1
tongue,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
two,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
by	1
three,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
course;	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
interpret.	1
	1
14:28	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
interpreter,	1
let	1
him	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
church;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
speak	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
God.	1
	1
14:29	1
Let	1
the	1
prophets	1
speak	1
two	1
or	1
three,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
other	1
judge.	1
	1
14:30	1
If	1
any	1
thing	1
be	1
revealed	1
to	1
another	1
that	1
sitteth	1
by,	1
let	1
the	1
first	1
hold	1
his	1
peace.	1
	1
14:31	1
For	1
ye	1
may	1
all	1
prophesy	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
that	1
all	1
may	1
learn,	1
and	1
all	1
may	1
be	1
comforted.	1
	1
14:32	1
And	1
the	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
prophets	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
prophets.	1
	1
14:33	1
For	1
God	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
confusion,	1
but	1
of	1
peace,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
saints.	1
	1
14:34	1
Let	1
your	1
women	1
keep	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
churches:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
unto	1
them	1
to	1
speak;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
obedience	1
as	1
also	1
saith	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
14:35	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
learn	1
any	1
thing,	1
let	1
them	1
ask	1
their	1
husbands	1
at	1
home:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
for	1
women	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
church.	1
	1
14:36	1
What?	1
came	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
God	1
out	1
from	1
you?	1
or	1
came	1
it	1
unto	1
you	1
only?	1
	1
14:37	1
If	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prophet,	1
or	1
spiritual,	1
let	1
him	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
write	1
unto	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
commandments	1
of	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
14:38	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
man	1
be	1
ignorant,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
ignorant.	1
	1
14:39	1
Wherefore,	1
brethren,	1
covet	1
to	1
prophesy,	1
and	1
forbid	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
tongues.	1
	1
14:40	1
Let	1
all	1
things	1
be	1
done	1
decently	1
and	1
in	1
order.	1
	1
15:1	1
Moreover,	1
brethren,	1
I	1
declare	1
unto	1
you	1
the	1
gospel	1
which	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
have	1
received,	1
and	1
wherein	1
ye	1
stand;	1
15:2	1
By	1
which	1
also	1
ye	1
are	1
saved,	1
if	1
ye	1
keep	1
in	1
memory	1
what	1
I	1
preached	1
unto	1
you,	1
unless	1
ye	1
have	1
believed	1
in	1
vain.	1
	1
15:3	1
For	1
I	1
delivered	1
unto	1
you	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
also	1
received,	1
how	1
that	1
Christ	1
died	1
for	1
our	1
sins	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures;	1
15:4	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
again	1
the	1
third	1
day	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
scriptures:	1
15:5	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
Cephas,	1
then	1
of	1
the	1
twelve:	1
15:6	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
above	1
five	1
hundred	1
brethren	1
at	1
once;	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
remain	1
unto	1
this	1
present,	1
but	1
some	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep.	1
	1
15:7	1
After	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
James;	1
then	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
apostles.	1
	1
15:8	1
And	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
was	1
seen	1
of	1
me	1
also,	1
as	1
of	1
one	1
born	1
out	1
of	1
due	1
time.	1
	1
15:9	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
apostles,	1
that	1
am	1
not	1
meet	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
apostle,	1
because	1
I	1
persecuted	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
God.	1
	1
15:10	1
But	1
by	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
what	1
I	1
am:	1
and	1
his	1
grace	1
which	1
was	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
vain;	1
but	1
I	1
laboured	1
more	1
abundantly	1
than	1
they	1
all:	1
yet	1
not	1
I,	1
but	1
the	1
grace	1
of	1
God	1
which	1
was	1
with	1
me.	1
	1
15:11	1
Therefore	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
I	1
or	1
they,	1
so	1
we	1
preach,	1
and	1
so	1
ye	1
believed.	1
	1
15:12	1
Now	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
preached	1
that	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
how	1
say	1
some	1
among	1
you	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:13	1
But	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead,	1
then	1
is	1
Christ	1
not	1
risen:	1
15:14	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
risen,	1
then	1
is	1
our	1
preaching	1
vain,	1
and	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
also	1
vain.	1
	1
15:15	1
Yea,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
found	1
false	1
witnesses	1
of	1
God;	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
testified	1
of	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
raised	1
up	1
Christ:	1
whom	1
he	1
raised	1
not	1
up,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not.	1
	1
15:16	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not,	1
then	1
is	1
not	1
Christ	1
raised:	1
15:17	1
And	1
if	1
Christ	1
be	1
not	1
raised,	1
your	1
faith	1
is	1
vain;	1
ye	1
are	1
yet	1
in	1
your	1
sins.	1
	1
15:18	1
Then	1
they	1
also	1
which	1
are	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
in	1
Christ	1
are	1
perished.	1
	1
15:19	1
If	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
only	1
we	1
have	1
hope	1
in	1
Christ,	1
we	1
are	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
most	1
miserable.	1
	1
15:20	1
But	1
now	1
is	1
Christ	1
risen	1
from	1
the	1
dead,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
firstfruits	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
slept.	1
	1
15:21	1
For	1
since	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
death,	1
by	1
man	1
came	1
also	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
	1
15:22	1
For	1
as	1
in	1
Adam	1
all	1
die,	1
even	1
so	1
in	1
Christ	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
made	1
alive.	1
	1
15:23	1
But	1
every	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
order:	1
Christ	1
the	1
firstfruits;	1
afterward	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
Christ's	1
at	1
his	1
coming.	1
	1
15:24	1
Then	1
cometh	1
the	1
end,	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
delivered	1
up	1
the	1
kingdom	1
to	1
God,	1
even	1
the	1
Father;	1
when	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
rule	1
and	1
all	1
authority	1
and	1
power.	1
	1
15:25	1
For	1
he	1
must	1
reign,	1
till	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
enemies	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
	1
15:26	1
The	1
last	1
enemy	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
destroyed	1
is	1
death.	1
	1
15:27	1
For	1
he	1
hath	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
his	1
feet.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
saith	1
all	1
things	1
are	1
put	1
under	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
manifest	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
excepted,	1
which	1
did	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him.	1
	1
15:28	1
And	1
when	1
all	1
things	1
shall	1
be	1
subdued	1
unto	1
him,	1
then	1
shall	1
the	1
Son	1
also	1
himself	1
be	1
subject	1
unto	1
him	1
that	1
put	1
all	1
things	1
under	1
him,	1
that	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
all.	1
	1
15:29	1
Else	1
what	1
shall	1
they	1
do	1
which	1
are	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not	1
at	1
all?	1
why	1
are	1
they	1
then	1
baptized	1
for	1
the	1
dead?	1
	1
15:30	1
And	1
why	1
stand	1
we	1
in	1
jeopardy	1
every	1
hour?	1
	1
15:31	1
I	1
protest	1
by	1
your	1
rejoicing	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
Christ	1
Jesus	1
our	1
LORD,	1
I	1
die	1
daily.	1
	1
15:32	1
If	1
after	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
men	1
I	1
have	1
fought	1
with	1
beasts	1
at	1
Ephesus,	1
what	1
advantageth	1
it	1
me,	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
rise	1
not?	1
let	1
us	1
eat	1
and	1
drink;	1
for	1
to	1
morrow	1
we	1
die.	1
	1
15:33	1
Be	1
not	1
deceived:	1
evil	1
communications	1
corrupt	1
good	1
manners.	1
	1
15:34	1
Awake	1
to	1
righteousness,	1
and	1
sin	1
not;	1
for	1
some	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God:	1
I	1
speak	1
this	1
to	1
your	1
shame.	1
	1
15:35	1
But	1
some	1
man	1
will	1
say,	1
How	1
are	1
the	1
dead	1
raised	1
up?	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
body	1
do	1
they	1
come?	1
	1
15:36	1
Thou	1
fool,	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest	1
is	1
not	1
quickened,	1
except	1
it	1
die:	1
15:37	1
And	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sowest,	1
thou	1
sowest	1
not	1
that	1
body	1
that	1
shall	1
be,	1
but	1
bare	1
grain,	1
it	1
may	1
chance	1
of	1
wheat,	1
or	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
grain:	1
15:38	1
But	1
God	1
giveth	1
it	1
a	1
body	1
as	1
it	1
hath	1
pleased	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
seed	1
his	1
own	1
body.	1
	1
15:39	1
All	1
flesh	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
flesh:	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
flesh	1
of	1
men,	1
another	1
flesh	1
of	1
beasts,	1
another	1
of	1
fishes,	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
birds.	1
	1
15:40	1
There	1
are	1
also	1
celestial	1
bodies,	1
and	1
bodies	1
terrestrial:	1
but	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
celestial	1
is	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
is	1
another.	1
	1
15:41	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
another	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
stars:	1
for	1
one	1
star	1
differeth	1
from	1
another	1
star	1
in	1
glory.	1
	1
15:42	1
So	1
also	1
is	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
the	1
dead.	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
corruption;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
incorruption:	1
15:43	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
dishonour;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
glory:	1
it	1
is	1
sown	1
in	1
weakness;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
in	1
power:	1
15:44	1
It	1
is	1
sown	1
a	1
natural	1
body;	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
body,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spiritual	1
body.	1
	1
15:45	1
And	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
living	1
soul;	1
the	1
last	1
Adam	1
was	1
made	1
a	1
quickening	1
spirit.	1
	1
15:46	1
Howbeit	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
first	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
natural;	1
and	1
afterward	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
spiritual.	1
	1
15:47	1
The	1
first	1
man	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
earthy;	1
the	1
second	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
Lord	1
from	1
heaven.	1
	1
15:48	1
As	1
is	1
the	1
earthy,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
earthy:	1
and	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
heavenly,	1
such	1
are	1
they	1
also	1
that	1
are	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:49	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
earthy,	1
we	1
shall	1
also	1
bear	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
heavenly.	1
	1
15:50	1
Now	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
brethren,	1
that	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
cannot	1
inherit	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
God;	1
neither	1
doth	1
corruption	1
inherit	1
incorruption.	1
	1
15:51	1
Behold,	1
I	1
shew	1
you	1
a	1
mystery;	1
We	1
shall	1
not	1
all	1
sleep,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
changed,	1
15:52	1
In	1
a	1
moment,	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
trump:	1
for	1
the	1
trumpet	1
shall	1
sound,	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
shall	1
be	1
raised	1
incorruptible,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
changed.	1
	1
15:53	1
For	1
this	1
corruptible	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
must	1
put	1
on	1
immortality.	1
	1
15:54	1
So	1
when	1
this	1
corruptible	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
incorruption,	1
and	1
this	1
mortal	1
shall	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
immortality,	1
then	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
saying	1
that	1
is	1
written,	1
Death	1
is	1
swallowed	1
up	1
in	1
victory.	1
	1
15:55	1
O	1
death,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
sting?	1
O	1
grave,	1
where	1
is	1
thy	1
victory?	1
15:56	1
The	1
sting	1
of	1
death	1
is	1
sin;	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
sin	1
is	1
the	1
law.	1
	1
15:57	1
But	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
which	1
giveth	1
us	1
the	1
victory	1
through	1
our	1
Lord	1
Jesus	1
Christ.	1
	1
15:58	1
Therefore,	1
my	1
beloved	1
brethren,	1
be	1
ye	1
stedfast,	1
unmoveable,	1
always	1
abounding	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
Lord,	1
forasmuch	1
as	1
ye	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
labour	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
vain	1
in	1
the	1
Lord.	1
	1
16:1	1
Now	1
concerning	1
the	1
collection	1
for	1
the	1
saints,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
churches	1
of	1
Galatia,	1
even	1
so	1
do	1
ye.	1
	1
16:2	1
Upon	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
let	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
lay	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
store,	1
as	1
God	1
hath	1
prospered	1
him,	1
that	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
gatherings	1
when	1
I	1
come.	1
	1
16:3	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
come,	1
whomsoever	1
ye	1
shall	1
approve	1
by	1
your	1
letters,	1
them	1
will	1
I	1
send	1
to	1
bring	1
your	1
liberality	1
unto	1
Jerusalem.	1
